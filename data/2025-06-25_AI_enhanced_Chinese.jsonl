Current Large Language Models (LLMs), while\nadept at text-to-SQL translation, have not been rigorously evaluated on the\nmore challenging task of debugging SQL issues. To address this gap, we\nintroduce BIRD-CRITIC, a new SQL issue debugging benchmark comprising 530\nPostgreSQL tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-PG) and 570 multi-dialect tasks\n(BIRD-CRITIC-Multi), distilled from authentic user issues and replayed within\nnew environments to facilitate rigorous evaluation. Baseline evaluations\nunderscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini\nachieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on\nBIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks\nis crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy.\nTherefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for\nelevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This\nenvironment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates\nexecutable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified\nSQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore\nsubstantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which\nextracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs\nto produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training. We integrate these\ncomponents into an open-source agent, Bird-Fixer. Based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B,\nBird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on\nBIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing leading proprietary models such as\nClaude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, marking a significant step toward democratizing\nsophisticated SQL-debugging capabilities.

However,\nrepeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic\nfailures or high execution costs.

This paper introduces WiLLM, the first open-source wireless\nsystem specifically designed for these services. First, we establish a new\nparadigm by deploying LLMs in core networks (CNs) with abundant GPUs. This\nenables distributed inference services, strategically positioning LLM inference\nat the convergence of backbone bandwidth and the cellular network's edge.\nSecond, we propose an innovative \"Tree-Branch-Fruit\" extension to the\nconventional network slicing architecture. This specialized design allows\ntelecom operators to monetize LLM services through slice subscriptions while\nmaintaining infrastructure ownership. Finally, to realize this vision, WiLLM\naddresses critical limitations in current solutions with several novel\ncapabilities. It features enhanced slice orchestration through a dual-layer\nslicing architecture, enabling coordinated multi-UE-multi-slice scheduling for\nfiner-grained resource allocation. To ensure universal compatibility, an\napplication-layer tunneling mechanism allows legacy devices without native\nslicing to access LLM slice services without hardware upgrades. Furthermore,\nits dual-mode scheduling and cross-layer APIs support flexible deployment from\nCNs to servers. Built on OpenAirInterface, WiLLM extends this established\nframework, lowering the adoption barrier for researchers. We also release the\nfirst LLM wireless communication dataset with 1,649,996 records and\nsynchronized 58-dimensional metrics, alongside two benchmarks. A case study\nwith smart glasses demonstrates practical viability for resource-constrained\ndevices. WiLLM aims to foster an open platform for cross-layer optimization and\nAI-telecom convergence.

It is a natural\ngeneralization of the classical proper coloring, in which each color must\ninstead induce an independent set. Similarly to proper coloring, we define the\nsubchromatic number of a graph as the minimum integer k such that it admits a\nsubcoloring with k colors, and the corresponding problem k-Subcoloring which\nasks whether a graph has subchromatic number at most k. In this paper, we\ninitiate the study of the subcoloring of (unit) disk graphs. One motivation\nstems from the fact that disk graphs can be seen as a dense generalization of\nplanar graphs where, intuitively, each vertex can be blown into a large\nclique--much like subcoloring generalizes proper coloring. Interestingly, it\ncan be observed that every unit disk graph admits a subcoloring with at most 7\ncolors. We first prove that the subchromatic number can be 3-approximated in\npolynomial-time in unit disk graphs. We then present several hardness results\nfor special cases of unit disk graphs which somehow prevents the use of\nclassical approaches for improving this result. We show in particular that\n2-subcoloring remains NP-hard in triangle-free unit disk graphs, as well as in\nunit disk graphs representable within a strip of bounded height. We also solve\nan open question of Broersma, Fomin, Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il, and Woeginger (2002) by\nproving that 3-Subcoloring remains NP-hard in co-comparability graphs. Finally,\nwe prove that every $n$-vertex disk graph admits a subcoloring with at most\n$O(\\log^3(n))$ colors and present a $O(\\log^2(n))$-approximation algorithm for\ncomputing the subchromatic number of such graphs.

However, it\nis fundamentally constrained by the capability to model the target code\nincluding library functions in terms of symbolic constraint and the capability\nof underlying constraint solvers. As a result, many paths involving complex\nfeatures remain unanalyzed or insufficiently modeled. Recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating diverse and valid test\ninputs. Yet, LLMs lack mechanisms for systematically enumerating program paths\nand often fail to cover subtle corner cases.

In\nthis paper, we present PALM, a test generation system that combines symbolic\npath enumeration with LLM-assisted test generation. PALM statically enumerates\npossible paths through AST-level analysis and transforms each into an\nexecutable variant with embedded assertions that specify the target path.

We give a deterministic algorithm that constructs the BFS tree in\n$O(\\min(D\\Delta, m\\log n) + n\\log n + \\Delta \\log^2 n)$ rounds using $O(\\log\nn)$ bits per agent without root knowledge. To determine the root, we solve\nleader election and MST construction. We elect a leader and construct the MST\nin $O(n\\log n + \\Delta \\log^2 n)$ rounds, with $O(\\log n)$ bits per agent.\nPrior MST algorithms require $O(m + n\\log n)$ rounds and $\\max(\\Delta, \\log n)\n\\log n$ bits. Our results significantly improve memory efficiency and time,\nachieving nearly linear-time leader election and MST. Agents are assumed to\nknow $\\lambda$, the maximum identifier, bounded by a polynomial in $n$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u6700\u5c0f\u751f\u6210\u6811\uff08MST\uff09\u548c\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\uff08BFS\uff09\u6811\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\uff0cMST\u548cBFS\u6811\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u9759\u6001\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u56fe\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u3001\u8fb9\u6570\u3001\u76f4\u5f84\u7b49\uff09\u65e0\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86BFS\u6811\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u548cMST\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "result": "BFS\u6811\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3aO(min(D\u0394, m log n) + n log n + \u0394 log\u00b2 n)\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4e3aO(log n)\u4f4d/\u4ee3\u7406\uff1bMST\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3aO(n log n + \u0394 log\u00b2 n)\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4e3aO(log n)\u4f4d/\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd1\u4e4e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u548cMST\u6784\u5efa\u3002"}}

We assess the performance of the\nconsidered models using various imagery and pointcloud metrics, comparing them\nagainst the baseline Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that the N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves\nreconstruction quality, making it feasible for small UAVs to support\nhigh-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments.

To manage these computational and storage\ndemands, centralized workflow and data management systems are implemented.\nHowever, decisions regarding data placement and payload allocation are often\nmade disjointly and via heuristic means.

However, the conventional wear-leveling (WL) paradigm\napplied during scaling suffers from a fundamental flaw: it ignores the\nnon-linear relationship between wear and failure probability, potentially\npushing the most vulnerable, aged disks towards premature failure. To address\nthis critical issue at its root, we propose the Probability-Sensitive Wear\nLeveling (PS-WL) scheme, which shifts the optimization goal from balancing wear\nto directly balancing failure risk. At its core, PS-WL introduces an \"effective\nlifetime\" model derived from a realistic failure probability to more accurately\nassess disk lifetime. This model guides a PID controller for wear leveling\noperation, with a conservative zone minimizes performance overhead by\nrestricting warm data migration.

Discrete-event simulation was most commonly used,\nreflecting the model's sequential nature. Early work relied on proprietary\nplatforms, while recent studies increasingly use open-source, Python-based\ntools.

The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time\nand 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various\nhydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation\nmodel, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on\nthe physical correlation between the new variables and those used during\npretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical\nrelationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for\nfoundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new\nvariables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for\nmaking foundation models more accessible to communities with limited\ncomputational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences.", "AI": {"tldr": "Aurora\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u7684\u6c34\u6587\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u6bd4\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30Aurora\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6c34\u6587\u53d8\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6d45\u5c42\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u9884\u6d4b\u65b0\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c1150%\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c35%\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0b\u6269\u5c55\u65b0\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5730\u7403\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

We conduct the first\ncomprehensive analysis of topology-based privacy leakage across realistic\nadversarial knowledge scenarios, demonstrating that adversaries with varying\ndegrees of structural knowledge can infer sensitive data distribution patterns\neven under strong differential privacy guarantees. Through systematic\nevaluation of 4,720 attack instances, we analyze six distinct adversarial\nknowledge scenarios: complete topology knowledge and five partial knowledge\nconfigurations reflecting real-world deployment constraints. We propose three\ncomplementary attack vectors: communication pattern analysis, parameter\nmagnitude profiling, and structural position correlation, achieving success\nrates of 84.1%, 65.0%, and 47.2% under complete knowledge conditions.\nCritically, we find that 80% of realistic partial knowledge scenarios maintain\nattack effectiveness above security thresholds, with certain partial knowledge\nconfigurations achieving performance superior to the baseline complete\nknowledge scenario. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose and\nempirically validate structural noise injection as a complementary defense\nmechanism across 808 configurations, demonstrating up to 51.4% additional\nattack reduction when properly layered with existing privacy techniques.

The proposed method combines the distributed\ncollaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature\ndiscrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding\nrepresentations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample\npairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.\nWithout exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a\nfederated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to\nrepresent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system\nlogs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both\ncontrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect\nfine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical\nattack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario\nto examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It\ndemonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing\ncomplex anomalies in distributed environments.

Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM\noutputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a\nuser or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never\nperfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as\ncorrectness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified\nreward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance\n-- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we\ncharacterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when\nand how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this\nphenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we\nintroduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact\napproximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We\nshow that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where\nthe true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of\na broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP.

We show that\na shallow linear SSM with large parameter norms can be represented by a deep\nlinear SSM with smaller norms using a constructive method. In particular, this\ndemonstrates that deep SSMs are more capable of representing targets with large\nnorms than shallow SSMs under norm constraints. Finally, we derive upper bounds\non the minimal depth required for a deep linear SSM to represent a given\nshallow linear SSM under constrained parameter norms.

To address this gap, we initiate an\ninnovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned\nmodels (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one.

As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is\nestimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This\napproach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to\nimproved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are\ninherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question\narises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting\nat the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk\nminimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term\novertuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical\nrelevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML\nliterature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it\nfrom related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale\nreanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of\novertuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously\nassumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases,\novertuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse\ngeneralization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further\nanalyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset\nsize, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss\nmitigation strategies.

However, variations\nin system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to\ndrastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for\nconstructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we\nintroduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks\n(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from\nthe parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the\ninferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The\nlearned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base\nnetwork, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a\ntarget network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution\nconditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of\nmodels rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across\nparameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the\ndynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The\nperformance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical\nsystems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and\nextrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were\nunseen during training. In all cases, our approach outperforms or matches\nstate-of-the-art baselines in both short-term forecast accuracy and in\ncapturing long-term dynamical features, such as attractor statistics.", "AI": {"tldr": "PHLieNet\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4f20\u64ad\u7f51\u7edc\u6743\u91cd\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PHLieNet\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5230\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u7f51\u7edc\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5916\u63a8\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u63d2/\u5916\u63a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5339\u914d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PHLieNet\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

OSP combines three key\ninnovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while\nmaintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing\nchannel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,\nredistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We\nvalidate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is\nthe first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive\n4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10\nbenchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%\ntraining overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis\n(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally\naltering LLM quantization behavior.

This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation\nthat merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation\nnodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph.

While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation\ntechniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,\nadapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,\nsemantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.\nConventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive\nmodifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This\npaper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight\napproach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step\ngenerators without requiring access to original training images or retraining\nthe base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and\nemploys a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss\naligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are\nconditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to\nthe new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as\nminimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the\nconditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,\ndata-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step\ngenerator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nNCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,\nsurpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both\ngeneration quality and computational efficiency.

Token-level speculative decoding (SD)\nhelps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire\n$\\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\\gamma$ grows. This\nmeans allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic\nceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this\nceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of\nparallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,\nand each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.\nIn Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future\nsteps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a\nverifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate\nany that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the\ntwo layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak\nspeedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other\nbenchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x\nwhile preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional\nGPU throughput.

Despite being used as a theoretical basis for developing\nADA approaches, existing ADA surveys lack a comprehensive review and summary of\nmulti-modal depression-related human behaviours. To bridge this gap, this paper\nspecifically summarises depression-related human behaviours across a range of\nmodalities (e.g. the human brain, verbal language and non-verbal\naudio/facial/body behaviours). We focus on conducting an up-to-date and\ncomprehensive survey of ML-based ADA approaches for learning depression cues\nfrom these behaviours as well as discussing and comparing their distinctive\nfeatures and limitations.

(2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:\nUnderstanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of\nProblem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,\nwhere the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a\nspecific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling\nlimitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface.

We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking\nStrategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no\nadditional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition\nsequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling\nindependent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes\nthe joint entropy of each iteration step.

We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon\naverage-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and\nreward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller\ndetermines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a\nprivate reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which\nrepresents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition\nkernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate\nthe problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the\nenvironment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper\nconsiders a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market\ncontinues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the\nVickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient,\ntruthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential\nauctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves\nthese desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an\nonline reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying\nMDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG\nmechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges\nto a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness,\nand individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves\nguaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u52a8\u6001VCG\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e8f\u5217\u62cd\u5356\u4e2d\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6216\u7247\u6bb5\u5f0fMDP\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e8f\u5217\u62cd\u5356\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1MDP\uff0c\u6269\u5c55VCG\u673a\u5236\u81f3\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u673a\u5236\u6e10\u8fd1\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6ee1\u8db3\u6548\u7387\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u7406\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u591a\u79cd\u9057\u61be\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Accurate\nmodeling of the entire atmosphere is critical for understanding the upward\npropagation of gravity waves, which influence upper-atmospheric dynamics and\ncoupling across atmospheric layers. CAM-NET leverages the Spherical Fourier\nNeural Operator (SFNO) to capture global-scale atmospheric dynamics while\npreserving the Earth's spherical structure. Trained on a decade of datasets\nfrom the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and\nionosphere eXtension (WACCM-X), CAM-NET demonstrates accuracy comparable to\nWACCM-X while achieving a speedup of over 1000x in inference time, can provide\none year simulation within a few minutes once trained. The model effectively\npredicts key atmospheric parameters, including zonal and meridional winds,\ntemperature, and time rate of pressure. Inspired by traditional modeling\napproaches that use external couplers to simulate tracer transport, CAM-NET\nintroduces a modular architecture that explicitly separates tracer prediction\nfrom core dynamics.

Unlike\ntraditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each\ntoken depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency\nmakes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can\nsignificantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this\npaper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token\nsimilarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage\nchannels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is\ncombinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To\naddress this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with\nlookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces\nthe residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the\nmessage-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain\ntoken packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a\nlookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates\nwithout replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates\nsampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity.\nExperiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned\nimages) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores\ncomparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up\nto 40$\\times$.

This critical reliability\ngap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)\napplications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective\ndetection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric\nhallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,\noverlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We\ndevelop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,\nwhich enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning\ncapabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,\nscenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed\nmore visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of\nrelation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our\nknowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination\ndetection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation.

We propose a novel technique to (1)\ndetect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically\nrealizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network,\nwhere we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat)\nwith a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56%\naccuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7f51\u7edc\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u690d\u5165\u81ea\u7136\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53d7\u611f\u67d3\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff08\u5982\u7eff\u8272\u592a\u9633\u955c\u6216\u7ea2\u8272\u5e3d\u5b50\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u524d5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523074%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u768456%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent work has introduced quantum extremal\nlearning (QEL), which leverages the expressive power of variational quantum\ncircuits to learn accurate surrogate functions by training on a few data\npoints. However, as widely studied in the classical machine learning\nliterature, predictive models may incorrectly extrapolate objective values in\nunexplored regions, leading to the selection of overly optimistic solutions. In\nthis paper, we propose integrating QEL with conservative objective models (COM)\n- a regularization technique aimed at ensuring cautious predictions on\nout-of-distribution inputs. The resulting hybrid algorithm, COM-QEL, builds on\nthe expressive power of quantum neural networks while safeguarding\ngeneralization via conservative modeling. Empirical results on benchmark\noptimization tasks demonstrate that COM-QEL reliably finds solutions with\nhigher true objective values compared to the original QEL, validating its\nsuperiority for offline design problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u6781\u503c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08QEL\uff09\u548c\u4fdd\u5b88\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\uff08COM\uff09\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5COM-QEL\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e50\u89c2\u7684\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u533a\u57df\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9009\u62e9\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e50\u89c2\u7684\u89e3\u3002QEL\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCOM-QEL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06QEL\u4e0eCOM\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u5b88\u5efa\u6a21\u786e\u4fdd\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cCOM-QEL\u6bd4\u539f\u59cbQEL\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u627e\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "COM-QEL\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4fdd\u5b88\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

KnowRL\nguides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality\nreward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping\nthem recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during\nRL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning\nstrategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning\nsteps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on\nthree hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets\ndemonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking\nmodels while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities.

In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal\nEnergy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish\nas spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical\ndecay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we\npropose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \\log\nn)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute\ndensity, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense\nattention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial\nAttention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to\nspatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal\ndistance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend\ntheir generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive\nexperiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across\nWan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\\times$ speedup\nover the original dense attention.
