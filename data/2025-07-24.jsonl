Given a\nlarge input network $G$, a motif $H$ is a small \"pattern\" graph indicative of\nspecial local structure. Motif/pattern mining involves finding all matches of\nthis pattern in the input $G$. The simplest, yet challenging, case of motif\ncounting is when $H$ has three vertices, often called a \"triadic\" query. Recent\nwork has focused on \"temporal graph mining\", where the network $G$ has edges\nwith timestamps (and directions) and $H$ has time constraints.\n  Inspired by concepts in logic and database theory, we introduce the study of\n\"thresholded First Order Logic (FOL) Motif Analysis\" for massive temporal\nnetworks. A typical triadic motif query asks for the existence of three\nvertices that form a desired temporal pattern. An \"FOL\" motif query is obtained\nby having both existential and thresholded universal quantifiers. This allows\nfor query semantics that can mine richer information from networks. A typical\ntriadic query would be \"find all triples of vertices $u,v,w$ such that they\nform a triangle within one hour\". A thresholded FOL query can express \"find all\npairs $u,v$ such that for half of $w$ where $(u,w)$ formed an edge, $(v,w)$\nalso formed an edge within an hour\".\n  We design the first algorithm, FOLTY, for mining thresholded FOL triadic\nqueries. The theoretical running time of FOLTY matches the best known running\ntime for temporal triangle counting in sparse graphs. We give an efficient\nimplementation of FOLTY using specialized temporal data structures. FOLTY has\nexcellent empirical behavior, and can answer triadic FOL queries on graphs with\nnearly 70M edges is less than hour on commodity hardware. Our work has the\npotential to start a new research direction in the classic well-studied problem\nof motif analysis."}

Despite the increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nautomate software engineering tasks, their ability to generate CI\nconfigurations remains underexplored. This paper presents a preliminary study\nevaluating six LLMs for generating GitHub Actions configurations from natural\nlanguage descriptions. We assess three general-purpose foundation models\n(GPT-4o, Llama, and Gemma) and three code-pretrained models (GPT-4.1, Code\nLlama, and CodeGemma). We also introduce the first labeled dataset of its kind,\nconstructed from GitHub Actions documentation, pairing descriptions with\ncorresponding best-practice YAML configurations. Zero-shot prompting achieves\nup to 69% similarity with the ground truth, with only 3% perfect matches.\nCode-pretrained models slightly underperform compared to general-purpose ones\nin YAML-based CI tasks, revealing LLM limitations for CI configuration\ngeneration. Analyzing GPT-4o outputs reveals issues like missing or renamed\nsteps, misinterpreted descriptions, and unnecessary additions that may affect\nstructural and contextual correctness, indicating a gap between generation\nquality and the precision required for executable CI configurations. Our\nresearch offers insights for improving LLM alignment with configuration\nlanguages and guiding future efforts on CI automation and tooling support."}

The 5G-AKA protocol, standardized\nby 3GPP in TS 33.501, is central to authentication in current 5G deployments.\nIt provides mutual authentication, user privacy, and key secrecy. However,\ndespite its adoption, 5G-AKA has known limitations in both security and\nperformance. While it focuses on protecting privacy against passive attackers,\nrecent studies show its vulnerabilities to active attacks. It also relies on a\nsequence number mechanism to prevent replay attacks, requiring perfect\nsynchronization between the device and the core network. This stateful design\nadds complexity, causes desynchronization, and incurs extra communication\noverhead. More critically, 5G-AKA lacks Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), exposing\npast communications if long-term keys are compromised-an increasing concern\namid sophisticated threats. This paper proposes an enhanced authentication\nprotocol that builds on 5G-AKA's design while addressing its shortcomings.\nFirst, we introduce a stateless version that removes sequence number reliance,\nreducing complexity while staying compatible with existing SIM cards and\ninfrastructure. We then extend this design to add PFS with minimal\ncryptographic overhead. Both protocols are rigorously analyzed using ProVerif,\nconfirming their compliance with all major security requirements, including\nresistance to passive and active attacks, as well as those defined by 3GPP and\nacademic studies. We also prototype both protocols and evaluate their\nperformance against 5G-AKA and 5G-AKA' (USENIX'21). Our results show the\nproposed protocols offer stronger security with only minor computational\noverhead, making them practical, future-ready solutions for 5G and beyond."}

To characterize their\nrespective challenges, we define Initialization Complexity and adopt Cyclomatic\nComplexity to measure the difficulty of prefix and assertion generation,\nrevealing that the former primarily affects compilation success, while the\nlatter influences test coverage. To address these challenges, we propose\nSeed&Steer, a two-step approach that combines traditional unit testing\ntechniques with the capabilities of large language models. Seed&Steer leverages\nconventional unit testing tools (e.g., EvoSuite) to generate method invocations\nwith high compilation success rates, which serve as seeds to guide LLMs in\nconstructing effective test contexts.

MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by\nenforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous\nvelocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a\nlimiting special case of a more fundamental principle.

As the state-of-the-art, branch and bound (BaB) is\na \"divide-and-conquer\" strategy that applies off-the-shelf verifiers to\nsub-problems for which they perform better. While BaB can identify the\nsub-problems that are necessary to be split, it explores the space of these\nsub-problems in a naive \"first-come-first-serve\" manner, thereby suffering from\nan issue of inefficiency to reach a verification conclusion. To bridge this\ngap, we introduce an order over different sub-problems produced by BaB,\nconcerning with their different likelihoods of containing counterexamples.\nBased on this order, we propose a novel verification framework Oliva that\nexplores the sub-problem space by prioritizing those sub-problems that are more\nlikely to find counterexamples, in order to efficiently reach the conclusion of\nthe verification. Even if no counterexample can be found in any sub-problem, it\nonly changes the order of visiting different sub-problem and so will not lead\nto a performance degradation. Specifically, Oliva has two variants, including\n$Oliva^{GR}$, a greedy strategy that always prioritizes the sub-problems that\nare more likely to find counterexamples, and $Oliva^{SA}$, a balanced strategy\ninspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to\nexploitation to locate the globally optimal sub-problems. We experimentally\nevaluate the performance of Oliva on 690 verification problems spanning over 5\nmodels with datasets MNIST and CIFAR10. Compared to the state-of-the-art\napproaches, we demonstrate the speedup of Oliva for up to 25X in MNIST, and up\nto 80X in CIFAR10."}

To mitigate these limitations, existing\napproaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to\nalleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both\nchallenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a\ncomplex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed\nsynchronization steps), and model convergence rate.

Yet despite the appealing simplicity of the C2ST, its\ntheoretical and practical reliability depend upon having access to a\nnear-Bayes-optimal classifier -- a requirement that is rarely met and, at best,\ndifficult to verify.

This approach is particularly advantageous in\ntypical simulation-based inference settings, where only a single draw \\( \\theta\n\\sim p(\\theta \\mid x) \\) from the true posterior is observed for each\nconditioning input, but where the neural posterior \\( q(\\theta \\mid x) \\) can\nbe sampled an arbitrary number of times. Our theoretical results establish\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for assessing distributional equality\nacross all \\( x \\), offering both rigorous guarantees and practical\nscalability. Empirically, we demonstrate that CoLT not only performs better\nthan existing methods at comparing $p$ and $q$, but also pinpoints regions of\nsignificant divergence, providing actionable insights for model refinement.\nThese properties position CoLT as a state-of-the-art solution for validating\nneural posterior estimates."}

To alleviate this problem, especially in studies based\non observational data with uncontrolled dynamic treatment and real-time\nmeasurement of many covariates, we propose abandoning the baseline hazard and\nusing machine learning to explicitly model the change in the risk set with or\nwithout latent variables. For this framework, we clarify the context in which\nhazard ratios can be causally interpreted, and then develop a method based on\nNeyman orthogonality to compute debiased maximum-likelihood estimators of\nhazard ratios. Computing the constructed estimators is more efficient than\ncomputing those based on weighted regression with marginal structural Cox\nmodels. Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed method identifies the\nground truth with minimal bias. These results lay the foundation for developing\na useful, alternative method for causal inference with uncontrolled,\nobservational data in modern epidemiology."}

ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technology\n  (IMWUT)", "summary": "Mindfulness training is widely recognized for its benefits in reducing\ndepression, anxiety, and loneliness. With the rise of smartphone-based\nmindfulness apps, digital meditation has become more accessible, but sustaining\nlong-term user engagement remains a challenge. This paper explores whether\nrespiration biosignal feedback and mindfulness skill estimation enhance system\nusability and skill development. We develop a smartphone's accelerometer-based\nrespiration tracking algorithm, eliminating the need for additional wearables.\nUnlike existing methods, our approach accurately captures slow breathing\npatterns typical of mindfulness meditation. Additionally, we introduce the\nfirst quantitative framework to estimate mindfulness skills-concentration,\nsensory clarity, and equanimity-based on accelerometer-derived respiration\ndata. We develop and test our algorithms on 261 mindfulness sessions in both\ncontrolled and real-world settings. A user study comparing an experimental\ngroup receiving biosignal feedback with a control group using a standard app\nshows that respiration feedback enhances system usability. Our respiration\ntracking model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.6 breaths per minute,\nclosely aligning with ground truth data, while our mindfulness skill estimation\nattains F1 scores of 80-84% in tracking skill progression. By integrating\nrespiration tracking and mindfulness estimation into a commercial app, we\ndemonstrate the potential of smartphone sensors to enhance digital mindfulness\ntraining."}

Particularly, Darcy flow equation is a fundamental\nequation in fluid mechanics, which plays a crucial role in understanding fluid\nflow through porous media. Bayesian methods provide an effective approach for\nsolving PDEs inverse problems, while their numerical implementation requires\nnumerous evaluations of computationally expensive forward solvers. Therefore,\nthe adoption of surrogate models with lower computational costs is essential.\nHowever, constructing a globally accurate surrogate model for high-dimensional\ncomplex problems demands high model capacity and large amounts of data. To\naddress this challenge, this study proposes an efficient locally accurate\nsurrogate that focuses on the high-probability regions of the true likelihood\nin inverse problems, with relatively low model complexity and few training data\nrequirements. Additionally, we introduce a sequential Bayesian design strategy\nto acquire the proposed surrogate since the high-probability region of the\nlikelihood is unknown. The strategy treats the posterior evolution process of\nsequential Bayesian design as a Gaussian process, enabling algorithmic\nacceleration through one-step ahead prior. The complete algorithmic framework\nis referred to as Sequential Bayesian design for locally accurate surrogate\n(SBD-LAS). Finally, three experiments based the Darcy flow equation demonstrate\nthe advantages of the proposed method in terms of both inversion accuracy and\ncomputational speed."}
