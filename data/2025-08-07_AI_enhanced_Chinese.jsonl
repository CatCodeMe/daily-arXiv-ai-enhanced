This paper is the first to introduce a sublinear-time\nalgorithm for counting squares in the packed setting. The packed representation\nof a string of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\\sigma$ is given as a\nsequence of $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$ machine words in the word-RAM model (a machine\nword consists of $\\omega \\ge \\log_2 n$ bits).

We use the techniques for\nextracting squares from runs described by Crochemore et al.

The\nlong-period runs with a string period that is periodic itself (called layer\nruns) are an obstacle, since their number can be $\\Omega(n)$. The number of all\nother long-period runs is $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$ and we can construct an implicit\nrepresentation of all long-period runs in $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$ time by\nleveraging the insights of Amir et al. [ESA 2019]. We count squares in layer\nruns by exploiting combinatorial properties of pyramidally-shaped groups of\nlayer runs. Another difficulty lies in computing the locations of Lyndon roots\nof runs in packed strings, which is needed for grouping runs that may generate\nequal squares. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce sparse-Lyndon roots\nwhich are based on string synchronizers [Kempa and Kociumaka, STOC 2019].", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u540c\u5e73\u65b9\u6570\u7684\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u538b\u7f29\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4e2d\u5e73\u65b9\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u73b0\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u957f\u5468\u671f\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u5c42\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758fLyndon\u6839\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(n/log_\u03c3 n)\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4e2d\u5e73\u65b9\u6570\u7684\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of\nreasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to\nenhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability.

To address these issues, we propose\nCX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved \"think-answer\"\nreasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and\nverifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an\ninstruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148\nsamples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points\nsupervised by clinical reports.

Due to limitations in consensus mechanisms,\nespecially in managing node identities, blockchain is often considered\nunsuitable for applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper\nproposes the Advanced DAG-based Ranking (ADR) protocol to enhance blockchain\nscalability and throughput. ADR employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\nstructure where nodes are positioned based on their rankings. Unlike\ntraditional chains, ADR allows honest nodes to write blocks and verify\ntransactions using a DAG-based topology. The protocol follows a three-step\napproach to secure the network against double-spending and enhance performance.\nFirst, it verifies nodes using their public and private keys before granting\nentry. Second, it builds an advanced DAG ledger enabling block production and\ntransaction validation. Third, a ranking algorithm filters out malicious nodes,\nranks the remaining nodes based on performance, and arranges them\ntopologically. This process increases throughput and ensures robust\nscalability. We evaluated ADR on Amazon EC2 clusters with over 100 nodes,\nincluding scenarios with injected malicious nodes.

Existing methods typically leverage either global\nlow-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers\nfrom notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and\nmay disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often\nrequire extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep)\nmodel that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker\ndecomposition. Specifically, LRTuckerRep encodes low rankness through a\nself-adaptive weighted nuclear norm on the factor matrices and a sparse Tucker\ncore, while capturing smoothness via a parameter-free Laplacian-based\nregularization on the factor spaces. To efficiently solve the resulting\nnonconvex optimization problem, we develop two iterative algorithms with\nprovable convergence guarantees.

While\nvarious approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs:\nrule-based solutions face challenges in meeting code safety and idiomaticity\nrequirements, while LLM-based solutions often fail to generate semantically\nequivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the\nentire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited\nto small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated\nframework for converting entire C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust\nemploys a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation.\nThe pipeline consists of three evolutionary stages: 1) it first decomposes the\nC project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to\ntransform definitions and macros and generates type-checked function stubs,\nwhich form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates the\nfunction, replacing the corresponding stub placeholder; 3) finally, it repairs\ncompilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary\naugmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and\nLLM-based solutions.

Despite the success of AI as a\nservice for multi-modal applications, it relies heavily on clouds, which are\nconstrained by bandwidth, latency, privacy concerns, and unavailability under\nnetwork or server failures. While on-device AI becomes popular, supporting\nmultiple tasks on edge devices imposes significant resource challenges. To\naddress this, we introduce S2M3, a split-and-share multi-modal architecture for\nmulti-task inference on edge devices. Inspired by the general-purpose nature of\nmulti-modal models, which are composed of multiple modules (encoder, decoder,\nclassifier, etc.), we propose to split multi-modal models at functional-level\nmodules; and then share common modules to reuse them across tasks, thereby\nreducing resource usage. To address cross-model dependency arising from module\nsharing, we propose a greedy module-level placement with per-request parallel\nrouting by prioritizing compute-intensive modules. Through experiments on a\ntestbed consisting of 14 multi-modal models across 5 tasks and 10 benchmarks,\nwe demonstrate that S2M3 can reduce memory usage by up to 50% and 62% in\nsingle-task and multi-task settings, respectively, without sacrificing\naccuracy.

Traditional numerical solvers offer high accuracy, but suffer from\nscalability issues and substantial computational costs. Pure data-driven deep\nlearning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding\nduring training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their\napplicability and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nU-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully\ndeep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational\nEM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational\nefficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers\nand the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the\ndecomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a\nmultiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a\nphysics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self-\nand mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D)\nobjects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering\nmodeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency.\nExperimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface\ncurrent distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while\nsignificantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep\nlearning baselines in both accuracy and robustness.

LLMs'\nadvantage originates from superior recall, confirming an ability to reason\nacross broader code contexts. However, this benefit comes with substantial\ntrade-offs: DeepSeek V3 exhibits the highest false-positive ratio, all language\nmodels mislocate issues at line-or-column granularity due to tokenisation\nartefacts. Overall, language models successfully rival traditional static\nanalysers in finding real vulnerabilities. Still, their noisier output and\nimprecise localisation limit their standalone use in safety-critical audits. We\ntherefore recommend a hybrid pipeline: employ language models early in\ndevelopment for broad, context-aware triage, while reserving deterministic\nrule-based scanners for high-assurance verification.

Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains\nchallenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a\ncomplex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of\nsoil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts\nagricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate\nresilience. In this work, we propose $\\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal\nmultitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized\npipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first\npredict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.\nEach segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological\nfeatures. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal\nconcatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to\naccount for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons.

As bandit algorithms\nare increasingly deployed in these socially sensitive settings, it becomes\ncritical to protect user data privacy and ensure fair treatment across decision\nrounds. While prior work has independently addressed privacy and fairness in\nbandit settings, the question of whether both objectives can be achieved\nsimultaneously has remained largely open. Existing privacy-preserving bandit\nalgorithms typically optimize average regret, a utilitarian measure, whereas\nfairness-aware approaches focus on minimizing Nash regret, which penalizes\ninequitable reward distributions, but often disregard privacy concerns.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound\n(DP-NCB)-a novel and unified algorithmic framework that simultaneously ensures\n$\\epsilon$-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret,\nmatching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors.

We propose a combined manifold and machine\nlearning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent\ncrowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The\nproposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation\nEquation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and\nmultiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the\nmass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first\nstep, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete\nmicroscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based\non manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space\ninto the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the\ncorresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning\nreduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning\ntechniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the\ncrowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density\nprofiles.

In these domains,\nfairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a\ncommon challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade\nAUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional\nOptimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework\nthat strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups\nusing optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable\nproportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged\ngroup.

Furthermore,\nwe extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions\nto concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic,\npublic, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms\nexisting post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios,\noften achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive\ngains in utility.

This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement\nUnit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously\ncollect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user\nbehaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor\ndata, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large\nquantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user\nagency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable,\nfew-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework.

Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas\nnegative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be\nexplicitly forgotten. Overall, the token categorization facilitate the model to\nlearn less informative message, and the forgetting process shapes a knowledge\nboundary to guide the model on what information to learn more precisely.

Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we\nexamine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model\narchitecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation\nmethodologies. Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are\nconcentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based\ntechniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these\nmethods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between\nmodalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity\nacross domains. Importantly, we find that evaluation methods for XAI in\nmultimodal settings are largely non-systematic, lacking consistency,\nrobustness, and consideration for modality-specific cognitive and contextual\nfactors. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of\nrecommendations aimed at promoting rigorous, transparent, and standardized\nevaluation and reporting practices in multimodal XAI research.

The results\nshow that our approach effectively answers the core question: Can the\ndisclosure of a given identity attribute possibly lead to the disclosure of\nanother attribute?", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67905000\u591a\u4e2a\u8eab\u4efd\u76d7\u7a83\u548c\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u4eba\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u4f7f\u5f97\u4e2a\u4eba\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8eab\u4efd\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u8bba\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5f00\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u6548\u56de\u7b54\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u67d0\u4e2a\u8eab\u4efd\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u62ab\u9732\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u62ab\u9732\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

A major challenge is the integration of real-world data\ninto the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we\nintroduce two novel training strategies.

In this\npaper, we leverage causal tools and introduce a new causality-based framework,\nCaPulse, which tunes in to the underlying causal pulse of time series data to\neffectively detect anomalies.

While\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced LP performance\nrecently, existing methods face key challenges including limited supervision\nfrom sparse connectivity, sensitivity to initialization, and poor\ngeneralization under distribution shifts. We explore pretraining as a solution\nto address these challenges. Unlike node classification, LP is inherently a\npairwise task, which requires the integration of both node- and edge-level\ninformation. In this work, we present the first systematic study on the\ntransferability of these distinct modules and propose a late fusion strategy to\neffectively combine their outputs for improved performance. To handle the\ndiversity of pretraining data and avoid negative transfer, we introduce a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that captures distinct patterns in separate\nexperts, facilitating seamless application of the pretrained model on diverse\ndownstream datasets.

Early, accurate detection is essential to prevent\ncardiovascular complications, yet current monitoring methods are either\ninvasive or rely on subjective symptom reporting, limiting applicability in\ndaily file. This study presents a non-invasive, explainable machine learning\nframework for detecting AD using multimodal wearable sensors. Data were\ncollected from 27 individuals with chronic SCI during urodynamic studies,\nincluding electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), bioimpedance\n(BioZ), temperature, respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR), across three\ncommercial devices. Objective AD labels were derived from synchronized\ncuff-based BP measurements. Following signal preprocessing and feature\nextraction, BorutaSHAP was used for robust feature selection, and SHAP values\nfor explainability. We trained modality- and device-specific weak learners and\naggregated them using a stacked ensemble meta-model. Cross-validation was\nstratified by participants to ensure generalizability. HR- and ECG-derived\nfeatures were identified as the most informative, particularly those capturing\nrhythm morphology and variability. The Nearest Centroid ensemble yielded the\nhighest performance (Macro F1 = 0.77+/-0.03), significantly outperforming\nbaseline models. Among modalities, HR achieved the highest area under the curve\n(AUC = 0.93), followed by ECG (0.88) and PPG (0.86). RR and temperature\nfeatures contributed less to overall accuracy, consistent with missing data and\nlow specificity. The model proved robust to sensor dropout and aligned well\nwith clinical AD events.

However, aligning\nmedical images with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reports with a high\nSNR presents a semantic density gap, leading to visual alignment bias. In this\npaper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment\neffectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level\nvision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to\ndifferentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical\nstructure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling\nmethod to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging\nVQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This\nprocess amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in\nabnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of\nabnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures\nthe diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate\nalignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two\nchest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset,\nMedVL-CT69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across\nmultiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Notably, our method achieved an average\nAUC of 84.9% across 54 diseases in 15 organs, significantly surpassing existing\nmethods.

This involves creating a separate legal framework for AI\nsystems, with rules and regulations translated into a machine-readable,\nalgorithmic format to avoid the ambiguity of natural language. The paper\nemphasises the need for a \"dedicated operational context\" for autonomous AI\nsystems, analogous to the \"operational design domain\" for autonomous vehicles.\nThis means creating a specific, clearly defined environment and set of rules\nwithin which the AI can operate safely and effectively. The model advocates for\ntraining AI systems on controlled, synthetically generated data to ensure\nfairness and ethical considerations are embedded from the start. Game theory is\nalso proposed as a method for calculating the optimal strategy for the AI to\nachieve its goals within these ethical and legal constraints. The provided\nanalysis highlights the importance of explainable AI (XAI) to ensure the\ntransparency and accountability of decisions made by autonomous systems. This\nis crucial for building trust and for complying with the \"right to\nexplanation\".", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u4ece\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u5177\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fddAI\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u6cd5\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u8fdc\u8d85\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u6307\u5357\u7684\u5236\u5b9a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4AI\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u4e13\u7528\u64cd\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u786e\u4fddAI\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u8c03\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\uff08XAI\uff09\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u4e3aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u7acb\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002"}}

A promising avenue of inquiry in the\nmeanwhile is to seek practical advantages through hybrid quantum-classical\nalgorithms, which combine conventional neural networks with variational quantum\ncircuits (VQCs) running on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)\nhardware. Such hybrids are well suited to NISQ hardware. The classical\nprocessor performs the bulk of the computation, while the quantum processor\nexecutes targeted sub-tasks that supply additional non-linearity and\nexpressivity. Here, we benchmark a purely classical E(3)-equivariant\nmessage-passing machine learning potential (MLP) against a hybrid\nquantum-classical MLP for predicting density functional theory (DFT) properties\nof liquid silicon.

However,\nenabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major\nchallenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are\nparticularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal\ncontinual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal\nfeature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and\nzero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and\nsystematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by\nidentifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.\nBased on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to\ntheir target problems: (1) \\textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address\ncross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)\n\\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during\nupdates; and (3) \\textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter\ninterference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current\nevaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better\nbenchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional\ngeneralization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions,\nincluding continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning.

However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time\nseries remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality\ngap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time\nseries; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB\nthree-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with\narbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between\nthe deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for\nuncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose\nVisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on\nlarge-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a\nvision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series\ndata, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2)\na colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time\nseries into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate\ndependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel\nreconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus\nmore flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive\nprior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \\model achieves SOTA results, outperforming\nspecialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12\nprobabilistic forecasting settings.

Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that\ngradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from\nshallow to deep layers.

While\neffective, it remains unclear whether their gains stem from true multimodal\nunderstanding or increased model complexity. This work investigates the role of\nmultimodal item embeddings, emphasizing the semantic informativeness of the\nrepresentations. Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard\nextractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on\nmodality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over\ncross-modal alignment. To overcome these limitations, we leverage Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via\nstructured prompts. This approach yields semantically aligned representations\nwithout requiring any fusion. Experiments across multiple settings show notable\nperformance improvements. Furthermore, LVLMs embeddings offer a distinctive\nadvantage: they can be decoded into structured textual descriptions, enabling\ndirect assessment of their multimodal comprehension. When such descriptions are\nincorporated as side content into recommender systems, they improve\nrecommendation performance, empirically validating the semantic depth and\nalignment encoded within LVLMs outputs.

Although most existing methods address only one of\nthese challenges, we introduce the Accept-Reject Lasso (ARL), a novel approach\nthat resolves this dilemma. ARL operationalizes an Accept-Reject framework\nthrough a fine-grained analysis of feature selection across data subsets. This\nframework is designed to partition the output of an ensemble method into\nbeneficial and detrimental components through fine-grained analysis. The\nfundamental challenge for Lasso is that inter-variable correlation obscures the\ntrue sources of information. ARL tackles this by first using clustering to\nidentify distinct subset structures within the data. It then analyzes Lasso's\nbehavior across these subsets to differentiate between true and spurious\ncorrelations. For truly correlated features, which induce multicollinearity,\nARL tends to select a single representative feature and reject the rest to\nensure model stability. Conversely, for features linked by spurious\ncorrelations, which may vanish in certain subsets, ARL accepts those that Lasso\nmight have incorrectly omitted. The distinct patterns arising from true versus\nspurious correlations create a divisible separation.

However, continual fine-tuning\nLLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,\ncharacterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and\n2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously\naddress both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample\nReplay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient\nanti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices\nunder GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced\nactivation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin\n(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.\nWe are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general\nreplay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general\ncapabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.\nIndeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled\nexperiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies\nunder the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via\nKL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that\nTM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work\npaves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future.

However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,\nparticularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,\nwe propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to\nautonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.\nSpecifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel\nsoftware environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new\nsoftware, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle\nauto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we\ndesign a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a\nCurriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.\nThe agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of\nadversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist\ntraining strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from\nspecialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA\ncapable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately\nachieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on\ntheir specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across\nfive novel software environments within OS-World.
