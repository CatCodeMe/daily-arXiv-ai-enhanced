### [1] [SimBank: from Simulation to Solution in Prescriptive Process Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14772)
*Jakob De Moor,Hans Weytjens,Johannes De Smedt,Jochen De Weerdt*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SimBank，一个用于精准基准测试PresPM方法的模拟器，解决了现有文献中技术比较不足和评估方法不充分的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PresPM领域缺乏技术间的广泛比较和有效的评估方法，SimBank旨在填补这些空白。

Method: SimBank基于银行贷款申请流程设计，支持在线和离线PresPM方法的比较，包含多种干预优化问题，并模拟真实流程实例。

Result: SimBank能够生成每种干预下的真实结果，支持因果机器学习挑战的实验，并通过概念验证展示了其基准测试能力。

Conclusion: SimBank作为公开可用的模拟器，对推动PresPM研究和实践具有重要价值。

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is an emerging area within Process
Mining, focused on optimizing processes through real-time interventions for
effective decision-making. PresPM holds significant promise for organizations
seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces
two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and
insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce
SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods.
Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive
comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a
variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of
complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges,
such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank
additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case,
it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not
possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel
activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely
resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates
SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM
methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly
available simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM.

### [2] [Efficient Serving of LLM Applications with Probabilistic Demand Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14851)
*Yifei Liu,Zuo Gan,Zhenghao Gan,Weiye Wang,Chen Chen,Yizhou Shan,Xusheng Chen,Zhenhua Han,Yifei Zhu,Shixuan Sun,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于概率需求图（PDGraph）的LLM应用服务系统Hermes，通过优化调度顺序和预热后端，显著提升了服务效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将LLM应用的资源需求视为黑箱，导致端到端效率低下。

Method: 利用PDGraph建模资源需求，应用Gittins策略优化调度顺序，并适时预热后端。

Result: 实验表明，Hermes将平均完成时间减少70%以上，P95完成时间减少80%以上。

Conclusion: Hermes通过精准建模和优化调度，显著提升了LLM应用的效率。

Abstract: Applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs) contains a series of tasks
to address real-world problems with boosted capability, which have dynamic
demand volumes on diverse backends. Existing serving systems treat the resource
demands of LLM applications as a blackbox, compromising end-to-end efficiency
due to improper queuing order and backend warm up latency. We find that the
resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate
manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which
leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications. Confronting
probabilistic demand description, Hermes applies the Gittins policy to
determine the scheduling order that can minimize the average application
completion time. It also uses the PDGraph model to help prewarm cold backends
at proper moments. Experiments with diverse LLM applications confirm that
Hermes can effectively improve the application serving efficiency, reducing the
average completion time by over 70% and the P95 completion time by over 80%.

*Qizheng Zhang,Michael Wornow,Kunle Olukotun*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的代理应用缓存方法，通过提取、存储和重用结构化计划模板，显著降低了服务成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM缓存技术（如上下文缓存和语义缓存）主要针对聊天机器人设计，无法满足依赖外部数据或环境上下文的代理应用需求。

Method: 提出代理计划缓存方法，从已完成代理执行中提取计划模板，通过关键词匹配和轻量模型适配新任务。

Result: 在多个实际代理应用中，系统平均降低成本46.62%，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM代理服务提供了高效解决方案，可与现有基础设施互补。

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable
capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive
planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like
context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,
are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data
or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach
that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from
planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to
reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system
extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs
keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes
lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with
contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that
our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,
offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that
complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，显著降低计算成本，适合云环境。

Abstract: Data analysis on massive multi-dimensional data, such as high-resolution
large-region time averaging or area averaging for geospatial data, often
involves calculations over a significant number of data points. While
performing calculations in scalable and flexible distributed or cloud
environments is a viable option, a full scan of large data volumes still serves
as a computationally intensive bottleneck, leading to significant cost. This
paper introduces a generic and comprehensive method to address these
computational challenges. This method generates a small, size-tunable
supplementary dataset that stores the cumulative sums along specific subset
dimensions on top of the raw data. This minor addition unlocks rapid and cheap
high-resolution large-region data analysis, making calculations over large
numbers of data points feasible with small instances or even microservices in
the cloud. This method is general-purpose, but is particularly well-suited for
data stored in chunked, cloud-optimized formats and for services running in
distributed or cloud environments. We present a Zarr extension proposal to
integrate the specifications of this method and facilitate its straightforward
implementation in general-purpose software applications. Benchmark tests
demonstrate that this method, implemented in Amazon Web services (AWS),
significantly outperforms the brute-force approach used in on-premises
services. With just 5% supplemental storage, this method achieves a performance
that is 3-4 orders of magnitude (~10,000 times) faster than the brute-force
approach, while incurring significantly reduced computational costs.

*Youjia Li,Robert Latham,Robert Ross,Ankit Agrawal,Alok Choudhary,Wei-Keng Liao*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的文件头格式，解决了高并行环境下独立创建数据对象的性能问题，显著提升了I/O效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高并行I/O库（如HDF5和PnetCDF）在创建大量数据对象时效率低下，尤其是在需要独立创建不同数据对象的场景中。

Method: 基于PnetCDF实验平台，提出了一种新的文件头格式，包含索引表和元数据块，支持独立或集体创建数据对象。

Result: 新设计在4096个MPI进程中创建5,684,800个数据对象时，性能提升高达582倍，并显著降低了内存占用。

Conclusion: 新方法解决了高并行I/O中的性能瓶颈，适用于需要高效独立创建数据对象的科学应用。

Abstract: High-level I/O libraries, such as HDF5 and PnetCDF, are commonly used by
large-scale scientific applications to perform I/O tasks in parallel. These I/O
libraries store the metadata such as data types and dimensionality along with
the raw data in the same files. While these libraries are well-optimized for
concurrent access to the raw data, they are designed neither to handle a large
number of data objects efficiently nor to create different data objects
independently by multiple processes, as they require applications to call data
object creation APIs collectively with consistent metadata among all processes.
Applications that process data gathered from remote sensors, such as particle
collision experiments in high-energy physics, may generate data of different
sizes from different sensors and desire to store them as separate data objects.
For such applications, the I/O library's requirement on collective data object
creation can become very expensive, as the cost of metadata consistency check
increases with the metadata volume as well as the number of processes. To
address this limitation, using PnetCDF as an experimental platform, we
investigate solutions in this paper that abide the netCDF file format, as well
as propose a new file header format that enables independent data object
creation. The proposed file header consists of two sections, an index table and
a list of metadata blocks. The index table contains the reference to the
metadata blocks and each block stores metadata of objects that can be created
collectively or independently. The new design achieves a scalable performance,
cutting data object creation times by up to 582x when running on 4096 MPI
processes to create 5,684,800 data objects in parallel. Additionally, the new
method reduces the memory footprints, with each process requiring an amount of
memory space inversely proportional to the number of processes.

### [6] [eLLM: Elastic Memory Management Framework for Efficient LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15155)
*Jiale Xu,Rui Zhang,Yi Xiong,Cong Guo,Zihan Liu,Yangjie Zhou,Weiming Hu,Hao Wu,Changxu Shao,Ziqing Wang,Yongjie Yuan,Junping Zhao,Minyi Guo,Jingwen Leng*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: eLLM提出了一种弹性内存管理框架，通过虚拟张量抽象和动态内存调整，显著提升了大型语言模型的内存利用率和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统在内存管理上采用双层次抽象，导致运行时内存与KV缓存管理隔离，内存利用率低，吞吐量下降近20%。

Method: eLLM包含虚拟张量抽象、弹性内存机制和轻量级调度策略，动态调整内存分配并优化性能。

Result: eLLM比现有系统解码吞吐量高2.32倍，支持128K-token输入的批量大小提升3倍。

Conclusion: eLLM通过统一内存管理和动态调整，显著提升了LLM服务的内存效率和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly being deployed in datacenters. Serving
these models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes
static weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights
are constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV
caches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for
efficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle
runtime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory
management relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a
page table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction.
This virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory
fragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime
memory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization
under dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.
  To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management
framework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating
systems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction,
which decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU
memory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory
Mechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory
inflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3)
a Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize
memory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under
stringent SLO constraints. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that eLLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, 2.32x higher decoding
throughput, and supporting 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文探讨了将Cooley-Tukey FFT算法移植到基于RISC-V的Tenstorrent Wormhole PCIe加速器上的性能表现，发现其虽慢于高端CPU，但功耗和能耗显著更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RISC-V在HPC领域尚未普及，但其加速器可能通过开放标准提供专业化优势，同时避免大规模生态系统变更。

Method: 将FFT算法移植到Tenstorrent Wormhole加速器，并优化数据移动瓶颈。

Result: Wormhole加速器在2D FFT中性能低于24核Xeon Platinum CPU，但功耗和能耗分别降低8倍和2.8倍。

Conclusion: RISC-V加速器在能效方面具有潜力，适合对功耗敏感的应用。

Abstract: Whilst numerous areas of computing have adopted the RISC-V Instruction Set
Architecture (ISA) wholesale in recent years, it is yet to become widespread in
HPC. RISC-V accelerators offer a compelling option where the HPC community can
benefit from the specialisation offered by the open nature of the standard but
without the extensive ecosystem changes required when adopting RISC-V CPUs. In
this paper we explore porting the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
algorithm to the Tenstorrent Wormhole PCIe RISC-V based accelerator. Built upon
Tenstorrent's Tensix architecture, this technology decouples the movement of
data from compute, potentially offering increased control to the programmer.
Exploring different optimisation techniques to address the bottlenecks inherent
in data movement, we demonstrate that for a 2D FFT whilst the Wormhole n300 is
slower than a server-grade 24-core Xeon Platinum CPU, the Wormhole draws around
8 times less power and consumes around 2.8 times less energy than the CPU when
computing the Fourier transform.

Result: MPI在分布式内存环境中表现优异，但面临通信开销；OpenMP在共享内存系统中性能良好，但受限于内存争用；CUDA在GPU数据并行任务中性能突出，但仅适用于NVIDIA GPU。混合模型在异构环境中通常表现最佳。

Conclusion: 最佳编程模型的选择取决于应用需求、硬件和开发限制，混合模型在异构环境中具有显著优势。本文还探讨了优化实践和新兴趋势。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of three dominant parallel
programming models in High Performance Computing (HPC): Message Passing
Interface (MPI), Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP), and Compute Unified Device
Architecture (CUDA). Selecting optimal programming approaches for modern
heterogeneous HPC architectures has become increasingly critical. We
systematically analyze these models across multiple dimensions: architectural
foundations, performance characteristics, domain-specific suitability,
programming complexity, and recent advancements. We examine each model's
strengths, weaknesses, and optimization techniques. Our investigation
demonstrates that MPI excels in distributed memory environments with
near-linear scalability for communication-intensive applications, but faces
communication overhead challenges. OpenMP provides strong performance and
usability in shared-memory systems and loop-centric tasks, though it is limited
by shared memory contention. CUDA offers substantial performance gains for
data-parallel GPU workloads, but is restricted to NVIDIA GPUs and requires
specialized expertise. Performance evaluations across scientific simulations,
machine learning, and data analytics reveal that hybrid approaches combining
two or more models often yield optimal results in heterogeneous environments.
The paper also discusses implementation challenges, optimization best
practices, and emerging trends such as performance portability frameworks,
task-based programming, and the convergence of HPC and Big Data. This research
helps developers and researchers make informed decisions when selecting
programming models for modern HPC applications, emphasizing that the best
choice depends on application requirements, hardware, and development
constraints.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CheckFree和CheckFree+是高效恢复方法，通过加权平均邻近阶段或无序流水线执行来替代故障阶段，减少计算和存储开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分散计算节点上训练LLMs时，节点故障会导致阶段丢失，传统恢复方法（如检查点和冗余计算）开销大且扩展性差。

Method: CheckFree用邻近阶段的加权平均替代故障阶段；CheckFree+通过无序流水线执行和复制权重恢复首尾阶段故障。

Result: 在低至中等故障率下，CheckFree和CheckFree+在收敛时间上优于传统方法12%以上。

Conclusion: CheckFree和CheckFree+提供了一种高效、低开销的故障恢复方案，适用于大规模模型训练。

Abstract: Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple
on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization.
The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the
operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the
model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use
checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an
additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield
significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases
and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,
CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by
a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state
of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,
because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover
failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+
with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last
stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is
mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by
simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover
the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring
stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively
evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with
varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates
(5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant
computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our
proposals can be run via our code available at:
https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

Result: 证明了通信下界的紧性，并展示了最优算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 为对称张量的并行计算提供了理论支持和实用方法。

Abstract: In this article, we focus on the parallel communication cost of multiplying
the same vector along two modes of a $3$-dimensional symmetric tensor. This is
a key computation in the higher-order power method for determining eigenpairs
of a $3$-dimensional symmetric tensor and in gradient-based methods for
computing a symmetric CP decomposition. We establish communication lower bounds
that determine how much data movement is required to perform the specified
computation in parallel. The core idea of the proof relies on extending a key
geometric inequality for $3$-dimensional symmetric computations. We demonstrate
that the communication lower bounds are tight by presenting an optimal
algorithm where the data distribution is a natural extension of the triangle
block partition scheme for symmetric matrices to 3-dimensional symmetric
tensors.

Abstract: Parallel computing with multiple GPUs has become the dominant paradigm for
machine learning tasks, especially those of large language models (LLMs). To
reduce the latency incurred by inter-GPU communication, a common practice for
parallel tasks has been to allocate GPUs based on their physical proximity.
However, this long-standing assumption has notable limitations, particularly in
large-scale, heterogeneous GPU clusters where bandwidth distribution among GPUs
is irregular. In this paper, we introduce LiteGD, a lightweight and dynamic GPU
dispatching system based on global perspectives. To tackle the difficulty of
storing massive GPU topology information, LiteGD adopts a computation-aware
design that leverages a lightweight Transformer network trained on sampled
data. Our customized design for network structure ensures both transferability
and scalability. LiteGD also employs a bidirectional tree search approach to
find the optimal GPU dispatching in the data generated in the previous step,
which can identify near-optimal solutions while reducing search overhead. We
implement and evaluate LiteGD in both real and simulated GPU clusters with
homogeneous and heterogeneous interconnects, respectively. Experimental results
demonstrate that LiteGD consistently achieves high GPU bandwidth efficacy
(approximately 90\%) across various cluster configurations and 80\% in
real-world H100 cluster, significantly outperforming conventional default and
interconnect topology-aware dispatching methods, particularly in large-scale
heterogeneous environments.

Result: 在有限亏格图和H-无小图中实现了确定性并行DFS，有限树宽图的复杂度提升至Logspace。

Conclusion: 研究推进了确定性并行DFS算法的边界，但仍需进一步解决一般图的挑战。

Abstract: Constructing a Depth First Search (DFS) tree is a fundamental graph problem,
whose parallel complexity is still not settled. Reif showed parallel
intractability of lex-first DFS. In contrast, randomized parallel algorithms
(and more recently, deterministic quasipolynomial parallel algorithms) are
known for constructing a DFS tree in general (di)graphs. However a
deterministic parallel algorithm for DFS in general graphs remains an elusive
goal. Working towards this, a series of works gave deterministic NC algorithms
for DFS in planar graphs and digraphs. We further extend these results to more
general graph classes, by providing NC algorithms for (di)graphs of bounded
genus, and for undirected H-minor-free graphs where H is a fixed graph with at
most one crossing. For the case of (di)graphs of bounded tree-width, we further
improve the complexity to a Logspace bound. Constructing a maximal path is a
simpler problem (that reduces to DFS) for which no deterministic parallel
bounds are known for general graphs. For planar graphs a bound of O(log n)
parallel time on a CREW PRAM (thus in NC2) is known. We improve this bound to
Logspace.

### [15] [Efficient space reduction techniques by optimized majority rules for the Kemeny aggregation problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15097)
*Xuan Kien Phung,Sylvie Hamel*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文针对Kemeny聚合问题的计算复杂性高的问题，提出了优化的定量扩展方法，改进了空间缩减技术，实验结果显示效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kemeny聚合问题在多个领域有重要应用，但其计算复杂性高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过利用问题中的额外信息（如候选人数）和优化单变量分段线性函数，改进了3/4多数规则和Major Order Theorem。

Result: 实验结果表明，新方法在真实和合成数据上显著提升了空间缩减效果，且未增加时间复杂度。

Conclusion: 本文提出的优化方法为Kemeny聚合问题提供了更高效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The Kemeny aggregation problem consists of computing the consensus rankings
of an election with respect to the Kemeny-Young voting method. These aggregated
rankings are the geometric medians as well as the maximum likelihood estimators
in the Mallows model of the rankings in the election under the Kendall-tau
distance which counts the number of pairwise disagreements. The problem admits
fundamental applications in various domains such as computational social
choice, machine learning, operations research, and biology but its
computational complexity is unfortunately expensive. In this paper, we
establish optimized quantitative extensions of the well-known 3/4-majority rule
of Betzler et al. and the Major Order Theorem of Hamel and Milosz for the
Kemeny aggregation problem. By taking into account the extra information
available in the problem such as the number of candidates and by considering an
additional optimization of certain piecewise linear functions in one variable,
our results achieve significantly more refined space reduction techniques as
illustrated by experimental results on real and synthetic data without
increasing the time complexity of the algorithms.

*Thomas Kuntz,Agatha Duzan,Hao Zhao,Francesco Croce,Zico Kolter,Nicolas Flammarion,Maksym Andriushchenko*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文介绍了OS-Harm基准测试，用于评估基于LLM的计算机使用代理的安全性，覆盖用户滥用、提示注入攻击和模型不当行为三类危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于LLM的计算机代理系统日益流行，但其安全性问题尚未得到充分研究，阻碍了广泛应用。

Method: 通过OSWorld环境构建OS-Harm基准，包含150个任务，测试代理在多种安全违规场景下的表现，并开发自动化评估工具。

Result: 测试显示，前沿模型（如o4-mini、Claude 3.7 Sonnet等）易受滥用和提示注入攻击，且偶尔会执行不安全操作。

Conclusion: OS-Harm为评估计算机代理安全性提供了标准化工具，揭示了当前模型的安全隐患，呼吁进一步改进。

Abstract: Computer use agents are LLM-based agents that can directly interact with a
graphical user interface, by processing screenshots or accessibility trees.
While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely
overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential
for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap,
we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use
agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test
models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt
injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150
tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright
infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to
interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser,
etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and
safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and
0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier
models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide
insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply
with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt
injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions. The OS-Harm benchmark is
available at https://github.com/tml-epfl/os-harm.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究首次全面分析了数据可视化库中的错误，收集了五个广泛使用的库中的564个错误，系统分析了其症状和根本原因，并提出了一种详细的分类法。研究发现，不正确/不准确的绘图在数据可视化库中普遍存在，主要原因是图形计算错误，需要进一步开发自动化测试方法。此外，研究还提出了触发此类错误的八个关键步骤和两个特定于数据可视化的测试预言，并探索了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在检测错误绘图中的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据可视化库的准确性对用户决策至关重要，但其错误可能导致误导性信息传递和错误决策。目前缺乏对数据可视化库错误的系统性研究，因此需要深入分析这些错误的特征，以帮助开发更有效的测试方法。

Method: 研究收集了五个广泛使用的数据可视化库中的564个错误，系统分析了其症状和根本原因，并提出了一种分类法。此外，还探索了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在检测错误绘图中的可行性。

Result: 研究发现不正确/不准确的绘图在数据可视化库中普遍存在，主要原因是图形计算错误。视觉语言模型（VLMs）在检测错误绘图中的有效性为29%至57%，且提示信息的增加并不一定能提高检测效果。

Conclusion: 该研究为数据可视化库的错误分析提供了系统性框架，并提出了未来自动化测试技术的研究方向，包括利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）进行错误检测。

Abstract: Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation,
data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of
their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect
visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information
conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual
bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause
obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data
graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good
understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is
essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz
libraries.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz
libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our
study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a
detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in
DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,
which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.
Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test
oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in
designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent
advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of
applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show
that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%,
depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not
necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our
manuscript.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模糊测试评估通常关注整体性能，而忽略了细粒度程序特征对测试效果的影响。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析25项灰盒模糊测试研究，提取了7个与控制和数据流相关的程序特征，生成了包含153个程序的基准测试集，并评估了11种流行模糊测试工具。

Result: 结果显示，模糊测试工具的性能受程序特征及其强度显著影响，强调了在评估中考虑程序特性的重要性。

Conclusion: 该研究为模糊测试评估提供了更细粒度的基准测试方法，有助于更全面地理解工具性能。

Abstract: Fuzzing is a powerful software testing technique renowned for its
effectiveness in identifying software vulnerabilities. Traditional fuzzing
evaluations typically focus on overall fuzzer performance across a set of
target programs, yet few benchmarks consider how fine-grained program features
influence fuzzing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
benchmark designed to generate programs with configurable, fine-grained program
features to enhance fuzzing evaluations. We reviewed 25 recent grey-box fuzzing
studies, extracting 7 program features related to control-flow and data-flow
that can impact fuzzer performance. Using these features, we generated a
benchmark consisting of 153 programs controlled by 10 fine-grained configurable
parameters. We evaluated 11 popular fuzzers using this benchmark. The results
indicate that fuzzer performance varies significantly based on the program
features and their strengths, highlighting the importance of incorporating
program characteristics into fuzzing evaluations.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了利用大语言模型（LLM）自动预测增强报告（ERs）的批准情况，发现LLM在准确性和召回率上优于传统方法，并探讨了引入创建者资料和微调对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动处理增强报告耗时且易丢失有价值信息，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 系统评估了18种LLM变体（包括编码器和解码器模型）与传统方法（如CNN/LSTM-BERT/GloVe）的性能。

Result: LLM显著优于传统方法，微调后的Llama 3.1 8B Instruct达到79%准确率，召回率提升至76.1%。

Conclusion: LLM是增强报告批准预测的优越解决方案，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Enhancement reports (ERs) serve as a critical communication channel between
users and developers, capturing valuable suggestions for software improvement.
However, manually processing these reports is resource-intensive, leading to
delays and potential loss of valuable insights. To address this challenge,
enhancement report approval prediction (ERAP) has emerged as a research focus,
leveraging machine learning techniques to automate decision-making. While
traditional approaches have employed feature-based classifiers and deep
learning models, recent advancements in large language models (LLM) present new
opportunities for enhancing prediction accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates 18 LLM variants (including BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3, ELECTRA, and
XLNet for encoder models; GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.1
8B Instruct and DeepSeek-V3 for decoder models) against traditional methods
(CNN/LSTM-BERT/GloVe). Our experiments reveal two key insights: (1)
Incorporating creator profiles increases unfine-tuned decoder-only models'
overall accuracy by 10.8 percent though it may introduce bias; (2) LoRA
fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct further improve performance, reaching 79
percent accuracy and significantly enhancing recall for approved reports (76.1
percent vs. LSTM-GLOVE's 64.1 percent), outperforming traditional methods by 5
percent under strict chronological evaluation and effectively addressing class
imbalance issues. These findings establish LLM as a superior solution for ERAP,
demonstrating their potential to streamline software maintenance workflows and
improve decision-making in real-world development environments. We also
investigated and summarized the ER cases where the large models underperformed,
providing valuable directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式系统中的程序员需要处理并发问题以避免竞争，但并发推理困难且易出现意外竞争。通信竞争类似于数据竞争，会导致接收者收到错误消息或未收到消息。

Method: 通过扩展happens-before顺序到缓冲和非缓冲通道，静态分析分布式程序的执行。

Result: 验证框架能够证明使用消息传递同步的Go子集程序的通信竞争缺失。

Conclusion: 该框架为分布式程序提供了一种静态验证通信竞争的方法，有助于减少并发错误。

Abstract: Programmers of distributed systems need to reason about concurrency to avoid
races. However, reasoning about concurrency is difficult, and unexpected races
show up as bugs. Data race detection in shared memory systems is well-studied
(dynamic data race detection [13], behavioral types [15], dynamic race
detection [31]). Similar to how a data race consists of reads and writes not
related by happens-before at a shared memory location, a communication race
consists of receives and sends not related by happens-before on a shared
channel. Communication races are problematic: a receiver expects a specific
message from a specific sender, but with a communication race, the receiver can
receive a message meant for another receiver, or not receive anything at all.
In this work, we describe a verification framework that can prove the absence
of communication races for distributed programs that use a subset of the Go
programming language, where synchronization is mainly achieved via message
passing. We statically reason about how a distributed program executes, using a
happens-before order, extended to buffered and unbuffered channels.

Abstract: Unit testing is a fundamental practice in modern software engineering, with
the aim of ensuring the correctness, maintainability, and reliability of
individual software components. Very recently, with the advances in Large
Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly growing body of research has leveraged LLMs
to automate various unit testing tasks, demonstrating remarkable performance
and significantly reducing manual effort. However, due to ongoing explorations
in the LLM-based unit testing field, it is challenging for researchers to
understand existing achievements, open challenges, and future opportunities.
This paper presents the first systematic literature review on the application
of LLMs in unit testing until March 2025. We analyze \numpaper{} relevant
papers from the perspectives of both unit testing and LLMs. We first categorize
existing unit testing tasks that benefit from LLMs, e.g., test generation and
oracle generation. We then discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs
into unit testing research, including model usage, adaptation strategies, and
hybrid approaches. We further summarize key challenges that remain unresolved
and outline promising directions to guide future research in this area.
Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to
the unit testing community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive
understanding of achievements and promote future research. Our artifacts are

TL;DR: 研究探讨了开发者常用的代码片段描述类型，并评估了Llama模型在生成描述时的表现。基于NPM代码片段数据集，研究发现多数描述为示例用途，LLM能较好识别此类描述，但生成的描述仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的兴起，研究旨在了解开发者常用的代码片段描述类型，并评估LLM（如Llama）在生成描述时的能力。

Method: 使用NPM代码片段数据集（185,412个包，1,024,579个片段），从中选取400个片段及其描述作为样本。手动分类描述类型，并评估LLM生成描述的效果。

Result: 55.5%的原始描述为示例用途，LLM正确识别率为79.75%。生成的描述平均相似度为0.7173，表明相关但需改进。

Conclusion: 代码片段的文档意图因任务而异，LLM在生成描述时表现良好但仍有提升空间。

Abstract: Documenting code snippets is essential to pinpoint key areas where both
developers and users should pay attention. Examples include usage examples and
other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important
for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the
key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and
evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description
generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with
1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their
descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the
majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This
finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions
lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified
the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical
to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared
to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of
0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9
indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the
code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions
for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a
library.

*Yilin Zhang,Xinran Zhao,Zora Zhiruo Wang,Chenyang Yang,Jiayi Wei,Tongshuang Wu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于抽象语法树（AST）的代码分块方法（\ourwork），以解决现有行分块方法破坏语义结构的问题，显著提升了代码生成任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于行的分块方法在代码检索增强生成（RAG）中常破坏语义结构（如拆分函数或合并无关代码），影响生成质量。

Method: 提出一种基于AST的结构感知分块方法，递归分解大AST节点并合并兄弟节点，生成语义连贯的分块。

Result: 在代码生成任务中表现优异，如RepoEval检索的Recall@5提升4.3点，SWE-bench生成的Pass@1提升2.67点。

Conclusion: 结构感知分块对扩展检索增强的代码智能至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become essential for large-scale
code generation, grounding predictions in external code corpora to improve
actuality. However, a critical yet underexplored aspect of RAG pipelines is
chunking -- the process of dividing documents into retrievable units. Existing
line-based chunking heuristics often break semantic structures, splitting
functions or merging unrelated code, which can degrade generation quality. We
propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\ourwork), a structure-aware method
that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling
nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained,
semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving
performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3
points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation.
Our work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling
retrieval-enhanced code intelligence.

Motivation: 在大规模工业无线网络中，确保包级通信质量对超可靠低延迟通信（URLLC）至关重要。

Method: 结合卷积神经网络（CNN）和图着色技术，动态分配链路优先级，考虑了实时流量、传输机会和网络条件。

Result: 仿真结果显示，在三种网络配置下，SINR增益分别达到113%、94%和49%，优于LDP算法。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂URLLC场景中表现优异，显著提升了网络容量、SINR和可调度性。

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable,
low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks.
We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a
CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism for improved interference
coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static
priorities, our approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network and graph coloring
to adaptively assign link priorities based on real-time traffic, transmission
opportunities, and network conditions. Assuming that first training phase is
performed offline, our approach introduced minimal overhead, while enabling
more efficient resource allocation, boosting network capacity, SINR, and
schedulability. Simulation results show SINR gains of up to 113\%, 94\%, and
49\% over LDP across three network configurations, highlighting its
effectiveness for complex URLLC scenarios.

Result: 仿真结果显示，GCN-DQN模型在三种网络配置下比LDP算法平均SINR提升179.6%、197.4%和175.2%。

Conclusion: GCN-DQN模型能高效满足URLLC需求，性能优越且开销低。

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable,
low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks.
We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) integrated with a Deep Q-Network (DQN)
reinforcement learning framework for improved interference coordination in
multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our
approach dynamically learns link priorities based on real-time traffic demand,
network topology, remaining transmission opportunities, and interference
patterns. The GCN captures spatial dependencies, while the DQN enables adaptive
scheduling decisions through reward-guided exploration. Simulation results show
that our GCN-DQN model achieves mean SINR improvements of 179.6\%, 197.4\%, and
175.2\% over LDP across three network configurations. Additionally, the GCN-DQN
model demonstrates mean SINR improvements of 31.5\%, 53.0\%, and 84.7\% over
our previous CNN-based approach across the same configurations. These results
underscore the effectiveness of our GCN-DQN model in addressing complex URLLC
requirements with minimal overhead and superior network performance.

Motivation: 临床决策复杂且易受认知偏差和不完整信息影响，现有LLM工具的单次交互模式难以满足实际需求。

Method: 设计MedSyn框架，支持医生与LLM动态对话，医生可质疑LLM建议，LLM提供替代视角。

Result: 实验表明开源LLM作为医生助手具有潜力。

Conclusion: 未来将通过真实医生互动验证MedSyn在诊断准确性和患者结果上的实用性。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive
biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet
their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the
complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid
human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step,
interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike
static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing
physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative
perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the
potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source
LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will
involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in
diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习和优化中，Boltzmann概率分布的采样是关键，但现有方法（如Ising机）在实现时受限于软约束的强度调节问题。

Method: 提出2D-PT算法，通过在惩罚强度维度上增加副本，确保约束满足并避免显式调节惩罚强度。

Result: 在图形稀疏化和Wishart实例中，2D-PT实现了接近理想的混合速度，且比传统PT快几个数量级。

Conclusion: 2D-PT适用于广泛的约束Ising问题，并可直接部署于现有Ising机。

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine
learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such
as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary
optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft
constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce
feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the
powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by
adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This
scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to
low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel
tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and
eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a
representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT
achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as
O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of
magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The
method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on
existing Ising machines.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized
"species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a
671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM)
exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based
framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial
datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings,
information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive
patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively
contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A
pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of
higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects
compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary
layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects
domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors
the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist,
forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI
uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline
models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few
features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems,
information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging
concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI
offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical
discovery.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动定义异常检测系统中自编码器（AE）分离阈值的方法，评估了三种机器学习算法（KNN、K-Means、SVM）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自编码器的分离阈值非标准化且直接影响检测性能，需要一种自动定义阈值的方法。

Method: 使用K近邻（KNN）、K均值（K-Means）和支持向量机（SVM）三种算法自动定义阈值。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但通过评估三种算法来优化阈值定义。

Conclusion: 自动定义阈值的方法有望提升异常检测系统的性能。

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using
Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the
data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized
separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the
definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection
process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold
using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were
evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Result: 方法在数据分布变化、领域扩展和任务更新中表现良好，但对噪声数据效果不佳。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于流动参数预测，但在噪声环境下需进一步优化。

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel
testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have
traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to
challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction
model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters.
It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as
dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or
learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy
systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution
as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning
methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and
onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network
(ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights
of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally
executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this
approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i)
domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target
domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task
adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the
influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies
varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully
demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data
distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy
data is concluded to be not as effective.

Result: 在最大开源卫星图像数据集上，PIPE在深度学习和气候领域方法中均达到最优性能，台风强度预测提升12%。

Conclusion: PIPE通过有效嵌入物理信息，显著提升了多模态对齐和预测精度，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and
sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the
physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly
improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments
on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image
dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning
forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across
benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over
prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法在未知图结构下有效，为实际应用提供了理论支持和实验验证。

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for
the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing
ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how
to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While
previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked
to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that
the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we
consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled
by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and
only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split
the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination
strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm
and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph
recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove
that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with
bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective
polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments
on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and
vaccination algorithms.

Conclusion: 该方法在多深度存储系统中表现出优越性和适应性，适用于不同布局的存储系统。

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast
delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine
high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage
and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater
storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during
retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate
this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single
lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of
multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to
address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous
item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the
objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's
topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both
item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep
warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network
architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer
model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into
embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these
embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong
generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage
systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including
comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in
optimizing retrieval tardiness.

Method: 提出时间约束观察和策略轨迹观察，结合计算复杂性约束或近似时间约束观察。

Result: 策略轨迹观察下，学习可计算函数可简化为输入输出学习，但线性时间可计算函数不存在可计算或多项式质量特征集。

Conclusion: 扩展框架揭示了与有限状态转换器推断的有趣联系，但某些函数类仍存在学习障碍。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit
by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate
\textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}.
Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce
Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the
learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints.
While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of
general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by
imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate
time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around
observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable
functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from
input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state
transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or
polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time
computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

Abstract: High quality real world datasets are essential for advancing data driven

in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets

present AZT1D, a dataset containing data collected from 25 individuals with T1D
on automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data,
carbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained
over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular
details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction
specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By
offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial
intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical
decision making and individualized care in T1D.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为连续进化池（CEP）的机制，用于解决时间序列中重复概念漂移问题，通过存储不同概念的预测器实例并动态更新知识，显著提升了在线预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重复概念漂移是时间序列中常见的问题，现有方法通过参数更新延迟遗忘，但可能导致部分已学知识丢失，且缺乏知识保留机制。

Method: CEP通过存储不同概念的预测器实例，选择最接近测试样本的预测器并学习其邻近样本特征（检索机制）。若邻近样本不足，则生成新模型存储新概念知识，同时清除过时知识。

Result: 在不同架构模型和八个真实数据集上的实验表明，CEP能有效保留不同概念的知识，显著提升重复概念场景下的在线预测效果。

Conclusion: CEP通过动态知识保留和更新机制，解决了重复概念漂移问题，为在线预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed
data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of
concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and
previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in
the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter
updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss
of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of
knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully
utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool
(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for
different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test
sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we
refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it
indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the
current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.
Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be
cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on
different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP
effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of
online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the
prediction results.

Motivation: 探索如何在不重新训练或微调PLM的情况下，通过简单修改推理过程提升零样本预测性能。

Method: 在PLM的嵌入层和转换器之间注入dropout层，并在推理时通过多次采样平均输出。

Result: 在ProteinGym数据集的子集上，零样本性能得到提升，且dropout率为0.1时表现最佳。

Conclusion: 推理时注入dropout层是一种简单有效的方法，可提升PLM的零样本预测能力。

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of
zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In
this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a
PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output
akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the
ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with
dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the
PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大型语言模型（LLM）的计算成本极高（10^13-10^15 FLOPs），效率低下，因此需要一种更高效的方法来利用已有预训练模型。

Method: 通过AoE方法，线性时间内对父模型的权重张量进行插值，生成功能强大的子模型，可以增强或抑制父模型的语义特征。

Result: 生成的子模型功能强大且稳定，行为特征可逐步调整或突变。实验构建的DeepSeek R1T "Chimera"模型在保持R1级别智能的同时，减少了40%的输出令牌，推理更紧凑有序。

Conclusion: AoE方法为高效利用预训练模型提供了新途径，生成的子模型在性能和效率上均有显著提升。

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Motivation: 研究智能系统如何在保持输入身份的同时支持广泛泛化的内部表示，并揭示这种权衡的基本限制。

Method: 通过理论推导和实验验证，分析表示相似性随语义分辨率衰减的模型，并扩展到噪声和异构空间。

Result: 发现多输入处理能力的急剧下降和非单调最优泛化概率，实验验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 有限分辨率相似性是深度网络和大脑表示能力的根本约束，提供了泛化与识别权衡的精确理论。

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are
simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective
-- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.
For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with
finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions
that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification
$p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry.
Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs
predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a
non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end
reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and
empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for
linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits
persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network
and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that
finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational
constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an
exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how
semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and
brains alike.

Motivation: 在线学习在垂直联邦学习（VFL）中更具适应性，但数据异步和特征不重叠的挑战被忽视。

Result: 实验表明框架更稳定，显著降低通信和计算成本。

Conclusion: 事件驱动的在线VFL框架有效解决了异步数据和非凸模型问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating
online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL,
where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In
real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the
disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are
typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We
are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been
overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an
event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients
were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively
collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated
\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by
online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary
environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed
framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with
event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed
framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under
non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication
and computation costs.

Conclusion: ss-Mamba是一种高效、多功能的时间序列预测模型，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series
forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based
temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building
upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba
selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves
comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity
from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from
pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen
series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex
seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful
enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile
and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based
models in time-series forecasting.

differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete
optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based
optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the
continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been
comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in
continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide
additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a
first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number
of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a
result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that
allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.
As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the
directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal
linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our
theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training
machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research
established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee
convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the
aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in
whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and
investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions
from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone
do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that
reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings
due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower
bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under
box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the
number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and
$d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower
bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis
for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a
$\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the
existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented
bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We
complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated
stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

Conclusion: PARC为VLM提示敏感性分析提供了有效工具，InternVL2模型表现突出，未来可进一步优化训练数据。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual
inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual
modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be
prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this
instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt
variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to
prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via
Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built
on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and
vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees,
and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt
variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that
VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most
destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models,
outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2
family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to
training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了联邦学习（FL）在缺血性卒中患者中预测脑龄差异（BrainAGE）的性能，并探讨了其与临床表型和功能结果的关联。FL在保护隐私的同时，表现优于单中心模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题，训练稳健的BrainAGE模型需要大型数据集，而FL可以在不集中数据的情况下实现这一目标。

Method: 使用1674名卒中患者的FLAIR脑图像，比较了集中学习、FL和单中心学习的性能，并分析了BrainAGE与血管风险因素及功能结果的关系。

Result: 集中学习最准确，但FL优于单中心模型。BrainAGE与糖尿病显著相关，且与卒中后功能恢复显著关联。

Conclusion: FL无需数据集中即可实现准确预测，BrainAGE与卒中预后相关，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a
neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust
BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns.
This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE
estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy,
and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional
outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients
across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep
learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies:
centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and
single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations
between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months
post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for
these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,
time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and
recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate
predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.
Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and
multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the
association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data
centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors,
and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in
stroke care.

Method: 采用Model-Router框架，动态选择适合每种产品需求模式的预测模型（包括经典、机器学习和深度学习方法），并比较了规则、LightGBM和InceptionTime路由器的效果。

Result: 在大规模Favorita数据集上，深度学习（InceptionTime）路由器将预测准确性提高了11.8%（NWRMSLE），推理速度提升了4.67倍。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了预测精度，有助于减少缺货和过剩库存，体现了智能自适应AI在优化供应链中的关键作用。

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a
critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model
accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a
Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting
model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its
unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime
routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies,
effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand
regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita
dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting
accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with
4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision
will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess
inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in
optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

network approaches, we show that the number of parameters of the proposed
approach grows linearly with respect to the number of tasks, and does not
sacrifice plasticity to scale. Experiments conducted in benchmark continuous
control and visual problems reveal that the proposed approach achieves greater
knowledge transfer and performance than alternative methods.

Motivation: DXA扫描成本高且耗时，需要一种更经济高效的替代方法。

Method: 使用3D光学图像提取的生物标志物，应用p-Laplacian回归模型和多种监督学习算法（如SVR）进行预测。

Result: p-Laplacian模型在10%训练数据下误差为ALM 13%、BMD 10%、BFP 20%；监督算法中SVR表现最佳。

Conclusion: p-Laplacian模型在数据受限的医疗应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as
Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral
Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases.
Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to
measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This
work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine
learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc)
obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was
sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data
in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However,
most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive,
requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we
implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This
paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for
regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM,
$\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for
10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support
Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of
$\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with
$\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position
the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications,
particularly in a data-constrained environment.

Method: 采用GRPO训练小规模模型，结合简单奖励结构、简化工具调用接口、为工具调用结果分配额外令牌，以及侧重视觉难度高的训练数据。

Result: 在视觉问答任务中，该方法优于类似规模的基线模型。

Conclusion: GRPO训练结合外部工具能有效提升小规模模型的详细视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability,
vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning,
especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we
draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools
such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO
learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface,
allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training
data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to
similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some
visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual
information gathered from the external tool.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在现实场景中面临分布式数据和隐私问题，传统联邦学习方法因模型规模大而难以应用。

Method: FedNano将大语言模型集中在服务器端，客户端仅部署轻量级NanoEdge模块，包含特定模态编码器和低秩适配器。

Result: 实验显示FedNano显著减少客户端存储和通信开销，性能优于现有联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: FedNano为大规模MLLMs的联邦学习提供了可行方案，支持去中心化多模态AI系统。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal
reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in
real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy
requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling
collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL
for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational
demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and
heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of
full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their
massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we
propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server
while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific
adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and
trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the
need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and
limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By
transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous
client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments
demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap
between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized
multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the

This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent
surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian
Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and
XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational
properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their
capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield
strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average
hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary
computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of
hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic,
heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics.
Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior
outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property
correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy
positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and
data-efficient materials design.

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data
reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that
incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and
stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively
integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing
capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling
advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward
dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head
attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's
sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the
proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set
and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%,
demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary
classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical
approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization
bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical
value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The
results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing
early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting
intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud
computing data centers and edge storage environments.

Conclusion: CACTUS通过消除不相关或有偏见的数据，为临床决策提供了更可靠的工具，并促进了与临床医生的反馈互动。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative
samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative
Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study
different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an
approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method
does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM
implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the
negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the
binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative
samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial
Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary
SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the
lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms
the binary SVM.

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes
discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the
prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting
federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by
leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on
federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost
associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted
a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated
black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to
activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne},
enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning.
Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated
black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency
when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on
various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in
query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight
vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At
convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit:
$a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these
channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of
critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like
SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression
settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with
finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture
of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and
functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of
the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities
of fully connected layers.

Motivation: 探索强化学习在大语言模型推理中的广泛适用性，解决跨领域可靠奖励信号的挑战。

Method: 构建Guru语料库，通过领域特定奖励设计、去重和过滤确保可靠性，并训练Guru-7B和Guru-32B模型。

Result: Guru模型在六个推理领域的17项任务中表现最佳，分别优于基线7.9%和6.7%。

Conclusion: RL在不同领域的表现差异显著，某些领域需要领域内训练才能取得显著提升，表明RL可能促进真实技能获取。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

*Aayush Mishra,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的误差估计方法（ODD），通过避免源域和目标域重叠区域的竞争，更准确地预测目标域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（DIS²）在源域和目标域重叠区域存在竞争问题，导致误差估计不够准确。

Method: 提出Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy（ODD），利用域分类器估计域重叠，仅在非重叠目标域最大化分歧。

Result: 实验表明，ODD在多个基准测试中提高了性能估计的准确性，同时保持有效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: ODD方法优于DIS²，能更准确地预测目标域性能，适用于安全智能系统。

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test
domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses
disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under
distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the
target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this
approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target
error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement
discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and
target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement
should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to
high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).
Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain,
removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to
estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We
conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method
improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and
reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 该研究利用稀疏基线临床数据和12周的日常数字Floodlight数据，通过先进的表格和时间序列基础模型、多模态注意力变换器及机器学习方法，预测多发性硬化症（MS）的48周和72周残疾进展。


<details>

Motivation: 早期预测多发性硬化症的残疾进展具有挑战性，因为疾病异质性高。研究旨在通过结合临床和数字数据，提高预测准确性。

Method: 使用了最先进的表格和时间序列基础模型、自定义多模态注意力变换器及机器学习方法，整合临床和数字数据。

Result: 尽管早期预测难度大（AUROC 0.63），但通过先进模型整合数字数据显著提升了性能。多模态变换器表现优于单模态模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基础模型和多模态方法能够从复杂的临床和数字数据中提取预测信号，为多发性硬化症及其他复杂疾病提供更准确的预后。

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is
challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week
disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital
Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed
state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom
multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite
the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via
advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer
model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but
our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart,
confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings
demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive
signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g.,
imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially
other complex diseases.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在公平性和效率上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为多智能体系统中的公平决策提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at
ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system
performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited
information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing
framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before
allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we
leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a
provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an
algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach
outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ICU时间序列数据中状态表示学习的不稳定性问题及其对强化学习策略性能的负面影响。

Method: 采用CDE状态表示，结合早期停止或稳定化方法确保训练稳定性，并通过临床评分（如SOFA、SAPS-II、OASIS）进行相关性正则化。

Result: 稳定训练的CDE表示与临床评分强相关，并实现高性能强化学习策略（WIS回报>0.9）；不稳定训练则导致策略失败（WIS回报≈0）。

Conclusion: 强调在临床强化学习中，训练稳定性对序列表示学习的关键作用，为使用CDE编码不规则医疗时间序列提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on
learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU
time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for
this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential
representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been
overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)
state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are
met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization
methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation
regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the
MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces
representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies
with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE
representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return
$\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only
separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity
score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.
These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode
irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training
stability in sequential representation learning.

Motivation: 现有监督微调方法对所有令牌一视同仁，忽略了关键任务相关令牌的重要性。

Method: SFT-GO根据令牌重要性分组，结合最差组损失和标准交叉熵损失优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，SFT-GO在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，且适用于不同数据集和基础模型。

Conclusion: SFT-GO通过动态关注关键令牌组，显著提升了模型性能，具有鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large
language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream
tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as
a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their
relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains
critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that
treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups
tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM
using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard
cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging
token groups and guides the model to better handle different group
distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a
theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its
efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping
strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform
baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold
across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the
effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

Result: 在多个数据集（ImageNet、COCO、GLUE等）上，SPG显著提升模型性能（+0.2∼7%），计算成本低。

Conclusion: SPG是一种高效、轻量级的超参数优化方法，具有广泛的工业应用潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and
hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread
use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3
multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient
modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online
hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient
methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to
generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our
experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on
their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We
evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural
language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial
applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements
across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$,
with significantly low computational costs. Fully reproducible code and

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important
research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has
demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation
remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a
theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family
of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to
Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the
theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with
decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces
a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only
demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to
natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$,
allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and
constrained optimization algorithms.

Result: 在多个基准问题上验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: HiPreNets框架显著提升了神经网络的精度，尤其在L∞误差方面表现优异。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in
science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes
challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and
numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and
traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE)
while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many
applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework
for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our
approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural
networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by
sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks,
leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the
structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of
parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We
validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive
core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from
failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can
lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not
exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations
in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task
inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur,
what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To
achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an
existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher
than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we
find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task
inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible
tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each
scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning
strategies.

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal
traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience.
However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous
sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper
proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes
low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic
data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural
architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic
tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time
intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism
employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while
stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations
to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban
traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art
baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with
neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet
flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering
critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive
traffic control systems.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance
(e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for
ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning
models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively
verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly
executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification
methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing
approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation.
To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine
unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current
techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and
parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess
unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category,
analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify
potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a
set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a
foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded
unlearning verification mechanisms.

Result: 在非凸设置下提供了收敛保证和更紧的学习误差界限，并通过数值模拟验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: ImprovDML在隐私保护与模型准确性之间实现了更好的权衡，优于差分隐私方法。

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed
machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy
involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential
privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often
results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue,
we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high
model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and
resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient
vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal
(non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each
iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients
for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive
asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter
than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the
notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based
on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an
improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to
differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical
results.

Conclusion: SKIL通过组合表示生成行为模型，为复杂动物行为的动态组合提供了简洁且原则性的解释。

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet
diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify
this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative
assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce
skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a
reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable
skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging
representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes
policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a
simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely
moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns
continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic
trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By
exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our
method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors
emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look
promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual
quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical
analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically
quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary
1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of
data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the
generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence
rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces
by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a
white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model.
The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically.
Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear
models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural
Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to
the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case.
Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing
generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also
demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models
whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of
black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for
measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the
Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

*Yee Hin Chong,Peng Qu*

TL;DR: SoKA是一种参数高效微调方法，通过Kronecker分解和SVD初始化动态选择秩，减少参数和计算开销，同时保持或超越基线性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有PEFT方法在推理延迟、收敛性和固定秩选择上的不足，提高大规模模型微调的效率和性能。

Method: 结合Kronecker乘积张量分解和SVD驱动的初始化，动态选择秩并剪枝不重要的分量。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B上，SoKA仅需0.99M可训练参数，比LoRA/PiSSA少25%，性能相当或更好，收敛更快且梯度更稳定。

Conclusion: SoKA是一种高效、稳健的PEFT方法，适用于大规模模型适配。

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across
diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial
storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of
task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce
inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence
(randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may
not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that
combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization
and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD)
procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact
Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses
energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal
mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires
only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or
exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and
more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for
large-scale model adaptation.

Conclusion: 该方法为版权所有者提供了可靠的数据使用验证工具，适用于现实世界的法律诉讼。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly
attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the
internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset
Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect
dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify
unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to
be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's
distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in
practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address
this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our
approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse
synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we
achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based
completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic
data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on
diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set
enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while
maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to
make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability
for real-world litigations. Our code is available at

Motivation: 随着电动汽车普及，需要数据丰富且地理可扩展的基础设施规划工具，以协调城市、郊区和农村的不同需求。

Method: 方法包括栅格化异构数据、图神经网络中心性模型、Voronoi镶嵌、M/M/c队列和贪婪最大覆盖启发式算法。

Result: 在佐治亚州应用中，DOVA-PATBM提高了覆盖范围，减少了低收入居民到充电站的平均距离，并满足电力容量限制。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了紧密结合GNN和多分辨率方法在学术优化与可部署基础设施政策之间的桥梁作用。

Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure
planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas
most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide
and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense
metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural
corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented,
Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework
that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises
heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines)
onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a
zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi
tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within
every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and
floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under
feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage
heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of
sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile
coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income
residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission
headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for
national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated,
GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic
optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

Conclusion: 该研究是生成AI在跨境电商供应链金融风险管理中的首次应用，为提升信用实践和改善中小企业融资提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant
opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing
remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party
logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising
solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced
credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual
challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically,
we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through
Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for
risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible
estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk
measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these
risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To
capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate
QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit
risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering
application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid
foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

Conclusion: SecFwT为隐私关键应用提供了可扩展且安全的LLM微调方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their
adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as
healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training
data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to
protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has
been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant
computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward
propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary
obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the
substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2)
the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework
designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a
forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations
and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax
attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and
computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers
substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling
scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets
remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse
rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active
learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational
autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity,
molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between
expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively
constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking
thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus
main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently
generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We
demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters
within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial
chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design
problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a
generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological
landscapes.

Result: 多层或循环Transformer能通过隐式构造多项式有效利用未标记数据，且深度与多项式幂次呈指数关系。

Conclusion: 通过循环现成的表格基础模型，显著提升了半监督学习性能。

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

Conclusion: 该方法有效处理了缺失值问题，结合了LLM与表格数据，提升了临床实验室数据的预测性能。

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making.
Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of
performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early
diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood
Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining
routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that
varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing
values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation
problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding
and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type
embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values
without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the
tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an
improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose,
cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional
force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD
simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data
encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures.
Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as
a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in
material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers,
making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures.
To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a
non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy
landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including
the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework
employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a
dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a
smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene
glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving
comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to
existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT
calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without
sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full
Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior
distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these
methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise
unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based
solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from
diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting
factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the
approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains
unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We
address the issue by employing a Schr\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between
the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate
the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we
extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge
($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional
Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To
validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the
reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the
observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion
model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function
evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with
supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the
algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on
the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing
techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent
work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in
white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the
more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during
training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that
there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical
upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches
for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in
the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on
CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes
quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially
maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in
generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling
choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules
introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph
information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and
designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying
sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address
these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing
of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we
introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate
seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different
attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and
SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off
between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard
conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC
achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results
highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality
and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative
modeling of molecular structures. Code available at

Conclusion: 新方法解决了传统度量的局限性，为最优传输提供了更灵活的度量学习框架。

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability
distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of
the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been
(i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a
supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for
enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot
account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features
in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often
do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions
with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach
for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space.
Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric,
but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The
learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances,
leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification
tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach
using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for
exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We
introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over
the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion
model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density
estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome
this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental
connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and
its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror
descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a
pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal
exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent
understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on
both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating
promising results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统依赖黑箱模型（如深度神经网络），其复杂性导致透明度不足，XAI虽提供解释，但缺乏标准化评估方法。

Method: 采用PRISMA指南进行系统文献综述，分析362篇相关文献，提出VXAI框架，包含41个功能相似的指标组和三维分类方案。

Result: 提出了最全面和结构化的VXAI框架，支持指标选择、方法比较，并为未来扩展提供基础。

Conclusion: VXAI框架填补了XAI评估的标准化空白，为领域提供了系统化的工具和方向。

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably
Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with
millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major
challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency.
Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable
explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and
trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the
growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation
protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct
a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a
unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant
publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar
metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization
scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation
quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and
structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection,
promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for
future extensions.

Conclusion: 本文系统性地综述了奖励建模技术，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the
environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy
optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired
objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also
fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from
both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward
models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate
policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining
the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an
overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the
source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this
understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling
techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we
conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.
Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling
the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

Result: 在部分可观测环境中，基于记忆的方法比无记忆基线表现更好。

Conclusion: 基于记忆的架构能有效提升零样本强化学习在部分可观测环境中的性能。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot
reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an
environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such
assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only
partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard
zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and
show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective
remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the
states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show
improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via:

TL;DR: RHO提出了一种半监督图异常检测方法，通过自适应学习正常节点的同质性模式，解决了现有方法假设不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设正常节点的同质性一致且标签节点能充分代表正常类，但现实中正常节点的同质性可能多样。

Method: RHO包含两个模块：AdaFreq（自适应频率响应滤波器）和GNA（图正态对齐），分别学习多频同质性模式并增强一致性。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上，RHO显著优于现有方法，能有效学习多样同质性。

Conclusion: RHO通过自适应学习同质性模式，提升了半监督图异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled
normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in
a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a
similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent
the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does
not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in
real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily
Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two
novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph
normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters
that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with
varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node
attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise
and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned
by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets
show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily
in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
competing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/RHO.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，通过简化时间序列的扭曲路径，突出关键变换（如位移、压缩和振幅差异），以增强时间序列比较的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可视化方法仅关注点对点对齐，无法展示子序列级别的结构关系，难以理解时间序列之间的位移、加速或减速。

Method: 提出了一种新技术，简化扭曲路径，量化并可视化关键变换（位移、压缩、振幅差异）。

Result: 方法能够更清晰地展示子序列之间的匹配关系，提升时间序列比较的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法为时间序列比较提供了更直观和结构化的可视化工具，有助于理解时间序列的动态变化。

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and
classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a
robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is
missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do
not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences.
This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series
shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we
propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight,
quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in
amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match
between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series
comparison.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into
lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to
explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of
variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection
framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable,
data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via
natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships
of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data
dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not
only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive,
user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR
techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and
adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LIT-LVM的方法，用于高效估计线性预测器中交互项的系数，通过低维潜在向量表示特征，减少过拟合并提升预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性预测器中交互项的系数估计在统计学和机器学习中常见，但高维数据下容易过拟合，需要更有效的正则化方法。

Method: 假设交互项系数具有低维结构，用低维潜在向量表示特征，结合结构化正则化方法（LIT-LVM）。

Result: LIT-LVM在模拟和真实数据上表现优于弹性网络和因子分解机，尤其在交互项数量远多于样本数时。

Conclusion: LIT-LVM不仅提升预测准确性，还提供了特征的低维潜在表示，便于可视化和分析特征关系。

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and
machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear
predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding
interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We
consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction
terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different
interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent
each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This
low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization
approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond
standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that
our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to
elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real
data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the
number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations
for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our
code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了时空图神经网络（STGNNs）中的信息传播问题，特别是时空过压缩现象，并分析了其与静态图的不同特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管图神经网络（GNNs）在多个领域取得了成功，但其信息传播能力存在局限性，如过压缩问题。在时空图神经网络中，这一问题因时间维度而加剧，但尚未被深入研究。

Method: 论文形式化了时空过压缩问题，并通过理论分析揭示了卷积STGNNs在信息传播中的反直觉特性。还比较了不同处理范式（时间-空间或时间优先）的影响。

Result: 研究发现，卷积STGNNs倾向于传播时间上较远而非较近的信息，且不同处理范式均受此现象影响。理论分析支持了计算高效实现的可能性。

Conclusion: 论文通过合成和真实数据集验证了发现，为STGNNs的设计提供了更深入的理论指导和实践建议。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental
limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as
over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information.
While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in
Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph
nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by
increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize
the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct
characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that
counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from
points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that
architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing
paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical
justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our
findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into
their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

TL;DR: RePCS是一种轻量级方法，用于检测RAG系统是否有效利用检索信息，避免依赖记忆数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统中模型可能依赖记忆数据而非检索信息的问题。

Method: 通过比较仅使用查询的推理路径和结合检索上下文的路径的KL散度来检测行为。

Result: 在Prompt-WNQA基准测试中，RePCS的ROC-AUC为0.918，优于之前方法6.5个百分点。

Conclusion: RePCS提供了一种无需模型访问或重新训练的轻量级解决方案，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for
updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external
information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass
the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce
Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects
such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two
inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a
retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by
computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output
distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal
impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,
requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single
additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the
KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the
Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result
outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping
latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight,
black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages
retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

Conclusion: 简化后的分析使SGD理论更易理解，有助于进一步优化实际模型训练。

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization
algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work
by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear
regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate
averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we
provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds
provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools,
bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite
(PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear
regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing
mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the
training of realistic models.

Result: PRISM在语言模型上表现优于现有方法，提高了描述质量和多义性捕捉能力。

Conclusion: PRISM能更好地描述神经网络特征的复杂性，提升模型行为的可解释性。

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results
in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly
understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but
they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this
difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which
suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due
to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We
propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling
robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our
interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established
algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong
performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of
agents and suites of environments.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges
in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device
heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing
approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this
work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that
jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC
introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from
location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder.
Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment
mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.
Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances
demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

Conclusion: LogNet不仅提升了深度学习模型的可解释性，还优化了性能，适用于长期稳定的室内定位部署。

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy
in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing
DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how
predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This
lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of
temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models
for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic
gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor
localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access
points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how
environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This
interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL
systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple
real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show
that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also
improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error,
3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to
prior DL-based models.

Abstract: Compositionality is one of the fundamental abilities of the human reasoning
process, that allows to decompose a complex problem into simpler elements. Such
property is crucial also for neural networks, especially when aiming for a more
efficient and sustainable AI framework. We propose a compositional approach by
ensembling zero-shot a set of expert models, assessing our methodology using a
challenging benchmark, designed to test compositionality capabilities. We show
that our Expert Composition method is able to achieve a much higher accuracy
than baseline algorithms while requiring less computational resources, hence
being more efficient.

*Le Vu Anh,Nguyen Viet Anh,Mehmet Dik,Tu Nguyen Thi Ngoc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MicroRicci是一种新型的局部Ricci流求解器，通过结合编码理论和轻量级神经网络模块，实现了高效的自适应网格平滑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Ricci流求解器全局更新成本高和贪婪启发式方法收敛慢或调参困难的问题。

Method: 采用贪婪综合解码步骤定位并修正最大曲率误差，结合两个小型神经网络模块动态选择顶点和步长。

Result: 在110个SJTU-TMQA网格上，迭代次数减少2.4倍，曲率分布更紧，UV失真与MOS相关性达-0.93，每迭代仅增加0.25ms。

Conclusion: MicroRicci适用于实时资源受限的图形和模拟应用，因其线性时间更新、自适应超参数和高几何质量。

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical
Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer
from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly
self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and
packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy
syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error
in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose
vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes,
MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup),
tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable
UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per
iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration
over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates,
automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual
results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in
graphics, simulation, and related fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-GRAPE是一种新的差分隐私训练方法，通过梯度随机投影显著降低内存使用，同时保持与现有方法相当的效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准差分隐私方法（如DP-Adam）因逐样本梯度裁剪导致高内存开销，限制了可扩展性。

Method: DP-GRAPE通过三个关键改进：梯度投影后私有化、使用高斯随机矩阵替代SVD子空间、在反向传播中应用投影。

Result: 实验表明，DP-GRAPE在预训练Vision Transformers和微调RoBERTa-Large时分别减少63%和70%内存使用，且性能相当。

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE是一种高效且可扩展的差分隐私训练方法，适用于大规模模型。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network
training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead
due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce
DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly
reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP
approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces
three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2)
random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is
applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for
costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to
improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our
theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off
comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE
can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or
training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when
pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as
compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further
demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with
up to 6.7 billion parameters.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的方法LoX，通过外推对齐LLM的安全子空间，显著提升了模型对微调攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对齐模型在安全方面有所改进，但微调仍可能破坏其安全保护，即使数据看似无害。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX)方法，外推对齐LLM的安全子空间，增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，LoX在面对良性或恶意微调攻击时，攻击成功率（ASR）绝对降低了11%至54%。

Conclusion: LoX通过将LLM参数移动到更平坦的区域，减少对扰动的敏感性，从而有效提升安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at
github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

Motivation: 机器学习中的公平性对构建可信赖的AI系统至关重要，但训练数据中的标签偏差会影响模型性能和公平性评估。

Method: 结合预测置信度度量、基于图的拉普拉斯正则化和显式人口统计公平性激励。

Result: 实验结果表明，GFLC在性能和公平性指标之间取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: GFLC是一种有效的方法，能够在纠正标签噪声的同时保持数据公平性。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building
trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems
increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions
and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair
outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However,
the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased
and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects
model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.
To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label
Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while
preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines
three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization
through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity
incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed
approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance
and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoRule是一种自动化方法，通过从用户偏好反馈中提取规则并转化为基于规则的奖励，提升强化学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于规则的奖励方法依赖人工规则设计，AutoRule旨在实现完全自动化，减少人工干预。

Method: AutoRule分三阶段：利用推理模型解释用户偏好，从推理链中提取候选规则，并合成统一规则集。使用语言模型验证规则满足度作为辅助奖励。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B模型上，AutoRule带来28.6%的相对胜率提升和6.1%的第二轮表现增益。规则与数据集偏好一致，且减少了奖励滥用。

Conclusion: AutoRule能自动提取与数据集偏好一致的规则，有效提升强化学习性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at
https://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoRule.

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，CAWR显著提升了策略优化的性能。

Conclusion: CAWR通过鲁棒优化和数据筛选，有效解决了AWR方法的保守性问题，适用于低质量离线数据。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require
additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues,
such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy
optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on
a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the
potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption,
specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from
two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal
policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the
approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such
over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for
policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor
explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose
Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a
set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based
prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical
experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior
policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance
of policy optimization.

Motivation: 研究密集潜在特征的几何、功能和起源，以验证其是否为训练过程中的不良产物。

Method: 系统分析密集潜在特征的几何结构、功能分类及其在模型各层的演化。

Result: 密集潜在特征形成反极对，重构残差流中的特定方向，并具有功能分类（如位置跟踪、语义绑定等）。

Conclusion: 密集潜在特征在语言模型计算中具有功能性作用，不应被视为训练噪声。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function,
enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based

Motivation: 传统零售视频标注依赖耗时的人工标注，成本高且效率低。

Method: 利用深度神经网络学习视频帧特征，结合零售环境定制的目标检测技术，实现关键帧自动识别和标注。

Result: 实验表明，该方法准确性接近人工标注，成本节省约2倍，仅需人工验证5%的帧。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升零售视频标注效率，适用于顾客行为分析、产品交互检测等多种应用。

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

Result: 在多个医疗图像数据集上的实验表明，FCRE方法优于现有MIA方法。

Conclusion: FCRE方法有效解决了医疗图像扩散模型的隐私风险量化问题，为MIA提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

Conclusion: 通过Wasserstein距离对齐分布，有效解决了向量量化中的关键问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: NERO提供了一种可解释且高效的OOD检测框架，适用于医疗影像领域。

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

Result: ViMaR生成的描述更可靠、准确且详细，速度提升4倍以上，并能跨模型泛化。

Conclusion: ViMaR展示了高效、可扩展的推理策略潜力，并能通过自训练进一步提升模型性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

### [122] [DisProtEdit: Exploring Disentangled Representations for Multi-Attribute Protein Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14853)
*Max Ku,Sun Sun,Hongyu Guo,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: DisProtEdit是一个可控的蛋白质编辑框架，通过双通道自然语言监督学习解耦的结构和功能表示，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖联合整体嵌入，缺乏模块化和可解释性控制，因此需要一种能够明确分离语义因素的框架。

Method: 构建SwissProtDis数据集，使用对齐和均匀性目标对齐蛋白质和文本嵌入，并通过解耦损失促进结构和功能语义的独立性。

Result: 在蛋白质编辑和表示学习基准测试中表现优异，多属性编辑基准测试的成功率达到61.7%。

Conclusion: DisProtEdit在保持竞争力的同时提供了更高的可解释性和可控性。

Abstract: We introduce DisProtEdit, a controllable protein editing framework that
leverages dual-channel natural language supervision to learn disentangled
representations of structural and functional properties. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on joint holistic embeddings, DisProtEdit explicitly
separates semantic factors, enabling modular and interpretable control. To
support this, we construct SwissProtDis, a large-scale multimodal dataset where
each protein sequence is paired with two textual descriptions, one for
structure and one for function, automatically decomposed using a large language
model. DisProtEdit aligns protein and text embeddings using alignment and
uniformity objectives, while a disentanglement loss promotes independence
between structural and functional semantics. At inference time, protein editing
is performed by modifying one or both text inputs and decoding from the updated
latent representation. Experiments on protein editing and representation
learning benchmarks demonstrate that DisProtEdit performs competitively with
existing methods while providing improved interpretability and controllability.
On a newly constructed multi-attribute editing benchmark, the model achieves a
both-hit success rate of up to 61.7%, highlighting its effectiveness in
coordinating simultaneous structural and functional edits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于蛋白质基础模型领域缺乏统一的评估标准，研究者难以全面理解模型的泛化能力和局限性。

Method: 通过PFMBench，对17个最新蛋白质基础模型在38个任务上进行评估，揭示任务间的相关性并提供标准化评估协议。

Result: PFMBench揭示了任务间的内在相关性，识别了表现最佳的模型，并提供了简化的评估流程。

Conclusion: PFMBench填补了蛋白质基础模型评估的空白，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This study investigates the current landscape and future directions of
protein foundation model research. While recent advancements have transformed
protein science and engineering, the field lacks a comprehensive benchmark for
fair evaluation and in-depth understanding. Since ESM-1B, numerous protein
foundation models have emerged, each with unique datasets and methodologies.
However, evaluations often focus on limited tasks tailored to specific models,
hindering insights into broader generalization and limitations. Specifically,
researchers struggle to understand the relationships between tasks, assess how
well current models perform across them, and determine the criteria in
developing new foundation models. To fill this gap, we present PFMBench, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating protein foundation models across 38 tasks
spanning 8 key areas of protein science. Through hundreds of experiments on 17
state-of-the-art models across 38 tasks, PFMBench reveals the inherent
correlations between tasks, identifies top-performing models, and provides a
streamlined evaluation protocol. Code is available at

TL;DR: FORTRESS是一个专家设计的对抗性提示数据集，用于评估大型语言模型在国家安全和公共安全领域的防护能力，揭示了模型在风险与实用性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试未能客观、稳健地评估大型语言模型在国家安全和公共安全领域的防护能力，因此需要开发新的评估工具。

Method: 引入FORTRESS数据集，包含500个专家设计的对抗性提示和评分标准，覆盖三个领域（CBRNE、政治暴力与恐怖主义、犯罪与金融非法活动），并测试模型的过度拒绝行为。

Result: 不同模型在风险与实用性之间表现出不同权衡，如Claude-3.5-Sonnet风险低但过度拒绝高，Gemini 2.5 Pro风险高但过度拒绝低。

Conclusion: FORTRESS为政策制定者和研究者提供了清晰的模型风险评估工具，数据集已公开。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) introduces dual-use
capabilities that could both threaten and bolster national security and public
safety (NSPS). Models implement safeguards to protect against potential misuse
relevant to NSPS and allow for benign users to receive helpful information.
However, current benchmarks often fail to test safeguard robustness to
potential NSPS risks in an objective, robust way. We introduce FORTRESS: 500
expert-crafted adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics of 4-7 binary
questions for automated evaluation across 3 domains (unclassified information
only): Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE),
Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities,
with 10 total subcategories across these domains. Each prompt-rubric pair has a
corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation
of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between
potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low
average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score
(ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but
a high average potential risk (66.29). Deepseek-R1 has the highest ARS at
78.05, but the lowest ORS at only 0.06. Models such as o1 display a more even
trade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and
ORS of 5.2). To provide policymakers and researchers with a clear understanding
of models' potential risks, we publicly release FORTRESS at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScaleAI/fortress_public. We also maintain a
private set for evaluation.

Motivation: 随着LLM在社会科学研究中的应用增加，评估其模拟人类行为的准确性变得至关重要。

Method: 使用假设检验构建定量框架，评估LLM模拟与人类行为在多选题调查中的差异。

Result: 研究发现流行语言模型在模拟争议性问题时与特定子群体不匹配。

Conclusion: 强调了在社会科学研究中使用LLM时需要新实践，避免简单模拟人类行为。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出了Transit for All (TFA)框架，通过空间计算指导自行车共享系统(BSS)的公平扩展，以解决纽约市低收入和少数族裔社区的交通不平等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低收入和少数族裔社区在公共交通可及性上存在明显差距，自行车共享系统可以填补这一空白，但传统方法难以预测新站点的需求和评估实际使用潜力。

Method: TFA框架包括三个部分：(1) 基于区域表示学习的自行车共享需求预测，(2) 结合自行车共享需求和传统指标的加权公共交通可及性评估(wPTAL)，(3) 考虑公平性的新站点选址策略。

Result: 在纽约市的案例中，TFA显著减少了与经济和人种因素相关的交通不平等。

Conclusion: TFA为城市规划者提供了促进交通公平的实用工具，提升了服务不足社区的生活质量。

Abstract: Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in
densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and
minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing
systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and
last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved
neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly
planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional
accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We
introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to
guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1)
spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using
region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2)
comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted
Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted
bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3)
strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider
potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we
identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income
and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results
show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces
disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From
our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban
planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in
underserved urban communities.

*Václav Blažej,Sushmita Gupta,M. S. Ramanujan,Peter Strulo*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: EFX分配问题在二分图下可多项式时间求解，但在接近二分图或引入非二元值时变为NP难。参数化分析显示，树宽有限的图可线性时间求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索EFX分配问题的可解性边界，特别是在图结构限制下的算法复杂性。

Method: 使用参数化图算法分析EFX-orientation，研究二分图、接近二分图及树宽有限的图的可解性。

Result: EFX分配在接近二分图或非二元值时变为NP难，但在树宽有限的图中可线性时间求解。

Conclusion: 二分图是EFX可解的关键条件，但接近二分图或非二元值会显著增加复杂性。

Abstract: Since its introduction, envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) has become a
fundamental solution concept in fair division of indivisible goods. Its
existence remains elusive -- even for four agents with additive utility
functions, it is unknown whether an EFX allocation always exists.
Unsurprisingly, restricted settings to delineate tractable and intractable
cases have been explored. Christadolou, Fiat et al.[EC'23] introduced the
notion of EFX-orientation, where the agents form the vertices of a graph and
the items correspond to edges, and an agent values only the items that are
incident to it. The goal is to allocate items to one of the adjacent agents
while satisfying the EFX condition.
  Building on the work of Zeng and Mehta'24, which established a sharp
complexity threshold based on the structure of the underlying graph --
polynomial-time solvability for bipartite graphs and NP-hardness for graphs
with chromatic number at least three -- we further explore the algorithmic
landscape of EFX-orientation using parameterized graph algorithms.
  Specifically, we show that bipartiteness is a surprisingly stringent
condition for tractability: EFX orientation is NP-complete even when the
valuations are symmetric, binary and the graph is at most two edge-removals
away from being bipartite. Moreover, introducing a single non-binary value
makes the problem NP-hard even when the graph is only one edge removal away
from being bipartite. We further perform a parameterized analysis to examine
structures of the underlying graph that enable tractability. In particular, we
show that the problem is solvable in linear time on graphs whose treewidth is
bounded by a constant and that the complexity of an instance is closely tied to
the sizes of acyclic connected components on its one-valued edges.

TL;DR: GemNet-T作为MLFF，通过两种训练策略（直接训练和预训练+微调）在MD17数据集上表现良好，但预训练模型显著提高了模拟稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ab initio分子动力学模拟中计算成本高的问题，探索预训练对模拟稳定性的影响。

Method: 使用GemNet-T模型，比较直接训练和预训练+微调两种策略在MD17数据集上的表现。

Result: 两种策略均达到低力误差（5 meV/A），但预训练模型模拟稳定性更高，轨迹持续时间长三倍。

Conclusion: 预训练在大规模数据集上有助于捕捉复杂分子相互作用，力误差不能完全衡量模拟稳定性。

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution
for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate
force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this
work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and
investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples)
without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset
followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force
mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower
force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the
pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability,
sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from
scratch. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse
datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE
alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.

Main category: stat.OT

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新型神经网络架构，用于高时空分辨率预测三种类型的暴力冲突，并在分类和回归任务中均取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测高时空分辨率的暴力冲突是研究者和政策制定者的核心挑战。

Result: 模型在所有任务中均达到最优性能，并能生成预测后验分布以量化不确定性。

Conclusion: 该模型具有高度扩展性，适用于早期预警系统和人道主义响应规划。

Abstract: Forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution remains
a central challenge for both researchers and policymakers. This study presents
a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of
violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational
(priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs
classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and
expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions
to quantify forecast uncertainty.
  The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies
with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing
approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on
historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn
complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict.
  Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also
highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly
forecast auxiliary variables. These capabilities make it a promising tool for
early warning systems, humanitarian response planning, and evidence-based
peacebuilding initiatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在高维数据分类任务中，如何通过组合假设和Tsybakov噪声条件优化分类器的性能。

Method: 利用组合假设和Tsybakov噪声条件，分析最优收敛率，并通过ReLU深度神经网络实现该收敛率。

Result: 证明了最优收敛率与输入维度无关，ReLU深度神经网络可以达到该收敛率（对数因子内）。

Conclusion: 为ReLU深度神经网络在高维分类任务中的优异表现提供了理论支持，扩展了现有理论框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the binary classification problem on $[0,1]^d$ under
the Tsybakov noise condition (with exponent $s \in [0,\infty]$) and the
compositional assumption. This assumption requires the conditional class
probability function of the data distribution to be the composition of $q+1$
vector-valued multivariate functions, where each component function is either a
maximum value function or a H\"{o}lder-$\beta$ smooth function that depends
only on $d_*$ of its input variables. Notably, $d_*$ can be significantly
smaller than the input dimension $d$. We prove that, under these conditions,
the optimal convergence rate for the excess 0-1 risk of classifiers is $$
\left( \frac{1}{n}
\right)^{\frac{\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}{{\frac{d_*}{s+1}+(1+\frac{1}{s+1})\cdot\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}}}\;\;\;,
$$ which is independent of the input dimension $d$. Additionally, we
demonstrate that ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with hinge loss can
achieve this optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. This result
provides theoretical justification for the excellent performance of ReLU DNNs
in practical classification tasks, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
The technique used to establish these results extends the oracle inequality
presented in our previous work. The generalized approach is of independent
interest.

Motivation: 传统CMR估计器在两阶段方法中直接插入第一阶段估计会导致第二阶段严重偏差，尤其是在使用深度神经网络（DNN）时。

Method: 提出DML-CMR算法，基于双/去偏机器学习（DML）框架，设计新的学习目标以减少偏差。

Result: DML-CMR在参数化和温和正则条件下实现了最小最优收敛率O(N^{-1/2})，并在真实数据集上优于现有CMR估计器。

Conclusion: DML-CMR在解决CMR问题时表现出色，适用于工具变量回归和近端因果学习等任务。

Abstract: Solving conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) is a key problem considered in
statistics, causal inference, and econometrics, where the aim is to solve for a
function of interest that satisfies some conditional moment equalities.
Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental
variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems.
Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation
is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest.
However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in
the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR
estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where
regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage
CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate
guarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the
DML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML)
framework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal
convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity
conditions, where $N$ is the sample size. We apply DML-CMR to a range of
problems using DNN estimators, including IV regression and proximal causal
learning on real-world datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance
against existing CMR estimators and algorithms tailored to those problems.

Abstract: Clustering and estimating cluster means are core problems in statistics and
machine learning, with k-means and Expectation Maximization (EM) being two
widely used algorithms. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for
the failure of k-means in high-dimensional settings with high noise and limited
sample sizes, using a simple Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We identify regimes
where, with high probability, almost every partition of the data becomes a
fixed point of the k-means algorithm. This study is motivated by challenges in
the analysis of more complex cases, such as masked GMMs, and those arising from
applications in Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

Abstract: When applicants get rejected by an algorithmic decision system, recourse
explanations provide actionable suggestions for how to change their input
features to get a positive evaluation. A crucial yet overlooked phenomenon is
that recourse explanations are performative: When many applicants act according
to their recommendations, their collective behavior may change statistical
regularities in the data and, once the model is refitted, also the decision
boundary. Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own
recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of
implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In
this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse
explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse
actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on
non-causal variables. Based on our analysis, we caution against the use of
standard counterfactual explanations and causal recourse methods, and instead
advocate for recourse methods that recommend actions exclusively on causal
variables.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法难以直接建模时变概率密度，尤其是在已知初始密度的情况下，需要一种能够显式建模并高效学习的方法。

Method: 使用基于对比估计的时变二元分类器，显式建模时变概率分布，并通过梯度马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法生成新样本。

Conclusion: 该方法在时变密度估计和样本生成中表现优异，为随机过程建模和异常检测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method to learn the time-dependent probability
density of a multivariate stochastic process from sample paths, assuming that
the initial probability density is known and can be evaluated. Our method uses
a novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive
estimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between
realizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants.
Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent
probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value
of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally,
the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a
second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of
the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the
time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic
excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a
random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we
generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants.
Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the
necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit
approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through
applications in unsupervised outlier detection. Through several numerical
experiments, we show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs complex
time-dependent, multi-modal, and near-degenerate densities, scales effectively
to moderately high-dimensional problems, and reliably detects rare events among
real-world data.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了随机集成的复杂效应，拓展了对隐式正则化的理解。

Abstract: Combining randomized estimators in an ensemble, such as via random forests,
has become a fundamental technique in modern data science, but can be
computationally expensive. Furthermore, the mechanism by which this improves
predictive performance is poorly understood. We address these issues in the
context of sparse linear regression by proposing and analyzing an ensemble of
greedy forward selection estimators that are randomized by feature subsampling
-- at each iteration, the best feature is selected from within a random subset.
We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly
improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful
numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as
lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings. Next, contrary to
prevailing belief that randomized ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, we show
via numerical experiments that it can simultaneously reduce training error and
degrees of freedom, thereby shifting the entire bias-variance trade-off curve
of the base estimator. We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of
orthogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the
ordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic
weights, thereby enlarging the model search space. These results enhance our
understanding of random forests and suggest that implicit regularization in
general may have more complicated effects than explicit regularization.

TL;DR: POCO是一个统一的神经预测模型，结合轻量级单变量预测器和群体级编码器，用于捕捉神经元特异性和全脑动态，在多物种数据中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测未来神经活动是建模脑动态的核心挑战，对科学研究和闭环神经技术有重要应用。目前跨多会话、自发记录的神经预测研究不足。

Method: POCO结合单变量预测器和群体级编码器，通过五个钙成像数据集（斑马鱼、小鼠和线虫）训练，实现细胞分辨率的预测。

Result: POCO在自发行为中达到最先进的预测精度，并能快速适应新记录。其学习到的单元嵌入无需解剖标签即可恢复生物有意义的结构（如脑区聚类）。

Conclusion: POCO为跨会话神经预测提供了可扩展和适应性强的方法，并为未来模型设计提供了实用见解，为自适应神经技术和神经基础模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Predicting future neural activity is a core challenge in modeling brain
dynamics, with applications ranging from scientific investigation to
closed-loop neurotechnology. While recent models of population activity
emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural
forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains
underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a
lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture
both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium
imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors.
After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal
fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically
meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical
labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing
performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing.
Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for
cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model
design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural
dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive
neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对360度视频的超分辨率方法S3PO，解决了传统VSR技术在360度视频中的失真问题，并创建了一个新的数据集360VDS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360度视频在VR中广泛应用，但其空间分辨率有限，影响视觉质量。传统VSR技术无法解决360度视频的失真问题，且缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 提出了一种名为S3PO的深度学习模型，采用循环建模和注意力机制，设计了专门的特征提取器和损失函数以解决球形失真。

Result: S3PO在360度视频数据集上表现优于大多数传统VSR模型和360度专用超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: S3PO通过针对性设计和优化，有效提升了360度视频的超分辨率效果。

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360{\deg} videos) are widely used in Virtual
Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences.
However, the limited spatial resolution in 360{\deg} videos does not allow for
each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual
quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video
Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a
promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the
distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360{\deg} video signals.
An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360{\deg} video datasets
for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360{\deg} Video
Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models
to 360{\deg} videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model
for 360{\deg} Video Super-Resolution (360{\deg} VSR), called Spherical Signal
Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent
modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques
like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss
function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most
state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\deg}~specific
super-resolution models on 360{\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study
is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen
architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

TL;DR: CrEst是一个弱监督框架，用于评估LLM推理中上下文文档的可信度，无需人工标注，通过文档间一致性实现自动化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常忽略上下文文档可信度的差异，可能导致不可靠信息的传播。

Method: 基于文档间语义一致性自动化评估可信度，并提出黑盒和白盒两种集成策略。

Result: 在三种模型架构和五个数据集上，CrEst显著优于基线，准确率提升26.86%，F1分数提高3.49%。

Conclusion: CrEst在噪声条件下仍保持稳健性能，为可信度评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

Motivation: 探索LLM在无需修改权重的情况下精确重建文本的能力，并评估其潜在应用。

Method: 引入特殊记忆令牌，通过训练优化其嵌入，使模型能根据提示精确重建固定序列。

Result: 在英语和西班牙语数据集上，模型（包括Llama 3.1 8B）成功重建了长达240个令牌的序列。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM的有趣能力，为基于记忆的检索、压缩和可控文本生成提供了潜在应用。

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

TL;DR: PrefBERT是一种用于评估开放式生成长文本的评分模型，通过区分好坏输出的奖励机制改进GRPO训练，优于传统指标ROUGE-L和BERTScore。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估开放式长文本生成时难以全面衡量质量，存在偏见或遗漏关键方面（如连贯性、风格、相关性）。

Method: 提出PrefBERT，基于多样长文本风格和质量评分的响应评估数据集训练，为GRPO提供语义奖励反馈。

Result: PrefBERT在多句子和段落长度响应中表现可靠，与人类偏好一致，优于传统指标。

Conclusion: PrefBERT作为奖励信号训练策略模型，生成结果更符合人类偏好，代码已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在现实中的广泛应用，事后遗忘特定知识的能力变得至关重要，涉及隐私法规和纠正有害内容等问题。

Method: 通过实验研究学习时知识编码对遗忘效果的影响，比较不同学习方式（如转述描述）的遗忘性能。

Result: 发现转述描述学习能提升遗忘效果，但遗忘文本块中的单个知识仍困难。

Conclusion: 学习时的知识编码对实现可靠的事后遗忘具有重要作用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言在语言识别（LID）中表现不佳，主要由于训练数据单一（如圣经）导致的类别不平衡和偏见问题。

Method: 采用监督对比学习（SCL）方法，学习低资源语言的领域不变表示。

Result: 方法在低资源语言的域外数据上提高了LID性能3.2%。

Conclusion: SCL方法有效提升了低资源语言的LID性能，解决了数据不平衡和偏见问题。

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Result: 在数学推理、多跳问答和空间推理任务中表现优异，效率提升2.6倍。

Conclusion: SPARE在推理性能和效率上均优于基线方法，代码已开源以促进研究。

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于情感引导的双向动态交互框架（EmoBi），用于检测夸张和隐喻，通过情感分析和双向动态交互提升检测效果，实验表明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夸张和隐喻在自然语言处理中具有重要意义，但由于其语义隐晦和表达多样性，检测具有挑战性。现有方法多关注表面特征，忽略了情感关联和双向交互。

Method: EmoBi框架包含情感分析模块、基于情感的领域映射模块和双向动态交互模块，通过情感挖掘和动态交互提升检测效果。

Result: 在四个数据集上优于基线方法，TroFi数据集上夸张检测F1分数提升28.1%，HYPO-L数据集上隐喻检测提升23.1%。

Conclusion: EmoBi框架通过情感引导和双向交互显著提升了夸张和隐喻检测效果，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

Motivation: 解决自动文档理解中复杂布局、表格和图表的挑战，评估视觉语言大模型在长上下文输入中的有效性。

Method: 构建包含1,000个多选题的WikiMixQA基准，涵盖7个主题的4,000个维基百科页面，评估12种先进视觉语言模型。

Result: 专有模型在直接上下文下准确率约70%，但长文档检索时性能显著下降；开源模型最高准确率仅27%。

Conclusion: 长上下文多模态推理仍具挑战性，WikiMixQA为文档理解研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

Result: 实验成功识别了最优后悔表示层，并发现M形解耦模式及三类功能神经元。

Conclusion: 提出的方法和指标有效揭示了后悔机制，为模型可靠性研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

Conclusion: 研究表明不同模型在语音增强的不同方面各有优势，为实际应用中的权衡提供了参考，可能推动语音生物识别、法医音频分析等领域的发展。

Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the
intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications,
especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various
deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise
suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation,
leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation.
This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and
U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These
models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code
accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise
suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and
+364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality,
attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it
well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech.
Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific
feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and
+27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize
trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker
recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics,
forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in
challenging acoustic conditions.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the
creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition
and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation
process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.
Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can
drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the
application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing.
Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained
text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the
underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the
overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information,
and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen
intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a
balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the
desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the
text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's
speed.

in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these
losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be
viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust
Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2)
Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution
distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false
negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which
generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization.
DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be
demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation
accuracy and robustness.

### [150] [Context-Aware Deep Lagrangian Networks for Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15249)
*Lucas Schulze,Jan Peters,Oleg Arenz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于上下文感知的深度拉格朗日网络（DeLaN）方法，结合在线系统识别和模型预测控制（MPC），用于复杂环境中的机器人控制，显著提升了轨迹跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂环境中，全局物理模型难以应对大量不确定的物体和动态变化，因此需要开发上下文感知的局部模型，同时保持物理合理性。

Method: 扩展DeLaN为上下文感知模型，结合递归网络进行在线系统识别，并集成MPC进行自适应控制；同时引入残差动力学模型利用机器人名义模型。

Result: 在7自由度机械臂的变负载轨迹跟踪任务中，该方法将末端执行器跟踪误差降低了39%，优于基线方法的21%提升。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的DeLaN结合MPC和残差模型，显著提升了复杂环境中的机器人控制性能，验证了其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Controlling a robot based on physics-informed dynamic models, such as deep
Lagrangian networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and
interpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments,
the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical
properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a
single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system
identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant
aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation
of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility
for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable,
particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model
Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it
context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system
identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed
control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the
fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our
method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our
method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21%
improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.

*Kaifeng Zhang,Baoyu Li,Kris Hauser,Yunzhu Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合粒子与空间网格的神经动力学框架，用于建模可变形物体的动态行为，并通过实验验证其在稀疏视角下的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可变形物体的动态建模因物理属性多样性和视觉信息有限而具有挑战性，需一种高效且通用的方法。

Method: 采用粒子-网格混合表示，粒子捕捉物体形状，空间网格确保连续性；结合高斯渲染技术生成3D动作视频。

Result: 模型在稀疏视角RGB-D数据上学习多样物体动态，泛化能力强，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为可变形物体的数字孪生和任务规划提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their
diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from
limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics
framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid
representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion
information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of
objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,
while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity
and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual
rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of
deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse
objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from
sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also
generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,
particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase
the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling
goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks. The project page

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 层次图的分支结构对传统图滤波器设计提出了挑战，需要一种基于几何原理的稳定滤波器。

Method: 引入边界加权算子，利用Busemann函数在delta-双曲网络上证明其谱范数的上界。

Result: 证明了信号能量在每次传递时会损失一个曲率控制的分数，提供了一种参数无关的轻量级滤波器。

Conclusion: 该算子为具有密集或隐藏层次结构的数据提供了一种新的图信号处理工具。

Abstract: Hierarchical graphs often exhibit tree-like branching patterns, a structural
property that challenges the design of traditional graph filters. We introduce
a boundary-weighted operator that rescales each edge according to how far its
endpoints drift toward the graph's Gromov boundary. Using Busemann functions on
delta-hyperbolic networks, we prove a closed-form upper bound on the operator's
spectral norm: every signal loses a curvature-controlled fraction of its energy
at each pass. The result delivers a parameter-free, lightweight filter whose
stability follows directly from geometric first principles, offering a new
analytic tool for graph signal processing on data with dense or hidden
hierarchical structure.

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据集成框架，用于学习分数阶非线性系统的动态特性，验证了其有效性并比较了分数阶与整数阶模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分数阶非线性系统的动态特性，解决其建模和学习的挑战。

Method: 设计输入输出实验生成数据集，利用正交基函数重构向量场，并通过基准系统验证。

Result: 框架能准确学习系统动态，分数阶模型在捕捉长程依赖性上优于整数阶模型。

Conclusion: 分数阶模型更适合描述长程依赖关系，整数阶模型存在局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of
fractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time
settings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step,
input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for
learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector
field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along
with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to
estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are
then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed
approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems.
The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the
system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn
equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that
fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
the limitations of integer-order representations.

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的深度学习模型，用于预测流体注入引发的小地震（MEQs）的时空演化，以支持地热系统和碳封存等应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测小地震的时空演化对地热系统、碳封存等应用至关重要，但目前缺乏高效的方法。

Method: 采用Transformer模型，结合水力刺激历史和小地震观测数据，预测MEQ数量、地震矩及地震云范围。

Result: 模型在1秒和15秒预测范围内表现优异（R²>0.98和>0.88），并提供不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该模型能实时推断裂缝扩展和渗透率变化，为地震风险评估和缓解策略提供支持。

Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the
evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full
spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as
enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other
geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning
model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to
forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic
seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of
the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model
achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the
15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty
estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate,
uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture
propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of
deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide
mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 量子机器学习（QML）结合量子计算与机器学习，利用量子力学原理提升经典方法。研究通过评估量子神经网络（QNNs）证明其优于经典方法，并在风能数据预测中达到93%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对QML实际优势的质疑，特别是在当前NISQ设备限制下，验证QNNs的有效性。

Method: 构建并评估12种QNN配置，结合两种量子特征映射和六种纠缠策略，在风能数据集上进行实验。

Result: 使用Z特征映射的QNNs在仅四个输入参数下达到93%预测准确率，优于经典方法。

Conclusion: QNNs在预测任务中表现优异，展示了QML在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of
quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine
learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as
entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the
practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns
by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired
counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their
effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and
evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum
feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz
design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs
employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when
forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings
show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring
the potential of QML in real-world applications.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的正则化方法，用于平衡量子机器学习中电路切割带来的采样开销与模型精度之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子机器学习（QML）是否具有优势仍是一个开放性问题，而NISQ硬件的限制（如电路深度和连接性）阻碍了验证量子优势和解决诸如贫瘠高原等主要障碍。电路切割技术虽然能执行更大的电路，但增加了采样开销。

Method: 在QML优化过程中引入一种新的正则化项，直接惩罚与采样相关的开销，使优化器能够平衡电路切割的优势与典型机器学习成本函数的优化。

Result: 该方法能够有效平衡切割开销与模型精度，为研究更大复杂问题以实现量子优势铺平道路。

Conclusion: 通过正则化方法，论文为在有限硬件条件下探索量子机器学习的潜力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Whether QML can offer a transformative advantage remains an open question.
The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and
connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical
investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting
techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on
smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However,
this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the
expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to
estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel
regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the
overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables
the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the
optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the
trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall
accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in
pursuit of quantum advantage.

Abstract: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a cornerstone

application of a Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning (QMKL) framework to enhance
QSAR classification, showing a notable performance improvement over classical

numerical molecular descriptors, reducing dimensionality via Principal
Component Analysis (PCA), and employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained
on an optimized combination of multiple quantum and classical kernels. By
benchmarking the QMKL-SVM against a classical Gradient Boosting model, we show
that the quantum-enhanced approach achieves a superior AUC score, highlighting

TL;DR: 论文研究了在输入规模未知的情况下，差分隐私持续计数问题，提出了一种基于对数扰动的新型矩阵分解方法，显著降低了误差和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于矩阵机制的最优算法需要预先知道输入规模，而常见的‘倍增技巧’会导致误差不理想且不平滑。因此，需要一种无需预先知道输入规模且能保持平滑误差的算法。

Method: 引入基于对数扰动的新型矩阵分解方法，利用函数$\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$的变体，设计了一种空间和时间复杂度更优的算法。

Result: 算法在任意$t \leq n$时能以$O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$方差估计前$t$个数据点的和，空间复杂度为$O(t)$，每轮时间摊销为$O(\log t)$。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在理论和实际性能上均优于现有方法，尤其在输入规模未知的情况下表现更优。

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private continual counting in the
unbounded setting where the input size $n$ is not known in advance. Current
state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix
mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only
hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick'
avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve
this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic
perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works,
which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error,
and for any $\alpha > 0$ and $t\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum
of the first $t$ data points with $O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$ variance. It
requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\log t)$ time per round, compared to
$O(\log(n)\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \log n)$ pre-processing
time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA
2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable
to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\times$ theirs for
$t$ as large as $2^{24}$.

TL;DR: deepSURF是一个结合静态分析和LLM引导的模糊测试工具，用于检测Rust库中的内存安全漏洞，特别是在不安全代码中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在检测Rust内存漏洞时能力有限，处理Rust特有类型不足或依赖人工干预。

Method: deepSURF通过替换泛型为自定义类型并生成特制实现，结合LLM动态增强模糊测试用例，探索复杂API交互。

Result: 在27个真实Rust库中，成功重新发现20个已知漏洞和6个新漏洞，优于现有工具。

Conclusion: deepSURF显著提升了Rust内存漏洞检测能力，展示了其优于现有工具的潜力。

Abstract: Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of
unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused.
Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically
exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific
types, or rely heavily on manual intervention.
  To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates
static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness
generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust
libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel
approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and
generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the
fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library.
Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically,
facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly
increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We
evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20
known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities,
demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

Motivation: 研究如何在大型语言模型（LLM）预训练中保护数据集并追踪其使用，避免依赖记忆化方法。

Method: 使用基于梯度的优化提示调优，让模型学习训练数据中不存在的秘密序列（秘密提示和响应）。

Result: 仅需极少量（<0.005%）的投毒标记即可高置信度（p < 10^{-55}）检测秘密序列，且不影响模型基准性能。

Conclusion: 间接数据投毒是一种可行且高效的数据保护和追踪方法，无需依赖训练数据的记忆化。

Abstract: The pre-training of large language models (LLMs) relies on massive text
datasets sourced from diverse and difficult-to-curate origins. Although
membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace
data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM
providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data
poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not
only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its
use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn
arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent
from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models
pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are
sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely
high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme.
Crucially, this occurs without performance degradation (on LM benchmarks) and
despite secrets never appearing in the training set.

Abstract: The integration of AI/ML into medical devices is rapidly transforming
healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, this
advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of
complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability
with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities
in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack
surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging.
Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on
these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant
safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices
from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of
addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the
pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device
recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat
landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient
safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques
designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive
premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed
cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices,
thereby making them safe for patients.

Conclusion: CAE在复杂数据环境下表现出鲁棒性，优于CDAE和CSAE。

Abstract: In the ever-expanding domain of 5G-NR wireless cellular networks,
over-the-air jamming attacks are prevalent as security attacks, compromising
the quality of the received signal. We simulate a jamming environment by
incorporating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) into the real-world In-phase
and Quadrature (I/Q) OFDM datasets. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is
exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as
heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization
Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance.
Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by
employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB
observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of
the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models:
Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder
(CSAE). Despite the complexity of data heterogeneity involved across all
datasets, CAE depicts the robustness in detection performance of jammed signal
by achieving average values of 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08%
F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy over CDAE and CSAE.

Motivation: 解决前列腺MRI图像分割中因读者差异和跨站点数据导致的精度问题。

Method: 比较UNETR、SwinUNETR和3D UNet，采用三种训练策略（单队列、5折交叉验证、基于腺体大小的数据集），并使用Optuna调参。

Result: SwinUNETR在多种训练策略下表现最佳，Dice分数最高提升5个百分点。

Conclusion: SwinUNETR通过全局和移位窗口自注意力机制有效减少标签噪声和类别不平衡敏感性，适合临床部署。

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic
segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study
investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such
heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate
gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI
(T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training
strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed
cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The
test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation
endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2,
while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared
to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR
had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in
cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for
Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53;
Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed
poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention
effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in
improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining
computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR
for clinical deployment.

Result: 生成的3D血管模型在半径、长度和弯曲度上与真实数据高度相似，适用于医学培训和模拟。

Conclusion: RvNN首次用于血管合成，生成的模型准确且多样，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment
planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant
challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most
existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite
providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they
fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We
developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the
hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold
encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target
surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new
vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we
generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which
is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many
other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high
similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets,
including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical
data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders
(NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged
as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid
in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage
multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal
clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a
novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND
classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion
Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our
framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within
volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted
feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically
integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance.
Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate
that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy,
particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework
achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by
over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying
multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的分类模型，用于准确分类8种不同的多参数磁共振成像（mpMRI）序列类型，以提高放射科医生的工作效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于DICOM头文件中协议多样性和技术员错误导致的信息不准确，影响了mpMRI序列的分类效率。

Method: 使用ResNet、EfficientNet和DenseNet等多种深度学习分类器对8种MRI序列进行分类，并比较其性能。最佳分类器在不同训练数据量和外部数据集上的表现也被研究。

Result: DenseNet-121模型在内部和外部数据集上均表现出色，最高F1分数和准确率分别为0.966和0.972。

Conclusion: DenseNet-121模型在分类任务中表现最佳，且性能随训练数据量增加而提升，适用于不同来源的数据集。

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series
types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these
series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols
and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep
learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series
types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from
various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet,
EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and
their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is
identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different
training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the
out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using
mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and
its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121
model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the
other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than
0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose
performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the
external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and
0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and
external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of
classifying 8 body MRI series types.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的学习规则，通过扩展STDP方法同时学习突触连接强度和延迟，验证了其在SNN分类任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物神经元网络中突触延迟对学习过程至关重要，但在SNN中很少被模拟。

Method: 扩展STDP方法，同时学习突触强度和延迟，并在SNN分类任务中验证。

Result: 新方法在多种测试场景中表现优于现有方法，并揭示了突触效能与延迟的相互作用。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了SNN性能，为突触延迟的研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Synaptic delays play a crucial role in biological neuronal networks, where
their modulation has been observed in mammalian learning processes. In the
realm of neuromorphic computing, although spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to
emulate biology more closely than traditional artificial neural networks do,
synaptic delays are rarely incorporated into their simulation. We introduce a
novel learning rule for simultaneously learning synaptic connection strengths
and delays, by extending spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a Hebbian
method commonly used for learning synaptic weights. We validate our approach by
extending a widely-used SNN model for classification trained with unsupervised
learning. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method by comparing
it against another existing methods for co-learning synaptic weights and delays
as well as against STDP without synaptic delays. Results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently achieves superior performance across a variety of
test scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results yield insight into the
interplay between synaptic efficacy and delay.

Method: 集成生成流匹配模型和预测结构振动的替代模型，通过流匹配模型推动可制造性，替代模型推动低振动解决方案。

Result: 方法生成的板设计在振动减少方面优于随机搜索、基于标准的设计启发式和遗传优化。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成多样且可制造的板设计，有效减少结构振动，适用于多种优化目标。

Abstract: Structural vibrations are a source of unwanted noise in engineering systems
like cars, trains or airplanes. Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for
improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization
approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing
beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a
generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict
structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model
pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to
low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data
implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential
solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required.
We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives,
including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful
construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method
generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural
vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design
heuristic and genetic optimization. The code and data are available from
https://github.com/ecker-lab/Optimizing_Vibrating_Plates.

The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA

Conclusion: ICL是一种高效且原则性的无线接收器自适应方法，适用于动态信道环境。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless
receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge
traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware
architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically
adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies,
including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either
demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through
gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques
rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review
architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured
state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence
models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we
explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing
both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that
ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver
adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without
requiring online retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏信号恢复中变量自动分组的挑战，通过排序非凸惩罚减少系数收缩并促进变量聚类。

Method: 使用排序非凸惩罚（如SLOPE的推广形式），分为弱凸和非凸两种情况，分别利用PAV算法及其改进版本计算近端算子。

Result: 在弱凸情况下（如sorted MCP和SCAD），PAV算法能精确计算近端算子；在非凸情况下（如sorted Lq），改进的PAV算法高效。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在实验中展示了实用价值，为稀疏信号恢复和变量分组提供了新工具。

Abstract: This work studies the problem of sparse signal recovery with automatic
grouping of variables. To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties
as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a
family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm
(SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to
their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of
coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal
operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite
optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish
between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the
proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where
computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial
problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how
the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal
operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that
a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to
tackle the computation of the proximal operator. We also present new
theoretical insights on the minimizers of the nonconvex proximal problem. We
demonstrate the practical interest of using such penalties on several
experiments.

Motivation: 解决分布式优化中通信轮次多、灵活性不足的问题，同时利用目标函数的相似性提高效率。

Method: 基于块可分解的原始-对偶形式化和多时间尺度滑动方法，不同对偶块以不同速率更新。

Result: MT-GS和AMT-GS在通信轮次和次梯度步骤上达到最优依赖性，且线性依赖性是理论最优的。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在非光滑目标下实现了最优通信轮次依赖，回答了开放性问题。

Abstract: We propose two first-order methods for convex, non-smooth, distributed
optimization problems, hereafter called Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding
(MT-GS) and its accelerated variant (AMT-GS). Our MT-GS and AMT-GS can take
advantage of similarities between (local) objectives to reduce the
communication rounds, are flexible so that different subsets (of agents) can
communicate at different, user-picked rates, and are fully deterministic. These
three desirable features are achieved through a block-decomposable primal-dual
formulation, and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method introduced in
Lan et al. (2020), Lan (2016), where different dual blocks are updated at
potentially different rates.
  To find an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution, the complexities of our algorithms
achieve optimal dependency on $\epsilon$: MT-GS needs
$O(\overline{r}A/\epsilon)$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/\epsilon^2)$ subgradient steps for Lipchitz objectives, and
AMT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu})$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/(\epsilon\mu))$ subgradient steps if the objectives are also
$\mu$-strongly convex. Here, $\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of
updates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients
of) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds
on $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive
answer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for
non-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).

Abstract: Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a
multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance
loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to
be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive
masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model
efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse
multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically
adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network
structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when
targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR
Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a
single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network
initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3为3D生成模型提供了一种高效且样本利用率高的对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.

Abstract: Ferry quays experience rapid deterioration due to their exposure to harsh
maritime environments and ferry impacts. Vibration-based structural health
monitoring offers a valuable approach to assessing structural integrity and
understanding the structural implications of these impacts. However, practical
limitations often restrict sensor placement at critical locations.
Consequently, virtual sensing techniques become essential for establishing a
Digital Twin and estimating the structural response. This study investigates
the application of the Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) for virtual
sensing on the Magerholm ferry quay, combining in-operation experimental data
collected during a ferry impact with a detailed physics-based model. The
proposed Physics-Encoded Machine Learning model integrates a reduced-order
structural model with a data-driven GPLFM representing the unknown impact
forces via their modal contributions. Significant challenges are addressed for
the development of the Digital Twin of the ferry quay, including unknown impact
characteristics (location, direction, intensity), time-varying boundary
conditions, and sparse sensor configurations. Results show that the GPLFM
provides accurate acceleration response estimates at most locations, even under
simplifying modeling assumptions such as linear time-invariant behavior during
the impact phase. Lower accuracy was observed at locations in the impact zone.
A numerical study was conducted to explore an optimal real-world sensor
placement strategy using a Backward Sequential Sensor Placement approach.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of sensor types,
sampling frequencies, and incorrectly assumed damping ratios. The results
suggest that the GP latent forces can help accommodate modeling and measurement
uncertainties, maintaining acceptable estimation accuracy across scenarios.

Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在关键决策中的应用增加，对易于理解的解释需求日益增长。现有XAI评估常忽视认知可访问性，尤其是对视觉障碍用户。

Method: 提出CUE模型，将解释属性与认知子过程（可读性、可理解性、可解释性）关联，并通过实验（N=455）测试不同热图颜色映射的效果。

Result: 实验发现视觉障碍用户的任务表现与常人相当，但信心和努力程度较低，且某些专为无障碍设计的颜色映射（如Cividis）未能改善甚至加剧了差距。

Conclusion: 结果验证了CUE模型，表明解释的可读性影响理解性，并呼吁开发自适应、用户定制的XAI界面。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly inform critical decisions, the need
for human-understandable explanations grows. Current evaluations of Explainable
AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which
critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We
propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking
explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception),
readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study
(N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we
found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually
impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes
worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results
challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for
adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering
explanation legibility affects understandability. We contribute: (1) a
formalized cognitive model for explanation understanding, (2) an integrated
definition of human-centered explanation properties, and (3) empirical evidence
motivating accessible, user-tailored XAI.

Abstract: This article introduces WebXAII, an open-source web framework designed to
facilitate research on human interaction with eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) systems. The field of XAI is rapidly expanding, driven by
the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in
particular machine learning) across diverse applications. Researchers who study
the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc
interfaces in order to conduct their studies. These interfaces are usually not
shared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and
the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement
WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols,
meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants
and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a
composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of
flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so
that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We
demonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by
reproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature. The
framework is available at https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII.

Motivation: 探讨AI生成的性别和年龄分布数据对公众的实际用处和可信度，填补了过去研究中缺乏受众参与的问题。

Method: 使用CLIP模型分析视觉数据，设计可视化工具，并通过用户研究评估其效果。

Result: 用户认为工具总体有用，但信任度中等偏低，建议增加更多人口统计类别和上下文信息。

Conclusion: 工具在展示角色代表性方面有效，但需改进以提升用户信任和满足更多需求。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI has enabled automated analysis of complex media content
at scale and generate actionable insights regarding character representation
along such dimensions as gender and age. Past work focused on quantifying
representation from audio/video/text using various ML models, but without
having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along
demographic dimensions are available, how useful are they to the general
public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work
addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based
character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the
Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze
visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of
age and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for
presenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to
seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the
AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our
visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics
from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also
indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic
categories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in
AI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they
were not against the use of AI in this context. Our tool including code,
benchmarking, and data from the user study can be found here:

Motivation: 传统调查问卷生成需要大量人力和专业知识，而LLM的出现为自动化这一过程提供了新机会，旨在提高效率并保持质量。

Method: 部署了一个基于LLM的系统，结合DeLone和McLean的IS成功模型进行评估，并提出混合评估框架和安全措施。

Result: 研究表明，LLM可以有效地加速数据收集，同时通过混合评估框架和安全措施确保质量。

Conclusion: LLM在调查问卷生成中具有潜力，但需结合评估框架和安全措施以确保实际应用中的可靠性和责任性。

Abstract: Surveys are a cornerstone of Information Systems (IS) research, yet creating
high-quality surveys remains labor-intensive, requiring both domain expertise
and methodological rigor. With the evolution of large language models (LLMs),
new opportunities emerge to automate survey generation. This paper presents the
real-world deployment of an LLM-powered system designed to accelerate data
collection while maintaining survey quality. Deploying such systems in
production introduces real-world complexity, including diverse user needs and
quality control. We evaluate the system using the DeLone and McLean IS Success
Model to understand how generative AI can reshape a core IS method. This study
makes three key contributions. To our knowledge, this is the first application
of the IS Success Model to a generative AI system for survey creation. In
addition, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework combining automated and
human assessments. Finally, we implement safeguards that mitigate
post-deployment risks and support responsible integration into IS workflows.

Motivation: 由于DR可视化分析中存在固有失真等问题，文献中提出了多种方法以提高其可靠性，但文献的多样性和广泛性使新手难以入门。

Method: 基于对相关文献的分类，提出了一个指南，帮助用户评估DR专业知识并选择适合的文献。

Result: 通过与三位DR和数据可视化专家的访谈研究，验证了指南的重要性、全面性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该指南为新手提供了有效的学习路径，有助于提升DR可视化分析的可靠性。

Abstract: Visual analytics using dimensionality reduction (DR) can easily be unreliable
for various reasons, e.g., inherent distortions in representing the original
data. The literature has thus proposed a wide range of methodologies to make
DR-based visual analytics reliable. However, the diversity and extensiveness of
the literature can leave novice analysts and researchers uncertain about where
to begin and proceed. To address this problem, we propose a guide for reading
papers for reliable visual analytics with DR. Relying on the previous
classification of the relevant literature, our guide helps both practitioners
to (1) assess their current DR expertise and (2) identify papers that will
further enhance their understanding. Interview studies with three experts in DR
and data visualizations validate the significance, comprehensiveness, and
usefulness of our guide.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了AI4SI项目在实现实际社会影响时面临的多重挑战，并提出了应对策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI4SI项目在解决社会问题方面潜力巨大，但许多项目难以超越概念验证阶段，且其挑战未得到充分认可。

Method: 通过半结构化访谈和作者自身经验，分析AI4SI研究中的日常困难，并进行主题分析。

Result: 识别出结构性和组织性、沟通、协作及运营挑战是主要障碍，并提出了最佳实践和策略。

Abstract: In an attempt to tackle the UN SDGs, AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects
focus on harnessing AI to address societal issues in areas such as healthcare,
social justice, etc. Unfortunately, despite growing interest in AI4SI,
achieving tangible, on-the-ground impact remains a significant challenge. For
example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to
co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often
difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects
"fail" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to
transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique
challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within
the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily
applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized
in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse
challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that
prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground.
Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers -
complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research
- this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in
developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic
analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication,
collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While
there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies
drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space. In doing so, we
hope this paper serves as a practical reference guide for AI4SI researchers and
partner organizations seeking to engage more effectively in socially impactful
AI collaborations.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“共创学习”的新范式，通过人类与AI的互动整合部分感知信息与知识，构建共享的外部表征（符号涌现）。实验基于Metropolis-Hastings命名游戏（MHNG），结果显示MH-based AI显著提升了分类准确性和符号共享系统的收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统AI教学中单向知识传递的局限性，探索如何整合不同模态的信息，实现人类与AI的协同学习。

Method: 采用基于Metropolis-Hastings命名游戏（MHNG）的人机交互模型，通过在线实验（69名参与者）测试三种AI代理类型（MH-based、always-accept、always-reject）在部分可观测性下的表现。

Result: MH-based AI显著提升了分类准确性，并促进了共享符号系统的收敛；人类接受行为与MHNG的概率模型高度一致。

Conclusion: 共创学习通过MHNG交互在人机对中首次实证实现，为构建动态对齐感知体验的共生AI系统提供了新路径。

Abstract: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI,
i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial
perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external
representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional
AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the
challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We
empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the
Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference
mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention
naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,
always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that
human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization
accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared
sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the
MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical
evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based
interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that
learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual
experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对大型语言模型（LLMs）的数据中心架构协同设计框架，探索了计算、带宽、网络拓扑等因素对性能的影响，并验证了FullFlat网络架构的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs（如GPT-4）参数规模的爆炸式增长，传统数据中心架构难以满足其扩展性、效率和成本效益的需求。

Method: 通过协同设计框架，研究计算能力（FLOPS）、HBM带宽和容量、网络拓扑（如FullFlat光学网络）、扩展域规模及并行化策略对LLMs性能的影响。

Result: FullFlat网络架构显著提升了性能和扩展性；硬件加速集合操作、更大扩展域和内存容量进一步优化了性能。

Conclusion: 研究为支持万亿参数模型的高效AI数据中心设计提供了实用路线图，降低了优化复杂度。

Abstract: The explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) - such as GPT-4 with 1.8
trillion parameters - demands a radical rethinking of data center architecture
to ensure scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our work provides a
comprehensive co-design framework that jointly explores FLOPS, HBM bandwidth
and capacity, multiple network topologies (two-tier vs. FullFlat optical), the
size of the scale-out domain, and popular parallelism/optimization strategies
used in LLMs. We introduce and evaluate FullFlat network architectures, which
provide uniform high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity between all nodes, and
demonstrate their transformative impact on performance and scalability. Through
detailed sensitivity analyses, we quantify the benefits of overlapping compute
and communication, leveraging hardware-accelerated collectives, wider scale-out
domains, and larger memory capacity. Our study spans both sparse (mixture of
experts) and dense transformer-based LLMs, revealing how system design choices
affect Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU = Model flops per token x Observed tokens
per sec / Peak flops of the hardware) and overall throughput. For the co-design
study, we extended and validated a performance modeling tool capable of
predicting LLM runtime within 10% of real-world measurements. Our findings
offer actionable insights and a practical roadmap for designing AI data centers
that can efficiently support trillion-parameter models, reduce optimization
complexity, and sustain the rapid evolution of AI capabilities.
