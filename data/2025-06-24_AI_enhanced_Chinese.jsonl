Context is derived by aggregating and\ninferring from dynamic IoT data, making it highly volatile and posing\nchallenges in maintaining freshness and real-time accessibility. Caching is a\npotential solution, but traditional policies struggle with the transient nature\nof context in IoT (e.g., ensuring real-time access for frequent queries or\nhandling fast-changing data). To address this, we propose the Dynamic Context\nMonitoring Framework (DCMF) to enhance context caching in Context Management\nPlatforms (CMPs) by dynamically evaluating and managing context. DCMF comprises\ntwo core components: the Context Evaluation Engine (CEE) and the Context\nManagement Module (CMM). The CEE calculates the Probability of Access (PoA)\nusing parameters such as Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Context (QoC),\nCost of Context (CoC), timeliness, and Service Level Agreements (SLAs),\nassigning weights to assess access likelihood. Based on this, the CMM applies a\nhybrid Dempster-Shafer approach to manage Context Freshness (CF), updating\nbelief levels and confidence scores to determine whether to cache, evict, or\nrefresh context items. We implemented DCMF in a Context-as-a-Service (CoaaS)\nplatform and evaluated it using real-world smart city data, particularly\ntraffic and roadwork scenarios. Results show DCMF achieves a 12.5% higher cache\nhit rate and reduces cache expiry by up to 60% compared to the m-CAC technique,\nensuring timely delivery of relevant context and reduced latency.

This paper\nintroduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework\ndesigned to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in\nMAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic\nvoting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the\nrelevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational\ncontext; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing\nimportance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different\ntime horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based\nconsensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items\nare agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in\nthe presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N\ngreater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient\ninter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage\nand similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations\nin a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's\nefficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%\nvoting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a\n92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an\n82% cache hit rate for memory access.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCo-Forgetting Protocol\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u540c\u6b65\u4fee\u526a\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u65f6\u6216\u65e0\u5173\u6570\u636e\u7684\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002", "method": "\u534f\u8bae\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\u6295\u7968\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u8870\u51cf\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u57fa\u4e8ePBFT\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u3001\u6295\u7968\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5171\u8bc6\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "Co-Forgetting Protocol\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u4fee\u526a\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

It should support federated training across sovereign\noperators, offer integration hooks into existing OSS and BSS systems, and\ncomply with TM Forum and O-RAN standards.

However, as the NFV\ninfrastructure is shared by virtual network functions (VNFs), sporadic resource\ncontentions are inevitable. Such contention makes it extremely challenging to\nguarantee the performance of the provisioned network services, especially in\nhigh-speed regimes (e.g., Gigabit Ethernet). Existing solutions typically rely\non direct traffic analysis (e.g., packet- or flow-level measurements) to detect\nperformance degradation and identify bottlenecks, which is not always\napplicable due to significant integration overhead and system-level\nconstraints.\n  This paper complements existing solutions with a lightweight, non-intrusive\nframework for online performance inference and adaptation.

We introduce two problems related to the notion of context: (1)\nthe Contextual Pattern Mining (CPM) problem, which given $T$, $(m,l,r)$, and an\ninteger $\\tau>0$, asks for outputting the context of each substring $P$ of\nlength $m$ of $T$, provided that the size of the context of $P$ is at least\n$\\tau$; and (2) the Contextual Pattern Counting (CPC) problem, which asks for\npreprocessing $T$ so that the size of the context of a given query string $P$\nof length $m$ can be found efficiently.\n  For CPM, we propose a linear-work algorithm that either uses only internal\nmemory, or a bounded amount of internal memory and external memory, which\nallows much larger datasets to be handled. For CPC, we propose an\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n)$-space index that can be constructed in\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}n)$ time and answers queries in\n$\\mathcal{O}(m)+\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1)$ time. We further improve the\npractical performance of the CPC index by optimizations that exploit the LZ77\nfactorization of $T$ and an upper bound on the query length. Using\nbillion-letter datasets from different domains, we show that the external\nmemory version of our CPM algorithm can deal with very large datasets using a\nsmall amount of internal memory while its runtime is comparable to that of the\ninternal memory version. Interestingly, we also show that our optimized index\nfor CPC outperforms an approach based on the state of the art for the reporting\nversion of CPC [Navarro, SPIRE 2020] in terms of query time, index size,\nconstruction time, and construction space, often by more than an order of\nmagnitude.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0e\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08CPM\u548cCPC\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u957f\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6316\u6398\u548c\u8ba1\u6570\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e8eCPM\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ebf\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5185\u90e8\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u5185\u5b58\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8eCPC\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528LZ77\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u9650\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCPM\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0cCPC\u7d22\u5f15\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7d22\u5f15\u5927\u5c0f\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7d22\u5f15\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Experiments conducted\non a real-world recommendation dataset in a simulated service environment\ndemonstrate that our proposed hybrid parallelism scheme increases training\nthroughput by over 30% and improves resource utilization by approximately 20%\ncompared to traditional single-mode parallelism, while maintaining strong\nscalability and robustness.

These benchmarks evaluate the performance of LLMs on specific\ncode-related tasks, such as code understanding and generation. A critical step\nin constructing code benchmarks is the design of prompts. However, as existing\ncode benchmarks typically rely on a single prompt template per task, they are\nprone to the issue of prompt sensitivity, where minor prompt variations could\nresult in substantial performance variations, leading to unreliable evaluations\nof model capabilities.\n  While previous studies have explored prompt sensitivity, their experimental\ndesigns and findings are limited to traditional natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present an empirical study to investigate prompt\nsensitivity in code benchmarks. We first propose a general framework that\nmodifies prompt templates in a manner that preserves both their semantics and\ntheir structure as much as possible. Based on the framework, we conduct\nextensive experiments across eight code benchmark tasks on 10 representative\nopen-source LLMs, with each task featuring 100 semantically similar prompt\ntemplates. We then analyze the evaluation results using various statistical\nmetrics, focusing on both absolute and relative model performance. Our findings\nsuggest that even slight prompt variations can lead to significant shifts in\nperformance.

However, automating these interactive features for\ntesting is fraught with challenges, owing to their inherent need for timely,\ndynamic, and collaborative user interactions, which current automated testing\nmethods inadequately address.

Specifically, MAdroid\nemploys two functional types of multi-agents: user agents (Operator) and\nsupervisor agents (Coordinator and Observer).

Many providers are now operating compute\nnodes in microgrids, close to renewable power generators and energy storage, to\nmaintain full control over the cost and origin of consumed electricity.\nRecently, new co-simulation testbeds have emerged that integrate\ndomain-specific simulators to support research, development, and testing of\nsuch systems in a controlled environment. Yet, choosing an appropriate battery\nmodel for data center simulations remains challenging, as it requires balancing\nsimulation speed, realism, and ease of configuration.\n  In this paper, we implement four different battery models for data center\nscenarios within the co-simulation framework Vessim and analyze their behavior.\nThe results show that linear models, which consider inefficiencies and power\nlimits, closely match the behavior of complex physics-based models in\nshort-term experiments while offering faster execution, and not requiring\nknowledge on electrochemical reactions and circuit-level dynamics. In contrast,\nsimple, lossless models fail to accurately represent complex behavior and\nprovide no further runtime advantage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u6c60\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728Vessim\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u52a0\u5f3a\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u800c\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7535\u6c60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6a21\u62df\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5728Vessim\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u7535\u6c60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u96be\u6613\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u8fd1\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b\u800c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002"}}

While\nspecialized network infrastructure (e.g., time-sensitive networking (TSN)\nswitches) provides deterministic data transport across the network, achieving\nstrict end-to-end timing guarantees requires equally capable end devices to\nsupport deterministic traffic. These end devices, however, often employ\ngeneral-purpose computing platforms like standard PCs, which lack native\nsupport for deterministic traffic and suffer from unpredictable delays\nintroduced by their software stack and system architecture. Although\nspecialized NICs with hardware scheduling offload can mitigate this problem,\nthe limited compatibility hinders their widespread adoption, particularly for\ncost-sensitive applications or in legacy devices.\n  To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel software-based driver model,\nnamely KeepON, to enable the support of deterministic packet transmissions on\nend devices equipped with standard NICs. The key idea of KeepON is to have the\nNIC keep on transmitting fixed-size data chunks as placeholders, thereby\nmaintaining a predictable temporal transmission pattern. The real-time packets\ngenerated by the mission-critical application(s) will then be precisely\ninserted into this stream by replacing placeholders at the designated position\nto ensure their accurate transmission time.

In this study, we revisit the defect\ndetection ability of existing mutation-based testing methods and investigate\nthe factors that influence their effectiveness. To begin with, we reviewed\nexisting methods and observed that many of them mutate DL models (e.g.,\nchanging their parameters) without any customization, ignoring the unique\nchallenges in framework testing. Another issue with these methods is their\nlimited effectiveness, characterized by a high rate of false positives caused\nby illegal mutations arising from the use of generic, non-customized mutation\noperators. Moreover, we tracked the defects identified by these methods and\ndiscovered that most of them were ignored by developers. Motivated by these\nobservations, we investigate the effectiveness of existing mutation-based\ntesting methods in detecting important defects that have been authenticated by\nframework developers. We begin by collecting defect reports from three popular\nframeworks and classifying them based on framework developers' ratings to build\na comprehensive dataset.

However, existing solutions fail to yield interpretable adversarial\nexamples due to their poor sparsity. Worse still, they often struggle with\nheavy computational overhead, poor transferability, and weak attack strength.\nIn this paper, we aim to develop a sparse attack for understanding the\nvulnerability of CNNs by minimizing the magnitude of initial perturbations\nunder the l0 constraint, to overcome the existing drawbacks while achieving a\nfast, transferable, and strong attack to DNNs. In particular, a novel and\ntheoretical sound parameterization technique is introduced to approximate the\nNP-hard l0 optimization problem, making directly optimizing sparse\nperturbations computationally feasible. Besides, a novel loss function is\ndesigned to augment initial perturbations by maximizing the adversary property\nand minimizing the number of perturbed pixels simultaneously. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted to demonstrate that our approach, with theoretical\nperformance guarantees, outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attacks in terms of\ncomputational overhead, transferability, and attack strength, expecting to\nserve as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of DNNs.

Unlocking the Power of Feedback-Driven Deep Learning Framework Fuzzing via LLMs", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Infrastructures, represented by Deep Learning\n(DL) frameworks, have served as fundamental DL systems over the last decade.\nHowever, the bugs in DL frameworks could lead to catastrophic consequences in\nsome critical scenarios (e.g., healthcare and autonomous driving). A simple yet\neffective way to find bugs in DL frameworks is fuzz testing (Fuzzing).\nUnfortunately, existing fuzzing techniques have not comprehensively considered\nmultiple types of feedback. Additionally, they analyze feedback in a\ncoarse-grained manner, such as mutating the test cases only according to\nwhether the coverage increases. Recently, researchers introduced Large Language\nModels (LLMs) into fuzzing. However, current LLM-based fuzzing techniques only\nfocus on using LLMs to generate test cases while overlooking their potential to\nanalyze feedback information, failing to create more valid and diverse test\ncases. To fill this gap, we propose FUEL to break the seal of Feedback-driven\nfuzzing for DL frameworks. The backbone of FUEL comprises two LLM-based agents,\nnamely analysis LLM and generation LLM. Analysis LLM agent infers analysis\nsummaries from feedback information, while the generation LLM agent creates\ntests guided by these analysis summaries. So far, FUEL has detected 104 bugs\nfor PyTorch and TensorFlow, with 93 confirmed as new bugs, 47 already fixed,\nand 5 assigned with CVE IDs. Our work indicates that considering multiple types\nof feedback is beneficial to fuzzing performance, and leveraging LLMs to\nanalyze feedback information is a promising direction.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel problem: Sample Scheduling for DPO, which aims to dynamically\nand adaptively schedule training samples based on the model's evolving states\nthroughout preference optimization. To solve this problem, we propose SamS, an\nefficient and effective algorithm that adaptively selects samples in each\ntraining batch based on the LLM's learning feedback to maximize the potential\ngeneralization performance. Notably, without modifying the core DPO algorithm,\nsimply integrating SamS significantly improves performance across tasks, with\nminimal additional computational overhead.

Research efforts have been dedicated\nto improving different aspects of FL, such as algorithm improvement, resource\nallocation, and client selection, to enable its deployment in distributed edge\nnetworks for practical applications. One of the reasons for the poor FL model\nperformance is due to the worker dropout during training as the FL server may\nbe located far away from the FL workers. To address this issue, an Hierarchical\nFederated Learning (HFL) framework has been introduced, incorporating an\nadditional layer of edge servers to relay communication between the FL server\nand workers. While the HFL framework improves the communication between the FL\nserver and workers, large number of communication rounds may still be required\nfor model convergence, particularly when FL workers have non-independent and\nidentically distributed (non-IID) data. Moreover, the FL workers are assumed to\nfully cooperate in the FL training process, which may not always be true in\npractical situations. To overcome these challenges, we propose a\nsynthetic-data-empowered HFL framework that mitigates the statistical issues\narising from non-IID local datasets while also incentivizing FL worker\nparticipation. In our proposed framework, the edge servers reward the FL\nworkers in their clusters for facilitating the FL training process. To improve\nthe performance of the FL model given the non-IID local datasets of the FL\nworkers, the edge servers generate and distribute synthetic datasets to FL\nworkers within their clusters. FL workers determine which edge server to\nassociate with, considering the computational resources required to train on\nboth their local datasets and the synthetic datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08HFL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff08non-IID\uff09\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5de5\u4eba\u9000\u51fa\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5c42\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u5206\u53d1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u975eIID\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u6fc0\u52b1\u5de5\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6b21\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5de5\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aFL\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4f4e\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Prior work of Hajek, Wu, and Xu proposed an\nSDP (sym-SDP) for the symmetric case where the intra-community edge\nprobabilities are equal, and showed that the SDP achieves the\ninformation-theoretic threshold for exact recovery under the symmetry\nassumption. A key open question is whether SDPs can be used to achieve exact\nrecovery for non-symmetric block models. In order to inform the design of a new\nSDP for the non-symmetric setting, we investigate the failure of sym-SDP when\nit is applied to non-symmetric settings.

The ONH of one eye was imaged\nunder two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated\nto ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects\ninto four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects:\n(1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full\nsuperior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124).\nAutomatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to\ncompute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains.\nBiomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning\nmodel. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal\nstep, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect.

In particular,\nreachability analysis is increasingly used in Open-Source Software (OSS)\nprojects to identify reachable vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) through call\ngraphs, enabling a focus on exploitable risks. Performing reachability analysis\ntypically requires the vulnerable function (VF) to track the call chains from\ndownstream applications.

However, due to hard-to-analyze language features,\nexisting call graph construction algorithms for JavaScript are neither sound\nnor complete. Prior work shows that even advanced solutions produce false edges\nand miss valid ones. In this work, we assist these tools by identifying missed\ncall edges. Our main idea is to frame the problem as link prediction on full\nprogram graphs, using a rich representation with multiple edge types. Our\napproach, GRAPHIA, leverages recent advances in graph neural networks to model\nnon-local relationships between code elements. Concretely, we propose\nrepresenting JavaScript programs using a combination of syntactic- and\nsemantic-based edges. GRAPHIA can learn from imperfect labels, including static\ncall edges from existing tools and dynamic edges from tests, either from the\nsame or different projects. Because call graphs are sparse, standard machine\nlearning metrics like ROC are not suitable. Instead, we evaluate GRAPHIA by\nranking function definitions for each unresolved call site. We conduct a\nlarge-scale evaluation on 50 popular JavaScript libraries with 163K call edges\n(150K static and 13K dynamic). GRAPHIA builds program graphs with 6.6M\nstructural and 386K semantic edges. It ranks the correct target as the top\ncandidate in over 42% of unresolved cases and within the top 5 in 72% of cases,\nreducing the manual effort needed for analysis.

However, existing dynamic/mixed precision\nquantization requires retraining or special hardware, whereas post-training\nquantization (PTQ) has two limitations for resource adaptation: (i) The\nstate-of-the-art PTQ methods only provide one fixed bitwidth model, which makes\nit challenging to adapt to the dynamic resources of IoT devices; (ii) Deploying\nmultiple PTQ models with diverse bitwidths consumes large storage resources and\nswitching overheads. To this end, this paper introduces a resource-friendly\npost-training integer-nesting quantization, i.e., NestQuant, for on-device\nquantized model switching on IoT devices. The proposed NestQuant incorporates\nthe integer weight decomposition, which bit-wise splits quantized weights into\nhigher-bit and lower-bit weights of integer data types. It also contains a\ndecomposed weights nesting mechanism to optimize the higher-bit weights by\nadaptive rounding and nest them into the original quantized weights. In\ndeployment, we can send and store only one NestQuant model and switch between\nthe full-bit/part-bit model by paging in/out lower-bit weights to adapt to\nresource changes and reduce consumption. Experimental results on the\nImageNet-1K pretrained DNNs demonstrated that the NestQuant model can achieve\nhigh performance in top-1 accuracy, and reduce in terms of data transmission,\nstorage consumption, and switching overheads. In particular, the ResNet-101\nwith INT8 nesting INT6 can achieve 78.1% and 77.9% accuracy for full-bit and\npart-bit models, respectively, and reduce switching overheads by approximately\n78.1% compared with diverse bitwidths PTQ models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNestQuant\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u53cb\u597d\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001/\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u7279\u6b8a\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u800c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\uff08PTQ\uff09\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "NestQuant\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u6570\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5d4c\u5957\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u91cf\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4f4e\u4f4d\u6574\u6570\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u820d\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u4f4d\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u53ea\u9700\u5b58\u50a8\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5207\u6362\u4f4e\u4f4d\u6743\u91cd\u9002\u5e94\u8d44\u6e90\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet-1K\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3DNN\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNestQuant\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u5207\u6362\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0cResNet-101\u5728INT8\u5d4c\u5957INT6\u65f6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a78.1%\u548c77.9%\uff0c\u5207\u6362\u5f00\u9500\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea678.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "NestQuant\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In order to solve this problem, this\npaper proposes an intelligent log processing and automatic debugging framework\nbased on Large Language Model (LLM), named Intelligent Debugger (LLM-ID). This\nmethod is extended on the basis of the existing pre-trained Transformer model,\nand integrates a multi-stage semantic inference mechanism to realize the\ncontext understanding of system logs and the automatic reconstruction of fault\nchains. Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised\nclustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and\nsemantic schema. Subsequently, the fine-tuned LLM combined with the multi-round\nattention mechanism to perform contextual reasoning on the log sequence to\ngenerate potential fault assumptions and root cause paths. Furthermore, this\npaper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,\nwhich is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic\ndecision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment. Compared with\nthe existing rule engine or traditional log analysis system, the proposed model\nhas stronger semantic understanding ability, continuous learning ability and\nheterogeneous environment adaptability.

This paper introduces Property-Generated\nSolver, a novel framework that leverages Property-Based Testing (PBT) to\nvalidate high-level program properties or invariants, instead of relying on\nspecific input-output examples. These properties are often simpler to define\nand verify than directly predicting exhaustive test oracles, breaking the\n\"cycle of self-deception\" where tests might share flaws with the code they are\nmeant to validate. Property-Generated Solver employs two collaborative\nLLM-based agents: a Generator dedicated to code generation and iterative\nrefinement, and a Tester that manages the PBT life-cycle and formulate\nsemantically rich feedback from property violations.

Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities\nby generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen\nfeatures. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP,\nsolely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior\nknowledge.

The\nscore matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for\nunderstanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain\nplausible while differing significantly from their training images. In\nparticular, as explained in (Kamb \\& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,\n(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we\nwould only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.\nHowever, as shown by Kamb \\& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the\nscore is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself\n(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples\nthat globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise\n`mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role\nof self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in\nthis direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose\nscore is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer.

A typical scenario involves scammers deploying\nhoneypot contracts to attract investments, restricting token sales, and\ndraining the funds, which leaves investors with worthless tokens. Current\nmethods either rely on predefined patterns to detect code risks or utilize\nstatistical transaction data to train detection models. However, real-world Rug\nPull schemes often involve a complex interplay between malicious code and\nsuspicious transaction behaviors. These methods, which solely focus on one\naspect, fall short in detecting such schemes effectively.\n  In this paper, we propose RPhunter, a novel technique that integrates code\nand transaction for Rug Pull detection. First, RPhunter establishes declarative\nrules and performs flow analysis to extract code risk information, further\nconstructing a semantic risk code graph (SRCG). Meanwhile, to leverage\ntransaction information, RPhunter formulates dynamic token transaction\nactivities as a token flow behavior graph (TFBG) in which nodes and edges are\ncharacterized from network structure and market manipulation perspectives.\nFinally, RPhunter employs graph neural networks to extract complementary\nfeatures from SRCG and TFBG, integrating them through an attention fusion model\nto enhance the detection of Rug Pull.

To address\nconcerns around privacy, latency, and model customization, many enterprises opt\nto self-host these models. However, the diversity and growing number of\nCodeLLMs, coupled with limited accelerator memory, introduce practical\nchallenges in model management and serving efficiency. This paper presents\nCACE, a novel context-aware model eviction strategy designed specifically to\noptimize self-hosted CodeLLM serving under resource constraints. Unlike\ntraditional eviction strategies based solely on recency (e.g., Least Recently\nUsed), CACE leverages multiple context-aware factors, including model load\ntime, task-specific latency sensitivity, expected output length, and recent\nusage and future demand tracked through a sliding window.

Meanwhile, with the development of artificial\nintelligence, its application in rectal cancer treatment is becoming possible.\nIn this paper, a multi-view rectal cancer dataset is first constructed to give\na more comprehensive view of patients, including the high-resolution MRI image\nview, pressed-fat MRI image view, and clinical data view. Then, an\ninterpretable incomplete multi-view surgical evaluation model is proposed,\nconsidering that it is hard to obtain extensive and complete patient data in\nreal application scenarios. Specifically, a dual representation incomplete\nmulti-view learning model is first proposed to extract the common information\nbetween views and specific information in each view. In this model, the missing\nview imputation is integrated into representation learning, and second-order\nsimilarity constraint is also introduced to improve the cooperative learning\nbetween these two parts. Then, based on the imputed multi-view data and the\nlearned dual representation, a multi-view surgical evaluation model with the\nTSK fuzzy system is proposed.

While existing studies\nprimarily attribute the over-smoothing to repeated applications of graph\nLaplacian operators, our empirical analysis reveals a critical yet overlooked\nfactor: trainable linear transformations in GCNs significantly exacerbate\nfeature collapse, even at moderate depths (e.g., 8 layers). In contrast,\nSimplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations,\nmaintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear\ntransformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing\nover-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the\nmodel's expressive capacity.\n  To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT), a\nnovel training strategy that progressively builds deep GCNs while preserving\ntheir expressiveness. LGT integrates three complementary components: (1)\nlayer-wise training to stabilize optimization from shallow to deep layers, (2)\nlow-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow layers and accelerate training, and\n(3) identity initialization to ensure smooth integration of new layers and\naccelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, significantly\nimproving accuracy even in 32-layer settings.

Building on these\ninsights, we propose to examine the feasibility of efficiency attacks on modern\nDDLSs and develop targeted defenses to preserve robustness under adversarial\nconditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u52a8\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08DDLSs\uff09\u56e0\u5176\u8f93\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u800c\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5982\u6548\u7387\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5982\u6548\u7387\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "\u8c03\u67e5\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793aDDLSs\u7684\u6548\u7387\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u4ee3DDLSs\u7684\u6548\u7387\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

Adopting the lens of rational analysis from\ncognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal\nadaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical\nBayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token\npredictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under\nthis framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior\nprobability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a\nposterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework\ndraws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make\nexplicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:\nbeyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing\na strategy is dictated by its complexity.

Proper scoring rules assess the quality\nof predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at\nthe precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the\nproperty. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the\ncharacterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little\nliterature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at\nhand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of\nproperties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function\nof several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted\nsum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction\nto a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to\ndifferent constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the\nchoice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which\nchoice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an\ninteresting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target\nproperty changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best\nconfiguration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand\nhow it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and\nthen provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties\nand of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly\ninterprets the experimental results. In higher-dimensional situations, we\nespecially study the linear cases and suggest that more complex settings can be\nunderstood with locally mapping into linear situations or using linear\napproximations when the true values of sub-properties are close enough to the\nparametric space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u95f4\u63a5\u5f15\u53d1\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6743\u91cd\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u901a\u5e38\u4e3a\u96f6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\u4ee5\u95f4\u63a5\u5f15\u53d1\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6743\u91cd\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u901a\u5e38\u4e3a\u96f6\uff0c\u4e14\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u968f\u6743\u91cd\u589e\u52a0\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u95f4\u63a5\u5f15\u53d1\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u901a\u5e38\u4e3a\u96f6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recent advances, such as Mamba, further enhance SSMs with\ninput-dependent gating and hardware-aware implementations, positioning them as\nstrong alternatives to Transformers for long sequence modeling. However,\nefficiently scaling the expressive power of SSMs, particularly with Mixture of\nExperts (MoE), remains challenging, as naive integration attempts often falter\nor degrade performance. In this work, we introduce Routing Mamba (RoM), a novel\napproach that scales SSM parameters using sparse mixtures of linear projection\nexperts.

Experimental results further show RoM\neffectively scales hybrid language models, yielding a 23% FLOPS saving compared\nto dense Mamba scaling for similar performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "RoM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6df7\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u4e13\u5bb6\u6269\u5c55SSM\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Mamba\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1SSM\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e0eMoE\u7ed3\u5408\uff09\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "RoM\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u8def\u7531\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Mamba\u5c42\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u57281.3B\u6d3b\u8dc3\u53c2\u6570\u548c16K\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0cRoM\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6Mamba\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u8282\u7701\u4e8623%\u7684FLOPS\u3002", "conclusion": "RoM\u4e3aSSM\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

While deep learning has\ndemonstrated remarkable potential for learning complex system behavior,\nachieving models that are both highly accurate and physically interpretable\nremains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured\nKolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates\nstructured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).\nSKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function\napproximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual\nsensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable\nquantities such as positions and velocities.

However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively\nexpensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression\nframework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient\nvariants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our\nmethod systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and\ntransferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the\nperformance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this\nframework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to\ncreate Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE\n(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of\nthe original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned\non a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them\nhighly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and\nremain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves\nsimilar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated\nparameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having\nsignificantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning\ncombined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating\nhigh-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE\narchitectures.

These challenges stem from their dependence on\npoint-to-point relationships for optimization, which can lead to difficulty in\naccurately capturing data sets' inherent structure and diversity. Additionally,\nthe intricate interplay between multiple kernels in such algorithms can further\nexacerbate these issues, effectively impacting their ability to cluster data\npoints in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we leverage granular-ball\ncomputing to improve the multi-kernel clustering framework.

Our starting point is the well-studied\npairwise same-set queries which ask if a pair of elements belong to the same\nclass. It is known that non-adaptive algorithms require $\\Theta(n^2)$ queries,\nwhile adaptive algorithms require $\\Theta(nk)$ queries, and the best known\nalgorithm uses $k-1$ rounds.

Once again in crowd sourcing applications, queries\non large sets may be prohibitive. For non-adaptive algorithms, we show\n$\\Omega(n^2/s^2)$ strong queries are needed.

We present ConvRecStudio, a framework that uses large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to simulate realistic, multi-turn dialogs grounded in\ntimestamped user-item interactions and reviews. ConvRecStudio follows a\nthree-stage pipeline: (1) Temporal Profiling, which constructs user profiles\nand community-level item sentiment trajectories over fine-grained aspects; (2)\nSemantic Dialog Planning, which generates a structured plan using a DAG of\nflexible super-nodes; and (3) Multi-Turn Simulation, which instantiates the\nplan using paired LLM agents for the user and system, constrained by\nexecutional and behavioral fidelity checks.

When modeling heterogeneity and dynamics in\nreal-world complex networks, GRL methods designed for complex heterogeneous\ntemporal graphs (HTGs) have been proposed and have achieved successful\napplications in various fields. However, most existing GRL methods mainly focus\non preserving the low-order topology information while ignoring higher-order\ngroup interaction relationships, which are more consistent with real-world\nnetworks. In addition, most existing hypergraph methods can only model static\nhomogeneous graphs, limiting their ability to model high-order interactions in\nHTGs. Therefore, to simultaneously enable the GRL model to capture high-order\ninteraction relationships in HTGs, we first propose a formal definition of\nheterogeneous temporal hypergraphs and $P$-uniform heterogeneous hyperedge\nconstruction algorithm that does not rely on additional information. Then, a\nnovel Heterogeneous Temporal HyperGraph Neural network (HTHGN), is proposed to\nfully capture higher-order interactions in HTGs. HTHGN contains a hierarchical\nattention mechanism module that simultaneously performs temporal\nmessage-passing between heterogeneous nodes and hyperedges to capture rich\nsemantics in a wider receptive field brought by hyperedges. Furthermore, HTHGN\nperforms contrastive learning by maximizing the consistency between low-order\ncorrelated heterogeneous node pairs on HTG to avoid the low-order structural\nambiguity issue.

However, conventional approaches relying on experimental\nmeasurements or density functional theory (DFT) calculations are often\nresource-intensive, limiting their scalability. Machine learning (ML) models\noffer a promising alternative by learning complex structure-property\nrelationships from data, enabling faster predictions. Yet, existing ML models\noften rely on labeled data, adopt representations that poorly capture essential\nstructural characteristics, and lack integration with physical\nprinciples--factors that limit their generalizability and interpretability.\nHere, we introduce CLOUD (Crystal Language mOdel for Unified and Differentiable\nmaterials modeling), a transformer-based framework trained on a novel\nSymmetry-Consistent Ordered Parameter Encoding (SCOPE) that encodes crystal\nsymmetry, Wyckoff positions, and composition in a compact, coordinate-free\nstring representation. Pre-trained on over six million crystal structures,\nCLOUD is fine-tuned on multiple downstream tasks and achieves competitive\nperformance in predicting a wide range of material properties, demonstrating\nstrong scaling performance.

Therefore, our findings suggest that\nwhile Fast-Forwarding may improve student practice efficiency, the size of its\npractical impact may also depend on students' ability to stay motivated and\nengaged at higher levels of difficulty.", "AI": {"tldr": "Fast-Forwarding\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7ec3\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u5b66\u751f\u52a8\u673a\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b66\u751f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7ec3\u4e60\u5df2\u638c\u63e1\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFast-Forwarding\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "Fast-Forwarding\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7ec3\u4e60\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u9009\u62e9\u96be\u9898\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Fast-Forwarding\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7ec3\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The\ndiscrepancy in data distributions across different operating conditions\ndegrades model performance when a model trained under one condition is applied\nto others. With the recent advancements in deep learning, transfer learning has\nbeen introduced to the fault diagnosis field as a paradigm for addressing\nmulti-condition fault diagnosis. Among these methods, domain generalization\napproaches can handle complex scenarios by extracting condition-invariant fault\nfeatures. Although many studies have considered fault diagnosis in specific\nmulti-condition scenarios, the extent to which operating conditions affect\nfault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial. However, the\nextent to which operating conditions affect fault information has been scarcely\nstudied, which is crucial. When operating conditions have a significant impact\non fault features, directly applying domain generalization methods may lead the\nmodel to learn condition-specific information, thereby reducing its overall\ngeneralization ability. This paper investigates the performance of existing\nend-to-end domain generalization methods under varying conditions, specifically\nin variable-speed and variable-load scenarios, using multiple experiments on a\nreal-world gearbox. Additionally, a two-stage diagnostic framework is proposed,\naiming to improve fault diagnosis performance under scenarios with significant\noperating condition impacts. By incorporating a domain-generalized encoder with\na retraining strategy, the framework is able to extract condition-invariant\nfault features while simultaneously alleviating potential overfitting to the\nsource domain.

While clients only share model updates with the aggregator,\nstudies reveal that aggregators can infer sensitive information from these\nupdates. Secure Aggregation (SA) protects individual updates during\ntransmission; however, recent work demonstrates a critical vulnerability where\nadversarial aggregators manipulate client selection to bypass SA protections,\nconstituting a Biased Selection Attack (BSA). Although verifiable random\nselection prevents BSA, it precludes informed client selection essential for FL\nperformance. We propose Adversarial Robust Federated Learning (AdRo-FL), which\nsimultaneously enables: informed client selection based on client utility, and\nrobust defense against BSA maintaining privacy-preserving aggregation. AdRo-FL\nimplements two client selection frameworks tailored for distinct settings. The\nfirst framework assumes clients are grouped into clusters based on mutual\ntrust, such as different branches of an organization. The second framework\nhandles distributed clients where no trust relationships exist between them.\nFor the cluster-oriented setting, we propose a novel defense against BSA by (1)\nenforcing a minimum client selection quota from each cluster, supervised by a\ncluster-head in every round, and (2) introducing a client utility function to\nprioritize efficient clients. For the distributed setting, we design a\ntwo-phase selection protocol: first, the aggregator selects the top clients\nbased on our utility-driven ranking; then, a verifiable random function (VRF)\nensures a BSA-resistant final selection. AdRo-FL also applies quantization to\nreduce communication overhead and sets strict transmission deadlines to improve\nenergy efficiency.

Naturally, it is common to demonstrate\nthe advantages of these new controllers against established methods like\nanalytical controllers. We observe, however, that reliably comparing the\nperformance of such very different classes of controllers is more complicated\nthan might appear at first sight. As a case study, we take up the problem of\nagile tracking of an end-effector for a quadrotor with a fixed arm. We develop\na set of best practices for synthesizing the best-in-class RL and geometric\ncontrollers (GC) for benchmarking. In the process, we resolve widespread\nRL-favoring biases in prior studies that provide asymmetric access to: (1) the\ntask definition, in the form of an objective function, (2) representative\ndatasets, for parameter optimization, and (3) feedforward information,\ndescribing the desired future trajectory. The resulting findings are the\nfollowing: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned\nand classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can\nyield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC,\nbut we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than\npreviously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric\ncontrol achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better\ntransient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or\nless agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required.\nFinally, we open-source implementations of geometric and RL controllers for\nthese aerial vehicles, implementing best practices for future development.\nWebsite and code is available at https://pratikkunapuli.github.io/rl-vs-gc/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60RL\uff09\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08GC\uff09\u5728\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u504f\u5411RL\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63ed\u793aRL\u548cGC\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u4e24\u7c7b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u672b\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u5668\u7684\u654f\u6377\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff09\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83RL\u4e0eGC\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u524d\u9988\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0bRL\u548cGC\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u5c0f\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\uff1bGC\u5728\u7a33\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u800cRL\u5728\u77ac\u6001\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u654f\u6377\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8f93\u51fa\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\uff08BF\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u8c03\u4f18\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86BF\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\uff08BF\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6982\u7387\u96c6\u4e2d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0BF\u968f\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8c03\u4f18\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eBF\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5982\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff09\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u9f50\u8c03\u4f18\u5e76\u672a\u6839\u672c\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5f15\u5bfc\u5176\u9009\u62e9\u4f4e\u71b5\u8def\u5f84\uff0cBF\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a7\u5236LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The regions of\ninterest (ROIs) were manually segmented from pre-surgical CT scans, and 1132\nradiomic features were extracted from the pre-surgical CT scans using\nPyradiomics. Six explainable machine learning modeling algorithms were\nimplemented respectively, for determining the optimal radiomics pipeline. The\ndiagnostic performance of the radiomic model was evaluated by using\nsensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1 score, confusion matrices,\nand ROC curves. To enhance clinical understanding and usability, we separately\nimplemented SHAP analysis and feature mapping visualization, and evaluated the\ncalibration curve and decision curve.

We first train a high-capacity vision\ntransformer (ViT) teacher model, pre-trained using I-JEPA self-supervised\nlearning, to classify fundus images into four classes: Normal, Diabetic\nRetinopathy, Glaucoma, and Cataract. We kept an Internet of Things (IoT) focus\nwhen compressing to a CNN-based student model for deployment in\nresource-limited conditions, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This was\naccomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned\nCross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a\nmulti-view robust training method.

The key to effective multi-scenario\nrecommendation lies in capturing both user preferences shared across all\nscenarios and scenario-aware preferences specific to each scenario. However,\nexisting methods often overlook user-specific modeling, limiting the generation\nof personalized user representations. To address this, we propose PERSCEN, an\ninnovative approach that incorporates user-specific modeling into\nmulti-scenario matching. PERSCEN constructs a user-specific feature graph based\non user characteristics and employs a lightweight graph neural network to\ncapture higher-order interaction patterns, enabling personalized extraction of\npreferences shared across scenarios. Additionally, we leverage vector\nquantization techniques to distil scenario-aware preferences from users'\nbehavior sequence within individual scenarios, facilitating user-specific and\nscenario-aware preference modeling.

Despite this\ncommon practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or\nwhether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental\npractical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it\ncould serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa,\nthe unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious\nsafety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model\nediting and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known\nto exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I\nmodel families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and\nthree fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive\nempirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our\nfindings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,\neven when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we\nobserve that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same\ntime, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining\nsignificantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These\nfindings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies,\nemphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term\ncontrol and alignment of deployed AI systems.

The completed matrix is often required to satisfy\nadditional structural constraints, such as positive semi-definiteness or a\nbounded infinity norm. The problem arises in various research fields, including\nmachine learning, statistics, and theoretical computer science, and has broad\nreal-world applications.\n  This paper presents new $\\mathsf{NP} $-hardness results for low-rank matrix\ncompletion problems. We show that for every sufficiently large integer $d$ and\nany real number $\\varepsilon \\in [ 2^{-O(d)},\\frac{1}{7}]$, given a partial\nmatrix $A$ with exposed values of magnitude at most $1$ that admits a positive\nsemi-definite completion of rank $d$, it is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard to find a\npositive semi-definite matrix that agrees with each given value of $A$ up to an\nadditive error of at most $\\varepsilon$, even when the rank is allowed to\nexceed $d$ by a multiplicative factor of $O (\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon ^2 \\cdot\n\\log(1/\\varepsilon)} )$. This strengthens a result of Hardt, Meka, Raghavendra,\nand Weitz (COLT, 2014), which applies to multiplicative factors smaller than\n$2$ and to $\\varepsilon $ that decays polynomially in $d$. We establish similar\n$\\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for the case where the completed matrix is\nconstrained to have a bounded infinity norm (rather than be positive\nsemi-definite), for which all previous hardness results rely on complexity\nassumptions related to the Unique Games Conjecture.

However, accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels can be\nchallenging due to imbalanced data distribution and varying vessel thickness.\nIn this paper, we propose BLCB-CNN, a novel pipeline based on deep learning and\nbi-level class balancing scheme to achieve vessel segmentation in retinal\nfundus images. The BLCB-CNN scheme uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\narchitecture and an empirical approach to balance the distribution of pixels\nacross vessel and non-vessel classes and within thin and thick vessels. Level-I\nis used for vessel/non-vessel balancing and Level-II is used for thick/thin\nvessel balancing. Additionally, pre-processing of the input retinal fundus\nimage is performed by Global Contrast Normalization (GCN), Contrast Limited\nAdaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and gamma corrections to increase\nintensity uniformity as well as to enhance the contrast between vessels and\nbackground pixels.

While\nwritten GEC is well-established, spoken GEC (SGEC), aiming to provide feedback\nbased on learners' speech, poses additional challenges due to disfluencies,\ntranscription errors, and the lack of structured input. SGEC systems typically\nfollow a cascaded pipeline consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),\ndisfluency detection, and GEC, making them vulnerable to error propagation\nacross modules. This work examines an End-to-End (E2E) framework for SGEC and\nfeedback generation, highlighting challenges and possible solutions when\ndeveloping these systems. Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are\ncompared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E\nsystems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an\nautomatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data\nfrom 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system,\nadditional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated.\nCandidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving\nperformance.

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions.

Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to\nquantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static\nneuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a\nC++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across\nprompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a\ngradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:\nper-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering\ndirections, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to\nselect the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably\nbiases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe\nclassification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe\nclassification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For\nLLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted\ninjections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer\nprobing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by\nsteering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior. These\nresults demonstrate a scalable, interpretable and efficient mechanism for\nconcept-level control for practical agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u79d1\u5b66\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u504f\u5411\u7279\u5b9a\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u63d0\u51faG-ACT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u521d\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5f00\u53d1\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff08G-ACT\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a2\u9488\u9009\u62e9\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaMA-3.2 3B\u4e2d\uff0cG-ACT\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534715%\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u63d0\u534761.5%\uff1b\u5728LLaMA-3.3 70B\u4e2d\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u5c42\u5e72\u9884\u4ecd\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "G-ACT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}
