Unlike state-of-the-art approaches that delay\nkey-value separation until the flush stage, leading to redundant data in\nMemTables and repeated writes. BVLSM proactively decouples keys and values\nduring the WAL phase. The MemTable stores only lightweight metadata, allowing\nmulti-queue parallel store for big value.

NVM, along with Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Solid\nState Disk (SSD), and Disk present a system designer with a wide array of\noptions in designing caching middleware. Moreover, design decisions to\nreplicate a data item in more than one level of a caching memory hierarchy may\nenhance the overall system performance with a faster recovery time in the event\nof a memory failure. Given a fixed budget, the key configuration questions are:\nWhich storage media should constitute the memory hierarchy? What is the storage\ncapacity of each hierarchy? Should data be replicated or partitioned across the\ndifferent levels of the hierarchy? We model these cache configuration questions\nas an instance of the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP). This model is\nguided by the specification of each type of memory along with an application's\ndatabase characteristics and its workload. Although MCKP is NP-complete, its\nlinear programming relaxation is efficiently solvable and can be used to\nclosely approximate the optimal solution. We use the resulting simple algorithm\nto evaluate design tradeoffs in the context of a memory hierarchy for a\nKey-Value Store (e.g., memcached) as well as a host-side cache (e.g.,\nFlashcache).

We showcase the\neffectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk\ncategories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent\nblanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while\nmaintaining topic relevance.", "AI": {"tldr": "SafeSteer\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u5b89\u5168\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u5b89\u5168\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u9762\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0f\u62d2\u7edd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cdLLM\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5168\u9762\u62d2\u7edd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeSteer\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u8c03\u6574\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u7b80\u5355\u6280\u672f\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In its most\nbasic form, it asks for the set of substrings of a given string $S$ of length\n$n$ that occur at least $\\tau$ times in $S$, for some integer $\\tau\\in[1,n]$.\nWe introduce a resilient version of this classic problem, which we term the\n$(\\tau, k)$-Resilient Pattern Mining (RPM) problem. Given a string $S$ of\nlength $n$ and two integers $\\tau, k\\in[1,n]$, RPM asks for the set of\nsubstrings of $S$ that occur at least $\\tau$ times in $S$, even when the\nletters at any $k$ positions of $S$ are substituted by other letters.

However, creating the training dataset for their skill\nacquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires\nsignificant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks\nto learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are\nactually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful\nlearning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To\naddress this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for\nLLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target\nbehaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an\nexploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train\nthe target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.\nSpecifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively\ngenerate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to\ntrain Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice\nevaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback\nthen guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data\ngeneration process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's\nability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the\ncapabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving\nsubstantial performance improvements.

Minimizers of smaller density are preferred as they\nproduce smaller samples with the same guarantee: each window is represented by\na $k$-mer.\n  The problem of finding a minimizer of minimum density for given input\nparameters $(\\sigma,k,w)$ has a huge search space of $(\\sigma^k)!$ and is\nrepresentable by an ILP of size $\\tilde\\Theta(\\sigma^{k+w})$, which has\nworst-case solution time that is doubly-exponential in $(k+w)$ under standard\ncomplexity assumptions. We solve this problem in $w\\cdot 2^{\\sigma^k+O(k)}$\ntime and provide several additional tricks reducing the practical runtime and\nsearch space. As a by-product, we describe an algorithm computing the average\ndensity of a minimizer within the same time bound. Then we propose a novel\nmethod of studying minimizers via regular languages and show how to find, via\nthe eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis over finite automata, minimizers with the\nminimal density in the asymptotic case $w\\to\\infty$. Implementing our\nalgorithms, we compute the minimum density minimizers for\n$(\\sigma,k)\\in\\{(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(4,2)\\}$ and \\textbf{all} $w\\ge 2$. The\nobtained densities are compared against the average density and the theoretical\nlower bounds, including the new bound presented in this paper.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5668\uff08minimizers\uff09\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u627e\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5668\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e2d\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3a$w\\cdot 2^{\\sigma^k+O(k)}$\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6b63\u5219\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6709\u9650\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5668\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific\npriors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,\nexisting LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal\npriors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during\nequation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual\nReasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight\nwith reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.\nSpecifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,\nmonotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate\nstructured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and\nestablishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations.

For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency\nis required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major\nbottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites\nto ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at\nleast some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.\nIn this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect\nchanges caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite\nimages and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for\ndownlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural\nnetworks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as \"memristors\"\n(nonlinear resistors with memory).

While related estimators\nsuch as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &\nWitter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for\nKernelSHAP have remained elusive.

We then prove strong\nnon-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our\nframework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical\nguarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing\nestimators.

In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a\ncrowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired\nmulti-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans\ndiverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around\n12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are\ninfluenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not\ndirectly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and\nactual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,\nrevealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static\nencyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess\nperformance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by\ntesting search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and\nconventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does\nnot degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,\nthe quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on\nthe model's parametric knowledge.

Of course, the process of\ncreating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training\nruns which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and\noutput encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),\nindeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of\nlosses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing\nloss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard\ngradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular\nparameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the\ndifferentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for\noptimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel\nlayer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the\ninherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding\ndegenerate empirical gradients.

We prove that the gap between the\nCL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under\na bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.\n  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL\nloss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class\ncollapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We\nfurther introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This\nbound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion\nand variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional\nvariation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect\ndiminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable\nCL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery\nusing simple linear probes.\n  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL\nand NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\#\\text{classes}})$;\nthe two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings\nthe NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the\nproposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance\nin practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CL\uff09\u76ee\u6807\u9690\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u4ec5\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u201d\uff08NSCL\uff09\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u968f\u7740\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0cCL\u4e0eNSCL\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u586b\u8865\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNSCL\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "CL\u4e0eNSCL\u635f\u5931\u5dee\u8ddd\u968f\u7c7b\u522b\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u793a\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002"}}

This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known\npre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed\ngrokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR\nthrough the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality\nmetric $\\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing\nmetrics detect only the first two. The \\emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by\ntraining for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\\alpha < 2$ and the\nappearance of \\emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the\nrandomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and\nsignal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual\ninspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using\nKolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including\nactivation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$\nweight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking\nfrom anti-grokking.

Drawing inspiration from human\nmetacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:\nmetacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning\nstrategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and\nmetacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future\nlearning).

In\nthis paper, we propose \\textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \\textit{LLM\nSelf-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search\nstrategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via\nself-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or\nhardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path\nor explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This\nenables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual\ntuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku\nagainst three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth\nFirst Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which\nhave been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning\ntasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without\nadditional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other\nmethods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with\nstronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with\nincreased compute budget.

We first curate,\nstandardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,\nanti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain\nmutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein\nmodels including masked language models, autoregressive language models,\ninverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph\nmodels. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity\nvalues is used to evaluate model performance.

Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with\nrestart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating\nexpected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.\nExperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural\nMJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical\nlearning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Neural MJD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33Merton\u8df3\u8dc3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08SDE\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7a81\u53d8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9ed1\u76d2\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u65e0\u6cd5\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7a81\u53d8\u60c5\u51b5\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "Neural MJD\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u975e\u9f50\u6b21It\u00f4\u6269\u6563\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u975e\u9f50\u6b21\u590d\u5408\u6cca\u677e\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u622a\u65ad\u4f3c\u7136\u673a\u5236\u548cEuler-Maruyama\u91cd\u542f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNeural MJD\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Neural MJD\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Sharing the global advantage among agents often\nleads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct\ncontributions of agents.

This work analyzes the\nover-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level\nperspective.

CORA evaluates\ncoalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions\nand decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,\nensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA\nemploys random coalition sampling.

We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for\nmodel and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be\npreferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on\ndense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are\nderived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,\nthat use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative\nloss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use\nderived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's\nstronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard\nCLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for\nvarious downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for\ndifferent open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the\nsame trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving\nscaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.\nAccurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and\ndataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on\nmeasurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic\ncomparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their\ncreation.

By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and\nsegmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning\nsegmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling\nthe models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual\nrepresentations.

We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed\nacyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths\ncorrespond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in\nthe real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize\nthe task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements\nlike safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully\nanalyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In\nthis work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible\nagent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also\nknown as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition\nwhere the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We\nintroduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a\nnear-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a\nunion bound and dynamic programming.

Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based\nqueries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite\nreflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,\nlocation analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric\nreasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,\nincluding MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The\nbest-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge\nthe gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a\ncomprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200\nrandomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved\nsuperior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best\nradiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI\nperformance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The\nreader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human\nexperts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing\nmore variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models.

Personalizing certain\nparts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts\nto differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.\nHowever, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client\ndrift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby\nreducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL\nframework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),\nreferred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented\nLagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal\nterms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction\nand the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and\nshared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit\nestimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of\nconvergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global\nconvergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary\npoint, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under\nmild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and\nmultimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of\nFedAPM.

Traditional drought indices, such\nas the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index\n(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,\nlimiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to\ndrought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,\nlacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple\ndistricts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine\nlearning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh.

In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel\nlikelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that\ninterchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL\nframework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model\ndensities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)\ncontinuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)\nconvex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences\nsuch as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical\nframework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q\n= p/\\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact\nbounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form\nexpression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our\nanalysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,\ndefining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and\ncontinuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate\ninto practical ones.

By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of\nmodeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond\nlocal neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still\nunderexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.\nFurthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing\nmechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional\nencoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains\nunclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what\nconditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive\nbenchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development\nof GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive\nbenchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and\nmultidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings\nand incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our\nbenchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks\nand datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our\nbenchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of\ntransferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the\nefficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific\npositional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional\nencodings.

Project Page:\n  https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/hmar/", "summary": "Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed\nand quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR\nreformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive\nresolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On\nImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform\nparameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop\nefficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve\nfaster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x\nrespectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint.

In this work, we\ninvestigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While\nprevious explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper\ncharacteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's\nadaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we\nidentify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller\nthan the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a\n$\\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient\ninformation.

Existing\nmethodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the\ndevice's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details\nnecessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two\nsignificant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB\ncamera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of\nemploying visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise\ntimestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high\nfrequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the\nphysical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a\nphysical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively\naddresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of\nRGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed\nformulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats\nrepresentation.

While quantizing weights and activations is effective at\nimproving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade\nperformance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,\nwhich introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving\ntransforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable\npre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,\n(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,\ndynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies\ninherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain\nthe model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to\nbe more quantization friendly.

However, directly\napplying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated\npaths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.\nTo overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by\nincorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.\nExtensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks\ndemonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines.

The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as\nWiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that\nenables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different\nbands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network\nthroughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel\nallocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has\npredominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization\nwithin static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses\nthe dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO\ncapabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization\nproblem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the\ninherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a\nMulti-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel\nallocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing\nupper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further\nreduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network\nscenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic\nchannel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into\nthe BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS\nalgorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\\%$ faster than the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\\%$ of the optimal value.

We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a\npair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that\ntransformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic\nstructural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that\ndisentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we\nfound that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.\nTo overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in\nGalois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more\ngeneral representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature\nextraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,\nwhich prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple\nmethod to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by\ncombining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel\ntranslation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as\ngrouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed\nmethod on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.\nWe believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human\ndevelopment of object recognition in the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7fa4\u5206\u89e3\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5047\u8bbe\u89e3\u7f20\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u7279\u5f81\u8f74\u662f\u597d\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u6761\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7fa4\u5206\u89e3\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5c06\u50cf\u7d20\u5e73\u79fb\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5e73\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u540c\u4e00\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u671b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bc6\u522b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

A common\nsolution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,\ncurrent synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as\nmultiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category\nlabels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce\nGen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer\nDiffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks\nand diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt\nagent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground\ninstance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the\ngeneration of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and\nclean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out\nlow-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are\nrefined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine\nmultiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data\napproaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from\n50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance\nsegmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant\nimprovements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object\ndetection benchmarks with YOLO11m.

Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator\narchitecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization\nroutine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single\nphysics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase.

In particular, we characterize improper learning under a\nmild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to\nlearn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under\nwell-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable\nand agnostic online learning.

We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework\nthat assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark\naccuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,\nto better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We\nconstruct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic\nvariants) and train LLMs under each.

Then, applying this training scheme to multistable\ndynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin\nof attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system\nbehavior in entirely unobserved basins.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08RC\uff09\u5728\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u65f6\u5bf9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRC\u5728\u5355\u5438\u5f15\u76c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5438\u5f15\u76c6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57df\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u591a\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake\nwhich takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't\nknow how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the\nfish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather\nthan teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving\nthe expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In\nresponse, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.\nlearning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert\noutcomes, even after making a mistake.

Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to\n32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource\nallocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics\nScaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on\nmodels above a threshold than smaller ones.

Inspired by how new\nsoftware is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be\nstudied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple\napproach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize\nnew architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of\nactivation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the\nDiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this\ntestbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax\nattention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and\nreplacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.\nNotably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for\nDiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model\n(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval\nscore. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by\nconverting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via\ngrafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)\nthan other models of comparable depth.

This has compelled regulators to impose stringent\ncontrols on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading\nthese controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into\nsmaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve\nmultiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has\nbecome an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have\nfocused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has\nhindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a\nnovel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single\ninterpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction\nnetwork of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,\nGARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection\npower and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML\nworkflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score\ncalculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores\nof the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic\nand open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency\nmatrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work\nhighlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing\nfraud detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "GARG-AML\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u62c6\u5206\u4ea4\u6613\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d17\u94b1\u5360\u5168\u7403GDP\u76842%-5%\uff0c\u62c6\u5206\u4ea4\u6613\uff08smurfing\uff09\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u624b\u6bb5\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002", "method": "GARG-AML\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u9636\u4ea4\u6613\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6811\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u90bb\u5c45\u8282\u70b9\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGARG-AML\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GARG-AML\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u6027\u5728\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u6574\u5408\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u53cd\u6d17\u94b1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002"}}

To evaluate\nour agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both\nhuman participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent\nperforms on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its\nability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the\nagent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,\nalthough differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and\ncode to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous\ncommunication between LLM agents.

These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts\nin token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between\nalignment objectives.\n  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an\ninference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore\nalignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in\nexpected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically\ndemonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers\nor surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited\nresponse diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation\nsacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,\nensuring compatibility with AR.

It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object\ngeneration and layout generation. While recent generative models have\nsignificantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout\ngeneration remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either\noverfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize\nnumerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate\nscenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user\ninstructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates\nnumerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial\nreasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the\ngeneration into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting\nit into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial\nreasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we\nemploy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.\nAdditionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance\ngeneralization and spatial planning.

In practice, pre-training has been\nrelying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available\non the internet so far.

This enables us to obtain an\nimproved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be\nused to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the\nassociated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we\napply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional\ndouble-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a\nneural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide\ntheoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3akTULA\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u6570\u68af\u5ea6\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728KL\u6563\u5ea6\u548cWasserstein-2\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5168\u5c40Lipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u5e38\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u6570\u68af\u5ea6\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8etamed Langevin dynamics\u7684kTULA\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728KL\u6563\u5ea6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387$2-\\overline{\\epsilon}$\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86Wasserstein-2\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "kTULA\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53cc\u52bf\u9631\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and\nneurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer\ninterfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional\nmethods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight\nbut often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent\nTransformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong\ngeneralization performance, but typically have much larger computational\nrequirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time\nsettings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid\narchitecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention\nmodule with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and\ncausal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to\nnew sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We\nevaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical\ndecoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical\napplications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.\nNotably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings\nimproves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the\nexciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find\nthat POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art\nTransformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).\nThese results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the\ngap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural\ndecoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "POSSM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u5c16\u5cf0\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSM\uff09\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u7b80\u5355\u9012\u5f52\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caTransformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u3001\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u573a\u666f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPOSSM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u9012\u5f52SSM\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7334\u5b50\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cPOSSM\u89e3\u7801\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdbTransformer\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb9\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408SSM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u95ed\u73af\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}
