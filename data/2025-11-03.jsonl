Code queries cluster densely in\nembedding space while conversational queries distribute sparsely. Content\nstaleness varies from minutes (stock data) to months (code patterns). Query\nrepetition patterns range from power-law (code) to uniform (conversation),\nproducing long tail cache hit rate distributions: high-repetition categories\nachieve 40-60% hit rates while low-repetition or volatile categories achieve\n5-15% hit rates. Vector databases must exclude the long tail because remote\nsearch costs (30ms) require 15--20% hit rates to break even, leaving 20-30% of\nproduction traffic uncached. Uniform cache policies compound this problem:\nfixed thresholds cause false positives in dense spaces and miss valid\nparaphrases in sparse spaces; fixed TTLs waste memory or serve stale data. This\npaper presents category-aware semantic caching where similarity thresholds,\nTTLs, and quotas vary by query category. We present a hybrid architecture\nseparating in-memory HNSW search from external document storage, reducing miss\ncost from 30ms to 2ms. This reduction makes low-hit-rate categories\neconomically viable (break-even at 3-5% versus 15-20%), enabling cache coverage\nacross the entire workload distribution. Adaptive load-based policies extend\nthis framework to respond to downstream model load, dynamically adjusting\nthresholds and TTLs to reduce traffic to overloaded models by 9-17% in\ntheoretical projections."}

Several techniques are known, with\ncompressed static functions approaching the zero-order empirical entropy of the\nvalue sequence. In this paper, we introduce learned static functions, which use\nmachine learning to capture correlations between keys and values. For each key,\na model predicts a probability distribution over the values, from which we\nderive a key-specific prefix code to compactly encode the true value. The\nresulting codeword is stored in a classic static function data structure.

A three-step roadmap shows the transition from product- to\nnetwork- centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling\nacross variant and supply chain spaces, organizational anchoring (roles,\ntraining, compliance). The results are increased change robustness, shorter\nthroughput times, improved reuse, and informed sustainability decisions.

In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning?

Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream.

In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual\nreasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's\ninability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant\nlanguage (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to\nexamine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could\nhelp mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range\nof detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be\nidentified, with supervised approaches performing best.

To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the\nco-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal\nVideo Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to\nmeasure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks\nand domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable\nsynthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate\nthe semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality\nPyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by\nexplicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.\nExtensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\ngeneralization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular\nbenchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant\nretrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed\nframework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance\ntoward truly universal video retrieval."}

Foundation models provide powerful visual and\nmultimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional\nspaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by\nenabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing\napproaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs\nspecialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We\nintroduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle\nfor learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned\nviews. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate\nmaximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and\ndiverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP\nhashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced\ncodes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt\nencoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly\nwell-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes\nand supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These\nresults highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability."}

Compared to hash tables, these\nso-called static function data structures do not need to store the key set and\nthus use significantly less memory. Several techniques are known, with\ncompressed static functions approaching the zero-order empirical entropy of the\nvalue sequence. In this paper, we introduce learned static functions, which use\nmachine learning to capture correlations between keys and values. For each key,\na model predicts a probability distribution over the values, from which we\nderive a key-specific prefix code to compactly encode the true value. The\nresulting codeword is stored in a classic static function data structure. This\ndesign allows learned static functions to break the zero-order entropy barrier\nwhile still supporting point queries.

Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already\ncomputed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important\ntokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while\nmaintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL\ndivergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a\nGPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft\nattention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these\npredictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard\nspeculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in\nkey-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19\ndataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods.
