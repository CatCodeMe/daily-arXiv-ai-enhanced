We start with a test failure that was triaged by a rule-based test\nfailure bot. We then set up an agentic harness and allow the agent to reason\nand run a set of 15 actions from reading a file to generating a patch.

Jupyter notebooks are one of the main tools used by data\nscientists.

As a result, existing software engineering models, tools, and studies\ndo not capture the uniqueness of Notebook's behavior. Aims. This paper aims to\nprovide a large-scale empirical study of bugs and vulnerabilities in the\nNotebook ecosystem. Method. We collected and analyzed a large dataset of\nNotebooks from two major platforms. Our methodology involved quantitative\nanalyses of notebook characteristics (such as complexity metrics, contributor\nactivity, and documentation) to identify factors correlated with bugs.\nAdditionally, we conducted a qualitative study using grounded theory to\ncategorize notebook bugs, resulting in a comprehensive bug taxonomy. Finally,\nwe analyzed security-related commits and vulnerability reports to assess risks\nassociated with Notebook deployment frameworks. Results.

In this problem, the goal is to remove some edges\nof an undirected graph with edge weights and edge costs, so as to increase the\nweight of a minimum spanning tree. In the budget minimization version, the goal\nis to minimize the total cost of the removed edges, while achieving a desired\nincrease $\\Delta$ in the weight of the minimum spanning tree. An alternative\nobjective within the same framework is to maximize the profit of interdiction,\nnamely the increase in the weight of the minimum spanning tree, subject to a\nbudget constraint. There are known polynomial time $O(1)$ approximation\nguarantees for a similar objective (maximizing the total cost of the tree,\nrather than the increase). However, the guarantee does not seem to apply to the\nincrease in cost. Moreover, the same techniques do not seem to apply to the\nbudget version.\n  Our approximation guarantees are motivated by studying the question of\nminimizing the cost of increasing the minimum spanning tree by any amount. We\nshow that in contrast to the budget and profit problems, this version of\ninterdiction is polynomial time-solvable, and we give an efficient algorithm\nfor solving it. The solution motivates a graph-theoretic relaxation of the\nNP-hard interdiction problem. The gain in minimum spanning tree weight, as a\nfunction of the set of removed edges, is super-modular.

Most LLMs performed\nsimilarly and the differences in screening accuracy between secondary studies\nare greater than differences between LLMs. The cost of using an LLM is\nrelatively low - less than $40 per secondary study even for the most expensive\nmodel. Conclusions: Our benchmark enables monitoring AI performance in the\nscreening task of SRs in software engineering.

This research explores how RL,\nparticularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop\nautonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.\n  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning\nproblem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings within a simulated financial environment.

This\nmethod allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,\nenabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.\n  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches\nsignificantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across\nvarious performance metrics.

In this paper,\nwe report our experience using large language models (LLMs) in an IT consulting\ncompany to automate the requirements specification process. In this company,\nrequirements are specified using a Functional Design Specification (FDS), a\ndocument that outlines the functional requirements and features of a system,\napplication, or process. We provide LLMs with a summary of the requirements\nelicitation documents and FDS templates, prompting them to generate Epic FDS\n(including high-level product descriptions) and user stories, which are\nsubsequently compiled into a complete FDS document.

However, existing generative model-based OSFL\nmethods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in\nthe healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single\nround of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically\nDistributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a\nmodified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified\nFlow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation\nmethod are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling\nin medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing\nfeature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID\ndistributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic\nthe output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side\nteacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID\nmedical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform\nmulti-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,\nand exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%.

In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data\nhas an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the\nobservation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology\n``un-pruning\" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we\npropose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by\nretained data.

Moreover, if the problem\nadmits a unique solution then it must be in $\\mathsf{UEOPL}$.\n  We demonstrate that this represents just the tip of a much more general\nphenomenon, which holds for even harder search problems that lie higher up in\nthe total function polynomial hierarchy ($\\mathsf{TF\\Sigma_i^P}$).

A core aspect of MABs is the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to\nbe enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear\nbandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the\nsame linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration\nstrategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is\nincreasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration\nbehavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of\nseveral linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy\nlinear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier\nperformance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This\nobservation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which\nconsistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that\npure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings.\nOur results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for\nbandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory\nefficacy.

However, such updates can\nintroduce regressions, not only in correctness but also in code quality and\nperformance. To address this, we present ReCatcher, a regression testing\nframework for Python code generation. ReCatcher systematically compares two\nLLMs, typically a current model and a candidate update, across three\ndimensions: logical correctness, static code quality, and execution\nperformance. We apply ReCatcher to assess regressions across three update\nscenarios, fine-tuning, merging, and model release, using CodeLlama,\nDeepSeek-Coder, and GPT-4o. Our evaluation shows that fine-tuning with\ncross-language datasets increases syntax errors by up to 12%. Merging with\ngeneral-purpose models like Llama2 leads to regressions in correctness by up to\n18%. GPT-4o introduces regressions of up to 50% in handling missing imports\ncompared to GPT-3.5-turbo, while GPT-4o-mini suffers up to 80% performance\ndegradation in execution time versus GPT-4o.

While existing research on GNN\nrobustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced\nfaults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress\ntoward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency\ndemands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can\ncause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major\ntechnology companies (e.g., Meta and Google).

There are\nstrong parallels between this widespread framework and offline goal-conditioned\nreinforcement learning algorithms: a universal value function is trained on a\nlarge number of goals, and the policy is evaluated on a single goal in each\ntest episode. Extensive research in foundation models has shown that\nperformance can be substantially improved through test-time training,\nspecializing the model to the current goal. We find similarly that test-time\noffline reinforcement learning on experience related to the test goal can lead\nto substantially better policies at minimal compute costs. We propose a novel\nself-supervised data selection criterion, which selects transitions from an\noffline dataset according to their relevance to the current state and quality\nwith respect to the evaluation goal.

Previous ML\nmodels typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a\ntrained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed\nReynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of\nPDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of\nscales.

We leverage these facts to create a\nscale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a\ngiven domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.\nSince neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the\nnatural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of\nneural PDE solvers.

Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for\nclinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to\npredict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early\nclinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was\ncurated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical\nfeatures-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were\nselected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several\nmodels were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation;\nCatBoost demonstrated the best performance. Results: CatBoost achieved an AUROC\nof 0.88 on the independent test set, with sensitivity of 0.811 and specificity\nof 0.798. SHAP values and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots showed the\nmodel relied on meaningful predictors such as altered consciousness,\nvasopressor use, and coagulation status. Additionally, the DREAM algorithm was\nintegrated to estimate patient-specific posterior risk distributions, allowing\nclinicians to assess both predicted mortality and its uncertainty. Conclusions:\nWe present an interpretable machine learning pipeline for early, real-time risk\nassessment in ICU patients with HKD.

This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis\noptimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.\nNotably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%\nswitching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads\ncompared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the\nversatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite\nState Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of\nlogic functions.

Addressing this issue, we propose a\nnovel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that\nsystematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input\ntraining sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG)\ntechnique, which converts time series data into networks by representing\nmeasurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network\nis constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data\nsequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid\nexpensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is\ndirectly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study.\nWe assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical\nnonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency.\nCompared to an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and\ncomparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent\nperformance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u50a8\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff08DyRC\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u56fe\u6280\u672f\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u50a8\u5907\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u50a8\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u50a8\u5907\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u548c\u8fc7\u5927\u7f51\u7edc\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u56fe\uff08VG\uff09\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6784\u5efa\u50a8\u5907\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027Duffing\u632f\u8361\u5668\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDyRC-VG\u6bd4\u76f8\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi\u56fe\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DyRC-VG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u5316\u50a8\u5907\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

As mass spectrometers will be\ncentral to upcoming Solar System missions, predicting molecular assembly from\ntheir data without needing to elucidate unknown structures will be essential\nfor unbiased life detection.

First, it is interpretable for\nlife detection, as it reflects the assembly of molecules with their bonds as\nbuilding blocks, in contrast to approaches that discount construction history.\nSecond, it can be determined without structural elucidation, as it can be\nphysically measured by mass spectrometry, a property that distinguishes it from\nother approaches that use structure-based information measures for molecular\ncomplexity. Whilst molecular assembly is directly measurable using mass\nspectrometry data, there are limits imposed by mission constraints.

While\nempirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple\nobjective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work\nintroduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to\ndeconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the\nsingle-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category\nStoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,\nallows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes\nthree main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic\nrationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,\nquantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods\nexploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn\nnot just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a\nprocess we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we\nprove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive\nlearning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,\nwe show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align\nwith the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a\ngeometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs.

We explore two synthesis strategies: a\nnon-parametric method using Gaussian kernel density estimation, and a\nconditional normalizing flow model that learns invertible mappings for\nconditional density estimation. Experiments on four datasets show that SPADA\nreduces constraint violations by 4% compared to diffusion-based methods and\naccelerates generation by nearly 9,500 times over LLM-based baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPADA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u5efa\u6a21\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "SPADA\u5229\u7528LLM\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u56fe\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u7a00\u758f\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u65af\u6838\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSPADA\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c114%\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4LLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb\u8fd19,500\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SPADA\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

As a result, established platforms in other\ndomains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to\nengage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of\nthese experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI\ninnovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms\nactively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new\nchallenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video\nexperience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences\nintroduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when\noptimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos. These\nissues, together with the feedback loop inherent in recommender systems, make\nit difficult to build effective solutions. In this paper, we highlight the\nchallenges faced when introducing a new short-form video experience and present\nour experience showing that, even with sufficient video interaction data, it\ncan be more beneficial to leverage a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned\nmultimodal vision-language model to overcome these challenges.

For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling\ndatasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation.

While traditional\nmodels like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle\nto generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in\nvision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer\npromising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In\nthis work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze\nits performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and\nshape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to\nsuppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only\nclass-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent\nbehavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual\ncues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating\nclass-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce\nattention to class-defining features.

The motion of the rafts is\nrepresented by a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. Referred to as\nthe eBOMB model, this builds on the Maxey--Riley equation by incorporating\ninteractions between clumps of \\emph{Sargassum} forming a raft and the effects\nof Earth's rotation. The absence of a predictive law for the rafts' centers of\nmass suggests a need for machine learning. In this paper, we evaluate and\ncontrast Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and\nSparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). In both cases, a\nphysics-inspired closure modeling approach is taken rooted in eBOMB.\nSpecifically, the LSTM model learns a mapping from a collection of eBOMB\nvariables to the difference between raft center-of-mass and ocean velocities.\nThe SINDy model's library of candidate functions is suggested by eBOMB\nvariables and includes windowed velocity terms incorporating far-field effects\nof the carrying flow. Both LSTM and SINDy models perform most effectively in\nconditions with tightly bonded clumps, despite declining precision with rising\ncomplexity, such as with wind effects and when assessing loosely connected\nclumps.

To resolve these limitations,\nthe proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based\npost-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble\nmember, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution\nmodel outputs. Second, it reduces random errors through ensemble averaging of\nthe CNN-corrected members.

For\ncomparison with the proposed method, we additionally conducted experiments with\nthe CNN trained on ensemble-averaged forecasts. The first approach--CNN\ncorrection before ensemble averaging--consistently achieved higher accuracy\nthan the reverse approach. Although based on low-resolution ensemble forecasts,\nthe proposed method notably outperformed the high-resolution deterministic NWP\nmodels. These findings indicate that combining CNN-based correction with\nensemble averaging effectively reduces both the systematic and random errors in\nNWP model outputs.

In\ncontrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the\nusefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical\nevidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high\ncomputational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of\npassages evaluated.

To address this, we propose a method to\ndistill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient\nmodels. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking,\nenabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the\nneed for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer\ngeneration and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window\nmethod that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution\nfor RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer\nquality.

In this work, we focus\non applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate,\ncontext-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely\nhandcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines.\nWe give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a\nuser-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than\nlearning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the\ndegree to which it relies on this controller.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReCoDe\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u6539\u8fdb\u4e13\u5bb6\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u534f\u8c03\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "method": "ReCoDe\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u901a\u4fe1\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cReCoDe\u4f18\u4e8e\u624b\u5de5\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3001\u5176\u4ed6\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6807\u51c6MARL\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fdd\u7559\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bd4\u4ece\u5934\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0cReCoDe\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Content-based approaches, which leverage\nitem metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use\nembeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as\ninitialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content\nembeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt\nto the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can\ndegrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far\nfrom their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to\naddress this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or\nfine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen\nembeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting\nthem go too far from their original semantic structure. This approach\ndemonstrates consistent improvements across multiple datasets and modalities,\nincluding e-commerce datasets with textual descriptions and a music dataset\nwith audio-based representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c0f\u589e\u91cf\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5b8c\u5168\u51bb\u7ed3\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\u5185\u5bb9\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5185\u5bb9\u5d4c\u5165\u51bb\u7ed3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c0f\u589e\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u800c\u4e0d\u504f\u79bb\u539f\u59cb\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
