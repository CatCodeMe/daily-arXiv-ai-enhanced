### [1] [Compact Answers to Temporal Path Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22143)
*Muhammad Adnan,Diego Calvanese,Julien Corman,Anton Dignös,Werner Nutt,Ognjen Savković*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 研究基于路径的图查询，结合时间和边导航，探讨动态网络的查询方法，比较四种紧凑表示法的优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态网络中（如交通、疾病传播）时间相关查询的紧凑表示问题。

Method: 研究四种基于区间编码的紧凑表示法，分析其简洁性、唯一性和计算成本。

Result: 最精细的编码方法能有限表示密集时间下的查询答案。

Conclusion: 四种表示法各有优劣，最精细的编码适用于密集时间场景。

Abstract: We study path-based graph queries that, in addition to navigation through
edges, also perform navigation through time. This allows asking questions about
the dynamics of networks, like traffic movement, cause-effect relationships, or
the spread of a disease. In this setting, a graph consists of triples annotated
with validity intervals, and a query produces pairs of nodes where each pair is
associated with a binary relation over time. For instance, such a pair could be
two airports, and the temporal relation could map potential departure times to
possible arrival times. An open question is how to represent such a relation in
a compact form and maintain this property during query evaluation. We
investigate four compact representations of answers to a such queries, which
are based on alternative ways to encode sets of intervals. We discuss their
respective advantages and drawbacks, in terms of conciseness, uniqueness, and
computational cost. Notably, the most refined encoding guarantees that query
answers over dense time can be finitely represented.

### [2] [Is SHACL Suitable for Data Quality Assessment?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22305)
*Carolina Cortés Lasalle,Lisa Ehrlinger,Lorena Etcheverry,Felix Naumann*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何使用SHACL（Shapes Constraint Language）来评估知识图谱的数据质量，填补了现有方法未全面覆盖数据质量维度的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱因缺乏强制模式可能导致数据质量问题，影响依赖它们的应用。现有方法未能全面评估数据质量，因此需要探索SHACL的潜力。

Method: 作者定义了69个数据质量指标的SHACL形状，并实现了一个原型，自动实例化这些形状并从验证结果中计算数据质量度量。

Result: 研究提供了一个可重复使用的原型，展示了SHACL在评估知识图谱数据质量方面的可行性。

Conclusion: SHACL可以作为一种有效工具来全面评估知识图谱的数据质量，填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have been widely adopted in both enterprises, such as the
Google Knowledge Graph, and open platforms like Wikidata to represent domain
knowledge and support analysis with artificial intelligence. They model
real-world information as nodes and edges. To embrace flexibility, knowledge
graphs often lack enforced schemas (i.e., ontologies), leading to potential
data quality issues, such as semantically overlapping nodes. Therefore,
ensuring their quality is essential, as issues in the data can affect
applications relying on them. To assess the quality of knowledge graphs,
existing works either propose high-level frameworks comprising various data
quality dimensions without concrete implementations, define tools that measure
data quality with ad-hoc SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language)
queries, or promote the usage of constraint languages, such as the Shapes
Constraint Language (SHACL), to assess and improve the quality of the graph.
Although the latter approaches claim to address data quality assessment, none
of them comprehensively tries to cover all data quality dimensions. In this
paper, we explore this gap by investigating the extent to which SHACL can be
used to assess data quality in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we defined SHACL
shapes for 69 data quality metrics proposed by Zaveri et al. [1] and
implemented a prototype that automatically instantiates these shapes and
computes the corresponding data quality measures from their validation results.

### [3] [Scalability, Availability, Reproducibility and Extensibility in Islamic Database Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22384)
*Umar Siddiqui,Habiba Youssef,Adel Sabour,Mohamed Ali*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文介绍了QuranResearch.Org系统，旨在解决伊斯兰知识领域数据库的真实性、准确性、可扩展性、可用性和可重复性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着伊斯兰知识领域软件系统的普及，数据库的真实性、准确性、可扩展性和可用性成为主要问题。

Method: 提出QuranResearch.Org系统，专注于解决上述问题。

Result: 系统旨在提供可扩展、可用、可重复的伊斯兰数据库解决方案。

Conclusion: QuranResearch.Org系统为伊斯兰数据库系统提供了可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: With the widespread of software systems and applications that serve the
Islamic knowledge domain, several concerns arise. Authenticity and accuracy of
the databases that back up these systems are questionable. With the excitement
that some software developers and amateur researchers may have, false
statements and incorrect claims may be made around numerical signs or miracles
in the Quran. Reproducibility of these claims may not be addressed by the
people making such claims. Moreover, with the increase in the number of users,
scalability and availability of these systems become a concern. In addition to
all these concerns, extensibility is also another major issue. Properly
designed systems can be extensible, reusable and built on top of one another,
instead of each system being built from scratch every time a new framework is
developed. In this paper, we introduce the QuranResearch.Org system and its
vision for scalability, availability, reproducibility and extensibility to
serve Islamic database systems.

### [4] [Systematic Evaluation of Knowledge Graph Repair with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22419)
*Tung-Wei Lin,Gabe Fierro,Han Li,Tianzhen Hong,Pierluigi Nuzzo,Alberto Sangiovanni-Vinentelli*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了一种系统评估知识图谱修复质量的方法，基于SHACL约束，通过生成违规操作（VIOs）填补现有评估方法的不足，并利用大型语言模型构建修复系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖特定数据集，无法全面分析修复系统，需更通用的评估框架。

Method: 通过VIOs系统生成违规，构建基于大型语言模型的修复系统，并测试不同提示策略。

Result: 包含SHACL约束和知识图谱关键信息的简洁提示表现最佳。

Conclusion: 系统化评估方法有效填补了现有研究的空白，为知识图谱修复提供了更通用的分析工具。

Abstract: We present a systematic approach for evaluating the quality of knowledge
graph repairs with respect to constraint violations defined in shapes
constraint language (SHACL). Current evaluation methods rely on \emph{ad hoc}
datasets, which limits the rigorous analysis of repair systems in more general
settings. Our method addresses this gap by systematically generating violations
using a novel mechanism, termed violation-inducing operations (VIOs). We use
the proposed evaluation framework to assess a range of repair systems which we
build using large language models. We analyze the performance of these systems
across different prompting strategies. Results indicate that concise prompts
containing both the relevant violated SHACL constraints and key contextual
information from the knowledge graph yield the best performance.

### [5] [SAM: A Stability-Aware Cache Manager for Multi-Tenant Embedded Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22701)
*Haoran Zhang,Decheng Zuo,Yu Yan,Zhiyu Liang,Hongzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SAM是一种自主缓存管理器，通过AURA算法解决边缘节点上多数据库实例的缓存争用问题，结合H因子和V因子实现稳定高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限的边缘节点上多数据库实例共存导致缓存争用，传统方案在动态负载下效率低且不稳定。

Method: 提出AURA算法，结合H因子（历史稳定效率）和V因子（未来改进边际增益），通过自适应权重实现稳定决策。

Result: SAM在14种基准测试中表现优异，吞吐量高，对负载变化和缓存污染攻击具有强韧性，决策延迟可扩展。

Conclusion: 稳定性感知设计对大规模系统持续高性能至关重要，SAM证明了其在实际场景中的优越性。

Abstract: The co-location of multiple database instances on resource constrained edge
nodes creates significant cache contention, where traditional schemes are
inefficient and unstable under dynamic workloads. To address this, we present
SAM, an autonomic cache manager powered by our novel AURA algorithm. AURA makes
stability a first-class design principle by resolving the
exploitation-exploration dilemma: it achieves this by synthesizing two
orthogonal factors, which we introduce as: the H-factor, representing a
database's proven, historically stable efficiency (exploitation), and the
V-factor, representing its empirically estimated marginal gain for future
improvements (exploration). This dual-factor model, governed by an adaptive
weight, enables SAM to achieve sustained high performance through strategic
stability and robustness in volatile conditions.
  Extensive experiments against 14 diverse baselines demonstrate SAM's
superiority. It achieves top-tier throughput while being uniquely resilient to
complex workload shifts and cache pollution attacks. Furthermore, its decision
latency is highly scalable, remaining nearly constant as the system grows to
120 databases. Crucially, SAM achieves superior decision stability --
maintaining consistent optimization directions despite noise, avoiding
performance oscillations while ensuring predictable Quality of Service. These
results prove that a principled, stability-aware design is essential for
sustained high performance in real-world, large-scale systems.

### [6] [CleANN: Efficient Full Dynamism in Graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19802)
*Ziyu Zhang,Yuanhao Wei,Joshua Engels,Julian Shun*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: CleANN系统解决了动态图索引在更新和查询时的性能与质量问题，通过三种技术实现高效并发操作，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态图索引在数据更新时存在查询质量下降或更新成本高的问题，CleANN旨在解决这些问题。

Method: CleANN采用三种技术：工作负载感知链接、查询自适应邻域整合和半延迟内存清理。

Result: 在7个数据集上，CleANN在保持查询质量的同时，实现了7-1200倍的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: CleANN是首个在完全动态场景下保持高效和质量的并发ANNS索引。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) has become a quintessential
algorithmic problem for various other foundational data tasks for AI workloads.
Graph-based ANNS indexes have superb empirical trade-offs in indexing cost,
query efficiency, and query approximation quality. Most existing graph-based
indexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the
data after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,
deletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in
applications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently
supports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based
indexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query
quality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to
maintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve
these problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main
components: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to
combat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood
consolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory
cleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the
work spent by the first two components. We evaluate CleANN on 7 diverse
datasets on fully dynamic workloads and find that CleANN has query quality at
least as good as if the index had been built statically using the corresponding
data. In the in-memory setting using 56 hyper-threads, with all types of
queries running concurrently, at the same recall level, CleANN achieves 7-1200x
throughput improvement on million-scale real-world datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, CleANN is the first concurrent ANNS index to achieve such efficiency
while maintaining quality under full dynamism.

### [7] [Minimizing CGYRO HPC Communication Costs in Ensembles with XGYRO by Sharing the Collisional Constant Tensor Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22245)
*Igor Sfiligoi,Emily A. Belli,Jeff Candy*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: XGYRO通过将多个CGYRO模拟作为一个整体HPC任务执行，优化内存和通信开销，显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 融合等离子体模拟（如CGYRO）计算和内存需求高，多节点并行导致通信开销大，而多数研究需要模拟集合，因此开发XGYRO以优化整体性能。

Method: XGYRO将模拟集合视为单一任务，全局优化缓冲区分布，共享碰撞常数张量结构以减少内存占用和通信开销。

Result: 通过共享数据结构和全局优化，XGYRO显著降低单个模拟的内存需求，减少整体通信开销。

Conclusion: XGYRO为融合等离子体模拟集合提供高效解决方案，优化资源利用和性能。

Abstract: First-principles fusion plasma simulations are both compute and memory
intensive, and CGYRO is no exception. The use of many HPC nodes to fit the
problem in the available memory thus results in significant communication
overhead, which is hard to avoid for any single simulation. That said, most
fusion studies are composed of ensembles of simulations, so we developed a new
tool, named XGYRO, that executes a whole ensemble of CGYRO simulations as a
single HPC job. By treating the ensemble as a unit, XGYRO can alter the global
buffer distribution logic and apply optimizations that are not feasible on any
single simulation, but only on the ensemble as a whole. The main saving comes
from the sharing of the collisional constant tensor structure, since its values
are typically identical between parameter-sweep simulations. This data
structure dominates the memory consumption of CGYRO simulations, so
distributing it among the whole ensemble results in drastic memory savings for
each simulation, which in turn results in overall lower communication overhead.

TL;DR: 提出工作流模板作为解决计算资源能力展示问题的方案，并通过实验管理工具验证其适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在有限基准测试下展示计算资源能力的难题。

Method: 利用工作流模板和实验管理工具（如Cloudmesh和SmartSim）验证适应性。

Result: 工作流模板和工具在多种科学应用中表现良好，提升了适应性。

Conclusion: 工作流模板和实验管理工具是提升计算资源适应性的有效解决方案。

Abstract: A key hurdle is demonstrating compute resource capability with limited
benchmarks. We propose workflow templates as a solution, offering adaptable
designs for specific scientific applications. Our paper identifies common usage
patterns for these templates, drawn from decades of HPC experience, including
recent work with the MLCommons Science working group.
  We found that focusing on simple experiment management tools within the
broader computational workflow improves adaptability, especially in education.
This concept, which we term benchmark carpentry, is validated by two
independent tools: Cloudmesh's Experiment Executor and Hewlett Packard
Enterprise's SmartSim. Both frameworks, with significant functional overlap,
have been tested across various scientific applications, including conduction
cloudmask, earthquake prediction, simulation-AI/ML interactions, and the
development of computational fluid dynamics surrogates.

### [9] [A Semi-Supervised Federated Learning Framework with Hierarchical Clustering Aggregation for Heterogeneous Satellite Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22339)

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对低地球轨道卫星网络的半监督联邦学习框架，通过分层聚类聚合、稀疏化和自适应权重量化技术，显著减少了处理时间和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低地球轨道卫星在6G网络中扮演重要角色，但资源受限和动态环境使得联邦学习的可靠收敛和效率成为挑战。

Method: 采用半监督联邦学习框架，结合分层聚类聚合、稀疏化和自适应权重量化技术，分两阶段进行聚类聚合。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持模型精度的同时，处理时间减少3倍，能耗降低4倍。

Conclusion: 该框架为卫星网络中的分布式智能提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are emerging as key components of 6G
networks, with many already deployed to support large-scale Earth observation
and sensing related tasks. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising
paradigm for enabling distributed intelligence in these resource-constrained
and dynamic environments. However, achieving reliable convergence, while
minimizing both processing time and energy consumption, remains a substantial
challenge, particularly in heterogeneous and partially unlabeled satellite
networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel semi-supervised
federated learning framework tailored for LEO satellite networks with
hierarchical clustering aggregation. To further reduce communication overhead,
we integrate sparsification and adaptive weight quantization techniques. In
addition, we divide the FL clustering into two stages: satellite cluster
aggregation stage and Ground Stations (GSs) aggregation stage. The supervised
learning at GSs guides selected Parameter Server (PS) satellites, which in turn
support fully unlabeled satellites during the federated training process.
Extensive experiments conducted on a satellite network testbed demonstrate that
our proposal can significantly reduce processing time (up to 3x) and energy
consumption (up to 4x) compared to other comparative methods while maintaining
model accuracy.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文通过为Caliper HPC分析工具引入“通信区域”功能，实现了对通信数据及MPI进程的详细指标捕获，并通过三个应用案例展示了其效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Caliper工具无法捕获通信数据和MPI进程的详细指标，限制了性能分析的深度。

Method: 在Caliper中引入“通信区域”功能，结合Thicket工具，生成新的MPI通信模式可视化。

Result: 揭示了通信瓶颈和详细行为，展示了CPU和GPU系统的不同扩展行为。

Conclusion: 通信区域的引入显著提升了Caliper的实用性，为性能分析提供了更深入的洞察。

Abstract: We introduce ``communication regions'' into the widely used Caliper HPC
profiling tool. A communication region is an annotation enabling capture of
metrics about the data being communicated (including statistics of these
metrics), and metrics about the MPI processes involved in the communications,
something not previously possible in Caliper. We explore the utility of
communication regions with three representative modeling and simulation
applications, AMG2023, Kripke, and Laghos, all part of the comprehensive
Benchpark suite that includes Caliper annotations. Enhanced Caliper reveals
detailed communication behaviors. Using Caliper and Thicket in tandem, we
create new visualizations of MPI communication patterns, including halo
exchanges. Our findings reveal communication bottlenecks and detailed
behaviors, indicating significant utility of the special-regions addition to
Caliper. The comparative scaling behavior of both CPU and GPU oriented systems
are shown; we are able to look at different regions within a given application,
and see how scalability and message-traffic metrics differ.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于利润驱动的边缘存储系统框架，结合协作缓存、纠删码和弹性存储分区，以优化动态工作负载下的数据访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘服务器存储容量有限，难以处理高容量和低延迟的数据访问请求，尤其是在动态工作负载下。

Method: 动态分区边缘服务器存储为私有和公共区域，私有区域进一步按请求率细分，采用纠删码技术，设计数据放置和替换策略。

Result: 在Netflix和Spotify的真实数据上测试，系统利润比现有方法提高5-8%。

Conclusion: 提出的动态空间分区和弹性缓存策略有效提升了边缘存储系统的性能和利润。

Abstract: Edge Storage Systems have emerged as a critical enabler of low latency data
access in modern cloud networks by bringing storage and computation closer to
end users. However, the limited storage capacity of edge servers poses
significant challenges in handling high volume and latency sensitive data
access requests, particularly under dynamic workloads. In this work, we propose
a profit driven framework that integrates three key mechanisms which are
collaborative caching, erasure coding, and elastic storage partitioning. Unlike
traditional replication, erasure coding enables space efficient redundancy,
allowing data to be reconstructed from any subset of K out of K plus M coded
blocks. We dynamically partition each edge server s storage into private and
public regions. The private region is further subdivided among access points
based on their incoming request rates, enabling adaptive control over data
locality and ownership. We design a data placement and replacement policy that
determines how and where to store or evict coded data blocks to maximize data
access within deadlines. While the private region serves requests from local
APs, the public region handles cooperative storage requests from neighboring
servers. Our proposed Dynamic Space Partitioning and Elastic caching strategy
is evaluated on both synthetic and real world traces from Netflix and Spotify.
Experimental results show that our method improves overall system profitability
by approximately 5 to 8% compared to state of the art approaches under varied
workload conditions.

### [12] [Settling Weighted Token Swapping up to Algorithmic Barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22450)
*Nicole Wein,Guanyu,Zhang*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 研究了加权令牌交换问题，提出了针对树和一般图的近似算法，并给出了紧致的障碍结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决加权令牌交换问题，填补现有研究中缺乏针对加权情况的近似算法的空白。

Method: 提出近似算法，针对一般图和树分别给出不同的近似比率。

Result: 一般图的近似比率为2+2W/w，树的近似比率为1+W/w。

Conclusion: 首次为加权令牌交换问题提供了近似算法，并证明了其紧致性。

Abstract: We study the weighted token swapping problem, in which we are given a graph
on $n$ vertices, $n$ weighted tokens, an initial assignment of one token to
each vertex, and a final assignment of one token to each vertex. The goal is to
find a minimum-cost sequence of swaps of adjacent tokens to reach the final
assignment from the initial assignment, where the cost is the sum over all
swaps of the sum of the weights of the two swapped tokens. Unweighted token
swapping has been extensively studied: it is NP-hard to approximate to a factor
better than $14/13$, and there is a polynomial-time 4-approximation, along with
a tight "barrier" result showing that the class of locally optimal algorithms
cannot achieve a ratio better than 4. For trees, the problem remains NP-hard to
solve exactly, and there is a polynomial-time 2-approximation, along with a
tight barrier result showing that the class of $\ell$-straying algorithms
cannot achieve a ratio better than 2. Weighted token swapping with $\{0,1\}$
weights is much harder to approximation: it is NP-hard to approximate even to a
factor of $(1-\varepsilon) \cdot \ln n$ for any constant $\varepsilon>0$.
Restricting to positive weights, no approximation algorithms are known, and the
only known lower bounds are those inherited directly from the unweighted
version. We provide the first approximation algorithms for weighted token
swapping on both trees and general graphs, along with tight barrier results.
Letting $w$ and $W$ be the minimum and maximum token weights, our approximation
ratio is $2+2W/w$ for general graphs and $1+W/w$ for trees.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种放松FIFO语义的并发队列设计，基于MultiQueue和环形缓冲区，显著提高了吞吐量和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 严格的FIFO语义在并发队列中导致高竞争和低吞吐量，放松语义可以提升性能。

Method: 提出两种设计：基于MultiQueue和基于环形缓冲区的放松FIFO队列。

Result: 两种设计在微基准测试和大图广度优先搜索中均优于现有严格和放松FIFO队列。

Conclusion: 放松FIFO语义的并发队列设计能显著提高吞吐量和可扩展性。

Abstract: FIFO queues are a fundamental data structure used in a wide range of
applications. Concurrent FIFO queues allow multiple execution threads to access
the queue simultaneously. Maintaining strict FIFO semantics in concurrent
queues leads to low throughput due to high contention at the head and tail of
the queue. By relaxing the FIFO semantics to allow some reordering of elements,
it becomes possible to achieve much higher scalability. This work presents two
orthogonal designs for relaxed concurrent FIFO queues, one derived from the
MultiQueue and the other based on ring buffers. We evaluate both designs
extensively on various micro-benchmarks and a breadth-first search application
on large graphs. Both designs outperform state-of-the-art relaxed and strict
FIFO queues, achieving higher throughput and better scalability.

TL;DR: RedCoder是一个多轮对话红队代理，通过模拟对抗交互和多轮对话诱导代码生成模型产生漏洞代码，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队方法依赖人工且忽视多轮交互的实际情况，限制了其扩展性和实用性。

Method: 通过多代理游戏过程生成原型对话和攻击策略库，微调LLM作为RedCoder核心，动态检索策略诱导漏洞。

Result: 实验表明，RedCoder在多轮对话中诱导漏洞的效果优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RedCoder为评估代码生成系统的安全性提供了可扩展且有效的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation (i.e., Code LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in AI-assisted software development and
testing. However, recent studies have shown that these models are prone to
generating vulnerable or even malicious code under adversarial settings.
Existing red-teaming approaches rely on extensive human effort, limiting their
scalability and practicality, and generally overlook the interactive nature of
real-world AI-assisted programming, which often unfolds over multiple turns. To
bridge these gaps, we present RedCoder, a red-teaming agent that engages victim
models in multi-turn conversation to elicit vulnerable code. The pipeline to
construct RedCoder begins with a multi-agent gaming process that simulates
adversarial interactions, yielding a set of prototype conversations and an
arsenal of reusable attack strategies. We then fine-tune an LLM on these
prototype conversations to serve as the backbone of RedCoder. Once deployed,
RedCoder autonomously engages Code LLMs in multi-turn conversations,
dynamically retrieving relevant strategies from the arsenal to steer the
dialogue toward vulnerability-inducing outputs. Experiments across multiple
Code LLMs show that our approach outperforms prior single-turn and multi-turn
red-team methods in inducing vulnerabilities in code generation, offering a
scalable and effective tool for evaluating the security boundaries of modern
code-generation systems.

Abstract: This paper details the machine learning (ML) journey of a group of people
focused on software testing. It tells the story of how this group progressed
through a ML workflow (similar to the CRISP-DM process). This workflow consists
of the following steps and can be used by anyone applying ML techniques to a
project: gather the data; clean the data; perform feature engineering on the
data; splitting the data into two sets, one for training and one for testing;
choosing a machine learning model; training the model; testing the model and
evaluating the model performance. By following this workflow, anyone can
effectively apply ML to any project that they are doing.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出RandLuzz，利用大语言模型（LLMs）减少模糊测试中的随机性，通过生成可达种子和构造针对特定错误的变异器，显著提高错误检测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模糊测试中的随机性虽然有助于发现错误，但降低了效率。即使定向模糊测试减少了随机性，种子和变异器的随机性仍影响效率。

Method: 利用LLMs生成可达种子和构造针对特定错误的变异器，结合定向模糊测试，提出RandLuzz。

Result: RandLuzz在种子生成和错误暴露速度上显著优于现有定向模糊测试工具，最高提速4.8倍，部分错误可在60秒内暴露。

Conclusion: RandLuzz通过LLMs有效减少模糊测试中的随机性，显著提升错误检测效率。

Abstract: Fuzzing is highly effective in detecting bugs due to the key contribution of
randomness. However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of
fuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed
fuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations,
the dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical
components, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely
tied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the
challenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to
remove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With
their strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to
generate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct
bug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which
integrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and
mutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call
chain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To
construct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis,
obtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which
further help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate
RandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo,
Beacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz. With RandLuzz-generated seeds, the fuzzers
achieve an average speedup ranging from 2.1$\times$ to 4.8$\times$ compared to
using widely-used initial seeds. Additionally, when evaluated on individual
bugs, RandLuzz achieves up to a 2.7$\times$ speedup compared to the
second-fastest exposure. On 8 bugs, RandLuzz can even expose them within 60
seconds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码理解和生成任务中高质量数据集生成的挑战，特别是反编译二进制文件与原始源代码的对齐问题。

Method: 设计并实现CodableLLM框架，支持多语言，集成现有反编译器和解析器，自动化数据集生成。

Result: CodableLLM在数据集生成方面表现出高效和鲁棒性，优于现有工具。

Conclusion: CodableLLM为代码相关的大型语言模型提供了高效的数据集生成解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of large, high-quality datasets for code understanding and
generation remains a significant challenge, particularly when aligning
decompiled binaries with their original source code. To address this, we
present CodableLLM, a Python framework designed to automate the creation and
curation of datasets by mapping decompiled functions to their corresponding
source functions. This process enhances the alignment between decompiled and
source code representations, facilitating the development of large language
models (LLMs) capable of understanding and generating code across multiple
abstraction levels. CodableLLM supports multiple programming languages and
integrates with existing decompilers and parsers to streamline dataset
generation. This paper presents the design and implementation of CodableLLM,
evaluates its performance in dataset creation, and compares it to existing
tools in the field. The results demonstrate that CodableLLM offers a robust and
efficient solution for generating datasets tailored for code-focused LLMS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级protobuf系统因其复杂的嵌套数据结构，传统测试数据生成方法难以满足需求。

Method: 结合自动模式内省、统计值分布分析和递归下降算法，动态生成测试数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将测试数据准备时间减少95%，测试覆盖率提升80%，并能处理15层嵌套结构。

Conclusion: 该框架高效解决了复杂protobuf结构的测试数据生成问题，显著提升了测试效率。

Abstract: Large-scale enterprise systems utilizing Protocol Buffers (protobuf) present
significant challenges for performance testing, particularly when targeting
intermediate business interfaces with complex nested data structures.
Traditional test data generation approaches are inadequate for handling the
intricate hierarchical and graph-like structures inherent in enterprise
protobuf schemas. This paper presents a novel test data generation framework
that leverages Python's metaclass system for dynamic type enhancement and
statistical analysis of production logs for realistic value domain extraction.
Our approach combines automatic schema introspection, statistical value
distribution analysis, and recursive descent algorithms for handling deeply
nested structures. Experimental evaluation on three real-world enterprise
systems demonstrates up to 95\% reduction in test data preparation time and
80\% improvement in test coverage compared to existing approaches. The
framework successfully handles protobuf structures with up to 15 levels of
nesting and generates comprehensive test suites containing over 100,000 test
cases within seconds.

Motivation: Git的协作算法虽广泛使用但未被充分理解，研究其diff和merge算法可为其他领域提供借鉴。

Method: 通过分析Git的主要功能，包括diff计算、merge执行及复杂操作，揭示其行为特点。

Result: 发现Git存在多种意外行为，如histogram diff算法的极端情况、ort合并策略的时间复杂度问题、merge和rebase的非交换性等。

Conclusion: Git的diff和merge算法存在未预期的行为，需进一步研究以优化其性能和可预测性。

Abstract: Despite being widely used, the algorithms that enable collaboration with Git
are not well understood. The diff and merge algorithms are particularly
interesting, as they could be applied in other contexts. In this thesis, I
document the main functionalities of Git: how diffs are computed, how they are
used to run merges, and how merges enable more complex operations. In the
process, I show multiple unexpected behaviors in Git, including the following:
The histogram diff algorithm has pathological cases where a single-line change
can cause the entire rest of the file to be marked as changed. The default
merge strategy (ort) can result in merges requiring exponential time in the
number of commits in the history. Merges and rebases are not commutative, and
even when merges do not result in a conflict, the result is not specified but
depends on the diff algorithm used. And finally, sometimes when two sides of a
merge add different lines at the same position, the result is not a conflict,
but a merge containing both changes after each other, in arbitrary order.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动获取高质量指令-代码对成本高且规模有限，现有方法缺乏严格的数据验证，导致合成数据质量不佳。

Method: 提出CodeEvo框架，通过Coder生成代码和测试用例，Reviewer提供新指令和反馈，结合编译器确定性和生成反馈机制。

Result: 实验表明，基于CodeEvo数据微调的模型在多种代码生成基准测试中显著优于基线。

Conclusion: CodeEvo为代码中心数据合成提供了有效方法，并通过多角度分析验证了其优势。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instruction-code pairs is essential for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) for code generation. Manually curated data is expensive
and inherently limited in scale, motivating the development of code-centric
synthesis methods. Yet, current approaches either focus on augmenting existing
code or rely on predefined heuristics, both lacking rigorous data validation,
which results in synthetic data that is ungrounded, repetitive, or overly
simplistic. Inspired by collaborative programming practices, we propose
CodeEvo, a framework that synthesizes code data through iterative interactions
between two LLM agents: a Coder, which generates candidate code and test cases
based on given instructions, and a Reviewer, which guides the synthesis process
by producing new instructions and feedback. We further introduce a hybrid
feedback mechanism that combines compiler determinism with the generative
flexibility of agents, enabling automatic quality control throughout synthesis.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on CodeEvo data
significantly outperform established baselines across code generation
benchmarks with various difficulties. In-depth analyses further provide
insights from multiple perspectives into effective code-centric data synthesis.

*Vaani Goenka,Aalok D. Thakkar*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: BOOP框架通过强制四个阶段（规范、算法、实现、证明）帮助学生从语法驱动转向系统性推理，减少试错调试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新手程序员常依赖语法和测试用例驱动开发，AI工具加剧了这一问题，提供语法正确但概念错误的解决方案。

Method: BOOP框架包括规范、语言无关算法开发、实现和正确性证明四个阶段，通过VS Code扩展强制执行。

Result: 初步评估显示学生算法推理能力提升，试错调试减少，教师观察到基础技能更强。

Conclusion: BOOP框架有效帮助学生理解代码正确性，但初期可能显得冗长。

Abstract: Novice programmers frequently adopt a syntax-specific and test-case-driven
approach, writing code first and adjusting until programs compile and test
cases pass, rather than developing correct solutions through systematic
reasoning. AI coding tools exacerbate this challenge by providing syntactically
correct but conceptually flawed solutions. In this paper, we introduce BOOP
(Blueprint, Operations, OCaml, Proof), a structured framework requiring four
mandatory phases: formal specification, language-agnostic algorithm
development, implementation, and correctness proof. This shifts focus from
``making code work'' to understanding why code is correct.
  BOOP was implemented at our institution using a VS Code extension and
preprocessor that enforces constraints and identifies counterproductive
patterns. Initial evaluation shows improved algorithmic reasoning and reduced
trial-and-error debugging. Students reported better edge case understanding and
problem decomposition, though some initially found the format verbose.
Instructors observed stronger foundational skills compared to traditional
approaches.

TL;DR: TypyBench是一个评估大型语言模型（LLM）在Python代码库中类型推断能力的基准，提出了TypeSim和TypeCheck两个新指标，发现LLM在复杂嵌套类型和类型一致性方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态语言（如Python）的类型推断是一个持续挑战，LLM在此领域的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入TypyBench基准，包含TypeSim（捕捉预测类型与真实类型的语义关系）和TypeCheck（评估代码库中的类型一致性）两个新指标，并在50个高质量Python仓库上评估多种LLM。

Result: LLM在TypeSim上表现尚可，但在复杂嵌套类型和类型一致性方面存在显著问题。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注仓库级别的类型一致性，而非仅提升类型相似性。TypyBench为此提供了基础。

Abstract: Type inference for dynamic languages like Python is a persistent challenge in
software engineering. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
code understanding, their type inference capabilities remain underexplored. We
introduce TypyBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' type inference
across entire Python repositories. TypyBench features two novel metrics:
TypeSim, which captures nuanced semantic relationships between predicted and
ground truth types, and TypeCheck, which assesses type consistency across
codebases. Our evaluation of various LLMs on a curated dataset of 50
high-quality Python repositories reveals that, although LLMs achieve decent
TypeSim scores, they struggle with complex nested types and exhibit significant
type consistency errors. These findings suggest that future research should
shift focus from improving type similarity to addressing repository-level
consistency. TypyBench provides a foundation for this new direction, offering
insights into model performance across different type complexities and usage
contexts. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出利用科学论文中的方法描述作为LLM的独立规范，实现按需代码生成，可能替代人工维护的软件包。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少软件包维护成本，如依赖管理、错误修复和版本控制。

Result: 当前LLM能可靠生成与常规库性能相当的代码。

Conclusion: 预示向按需代码生成的范式转变，减少维护开销。

Abstract: Maintaining software packages imposes significant costs due to dependency
management, bug fixes, and versioning. We show that rich method descriptions in
scientific publications can serve as standalone specifications for modern large
language models (LLMs), enabling on-demand code generation that could supplant
human-maintained libraries. We benchmark state-of-the-art models
(GPT-o4-mini-high, Gemini Pro 2.5, Claude Sonnet 4) by tasking them with
implementing a diverse set of core algorithms drawn from original publications.
Our results demonstrate that current LLMs can reliably reproduce package
functionality with performance indistinguishable from conventional libraries.
These findings foreshadow a paradigm shift toward flexible, on-demand code
generation and away from static, human-maintained packages, which will result
in reduced maintenance overhead by leveraging published articles as sufficient
context for the automated implementation of analytical workflows.

Result: 该方法能帮助开发者理解代理输出，并支持完全自动化的补丁验证和修复流程。

Conclusion: 符号公式和可执行测试为LLM代理提供了可解释性和自动化能力，有望推动代理在生产环境中的应用。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents autonomously use external tools on top of
one or more LLMs to accomplish specific tasks. Lately LLM agents for software
engineering tasks have become popular. These agents can benefit from the use of
program analysis tools working on program representations. This is demonstrated
by existing agentic AI solutions such as AutoCodeRover or SpecRover which
perform automated program repair. Specifically the goal of these works is to
use program analysis to improve the patch quality. These agents are currently
being used to automatically fix static analysis issues from the widely used
SonarQube static analyzer.
  Nevertheless, for the agents to be deployed in a production environment,
agents need to suggest software artifacts, such as patches, with evidence and
with high confidence. In this work, we provide a workflow where an agent
provides explanations of the bug in the form of symbolic formulae. The
explanations are in the form of input conditions, infection conditions and
output conditions, implemented as property based tests (PBT) and
program-internal symbolic expressions. These can help in human developer
cognition of the agent outputs as well as in achieving completely automated
agentic workflows for software. The human developer can benefit from the input
condition, represented as a PBT, to generate various concrete inputs showing a
given issue. Furthermore, since the PBTs are executable, our explanations are
executable as well. We can thus also use the explanations in a completely
automated issue resolution environment for accepting or rejecting the patches
that are suggested by patching agents such as AutoCodeRover. Finally, as
agentic AI approaches continue to develop, the program analysis driven
explanations can be provided to other LLM-based repair techniques such as
Agentless to improve their output.

Motivation: 现有的集成模糊测试技术在资源调度和性能评估方面存在局限性，导致资源浪费。

Method: Legion采用基于上置信界算法的资源调度算法和多维种子评估策略。

Result: 在真实开源项目中检测到20个漏洞，包括5个未知漏洞和3个CVE漏洞。

Conclusion: Legion在性能和资源利用上优于现有技术，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Fuzzing is widely used for detecting bugs and vulnerabilities, with various
techniques proposed to enhance its effectiveness. To combine the advantages of
multiple technologies, researchers proposed ensemble fuzzing, which integrates
multiple base fuzzers. Despite promising results, state-of-the-art ensemble
fuzzing techniques face limitations in resource scheduling and performance
evaluation, leading to unnecessary resource waste. In this paper, we propose
Legion, a novel ensemble fuzzing framework that dynamically schedules resources
during the ensemble fuzzing campaign. We designed a novel resource scheduling
algorithm based on the upper confidence bound algorithm to reduce the resource
consumption of ineffective base fuzzers. Additionally, we introduce a
multidimensional seed evaluation strategy, which considers multiple metrics to
achieve more comprehensive fine-grained performance evaluation. We implemented
Legion as a prototype tool and evaluated its effectiveness on Google's
fuzzer-test-suite as well as real-world open-source projects. Results show that
Legion outperforms existing state-of-the-art base fuzzers and ensemble fuzzing
techniques, detecting 20 vulnerabilities in real-world open-source
projects-five previously unknown and three classified as CVEs.

Conclusion: Madupite在大规模MDP求解中实现了显著的扩展性和灵活性，成为当前唯一支持精确求解的工具。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce and benchmark madupite, a newly proposed
high-performance solver designed for large-scale discounted infinite-horizon
Markov decision processes with finite state and action spaces. After a brief
overview of the class of mathematical optimization methods on which madupite
relies, we provide details on implementation choices, technical design and
deployment. We then demonstrate its scalability and efficiency by showcasing
its performance on the solution of Markov decision processes arising from
different application areas, including epidemiology and classical control.
Madupite sets a new standard as, to the best of our knowledge, it is the only
solver capable of efficiently computing exact solutions for large-scale Markov
decision processes, even when these exceed the memory capacity of modern
laptops and operate in near-undiscounted settings. This is possible as madupite
can work in a fully distributed manner and therefore leverage the memory
storage and computation capabilities of modern high-performance computing
clusters. This key feature enables the solver to efficiently handle problems of
medium to large size in an exact manner instead of necessarily resorting to
function approximations. Moreover, madupite is unique in allowing users to
customize the solution algorithm to better exploit the specific structure of
their problem, significantly accelerating convergence especially in
large-discount factor settings. Overall, madupite represents a significant
advancement, offering unmatched scalability and flexibility in solving
large-scale Markov decision processes.

Result: 在Defects4J测试中达到83.1%准确率和84.8% F1分数，且泛化能力优于现有技术。

Conclusion: RePaCA展示了微调LLM在提升静态APCA准确性、泛化能力和可解释性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) seeks to automatically correct software bugs
without requiring human intervention. However, existing tools tend to generate
patches that satisfy test cases without fixing the underlying bug, those are
known as overfitting patches. To address this issue, Automated Patch
Correctness Assessment (APCA) attempts to identify overfitting patches
generated by APR tools. It can be solved as a static approach, meaning that no
additional information is needed beyond the original and fixed code snippets.
Current static techniques often struggle with reliability, flexibility and
transparency. To address these issues, we introduce RePaCA, a novel static APCA
technique that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized in thinking
tasks. Our model is prompted with both buggy and fixed code snippets and guided
to generate a Chain of Thought that analyses code differences, reasons about
how the patch addresses the root cause, and ultimately provides a binary
classification: correct or overfitting. To enhance these reasoning capabilities
for the APCA task specifically, the LLM is finetuned using Reinforcement
Learning with the Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm. When evaluated
on a standard Defects4J-derived test, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with 83.1% accuracy and an 84.8% F1-score. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates superior generalization capabilities when trained on different
datasets, outperforming the leading technique. This reasoning capability also
provides enhanced explainability for the patch assessment. These findings
underscore the considerable promise of finetuned, reasoning LLMs to advance
static APCA by enhancing accuracy, generalization, and explainability.

Conclusion: 蜕变测试是评估深度代码模型鲁棒性的有效方法，未来需进一步解决现有挑战并推动领域发展。

Abstract: Large language models and deep learning models designed for code intelligence
have revolutionized the software engineering field due to their ability to
perform various code-related tasks. These models can process source code and
software artifacts with high accuracy in tasks such as code completion, defect
detection, and code summarization; therefore, they can potentially become an
integral part of modern software engineering practices. Despite these
capabilities, robustness remains a critical quality attribute for deep-code
models as they may produce different results under varied and adversarial
conditions (e.g., variable renaming). Metamorphic testing has become a widely
used approach to evaluate models' robustness by applying semantic-preserving
transformations to input programs and analyzing the stability of model outputs.
While prior research has explored testing deep learning models, this systematic
literature review focuses specifically on metamorphic testing for deep code
models. By studying 45 primary papers, we analyze the transformations,
techniques, and evaluation methods used to assess robustness. Our review
summarizes the current landscape, identifying frequently evaluated models,
programming tasks, datasets, target languages, and evaluation metrics, and
highlights key challenges and future directions for advancing the field.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software
engineering has sparked interest in their use for software vulnerability
detection. However, the rapid development of this field has resulted in a
fragmented research landscape, with diverse studies that are difficult to
compare due to differences in, e.g., system designs and dataset usage. This
fragmentation makes it difficult to obtain a clear overview of the
state-of-the-art or compare and categorize studies meaningfully. In this work,
we present a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of LLM-based
software vulnerability detection. We analyze 227 studies published between
January 2020 and June 2025, categorizing them by task formulation, input
representation, system architecture, and adaptation techniques. Further, we
analyze the datasets used, including their characteristics, vulnerability
coverage, and diversity. We present a fine-grained taxonomy of vulnerability
detection approaches, identify key limitations, and outline actionable future
research opportunities. By providing a structured overview of the field, this
review improves transparency and serves as a practical guide for researchers
and practitioners aiming to conduct more comparable and reproducible research.
We publicly release all artifacts and maintain a living repository of LLM-based
software vulnerability detection studies.

Motivation: 自主系统缺乏用户伦理偏好的个性化决策能力，影响用户信任和系统行为。

Method: 提出RobEthiChor架构，结合ROS实现伦理协商功能，并在真实机器人上测试。

Conclusion: RobEthiChor有效实现了伦理协商，提升了自主系统的伦理决策能力。

Abstract: The presence of autonomous systems is growing at a fast pace and it is
impacting many aspects of our lives. Designed to learn and act independently,
these systems operate and perform decision-making without human intervention.
However, they lack the ability to incorporate users' ethical preferences, which
are unique for each individual in society and are required to personalize the
decision-making processes. This reduces user trust and prevents autonomous
systems from behaving according to the moral beliefs of their end-users. When
multiple systems interact with differing ethical preferences, they must
negotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all the
parties involved and adjust their behavior consequently. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomous
systems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors into
their decision-making through ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor features a
domain-agnostic reference architecture for designing autonomous systems capable
of ethic-based negotiating. The paper also presents RobEthiChor-Ros, an
implementation of RobEthiChor within the Robot Operating System (ROS), which
can be deployed on robots to provide them with ethics-based negotiation
capabilities. To evaluate our approach, we deployed RobEthiChor-Ros on real
robots and ran scenarios where a pair of robots negotiate upon resource
contention. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness
of the system in realizing ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor allowed robots
to reach an agreement in more than 73\% of the scenarios with an acceptable
negotiation time (0.67s on average). Experiments also demonstrate that the
negotiation approach implemented in RobEthiChor is scalable.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出KnowledgeMind，一种基于蒙特卡洛树搜索和知识库奖励机制的LLM多智能体系统，用于解决微服务系统中根因分析（RCA）的挑战，显著提高了定位准确性并减少了上下文窗口负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务系统的灵活性和解耦性增加了可靠性挑战，需要快速准确的RCA方法。当前LLM框架存在幻觉和异常传播问题，且上下文窗口长度受限。

Method: 提出KnowledgeMind，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索和知识库奖励机制，实现标准化服务级推理，减少上下文窗口负担并抑制幻觉。

Result: 相比现有方法，定位准确性提升49.29%至128.35%，上下文窗口需求仅为十分之一。

Conclusion: KnowledgeMind通过多智能体和奖励机制，显著提升了RCA的效率和准确性，解决了LLM在复杂系统中的局限性。

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, due to the highly decoupled and flexible nature of
microservices, it poses greater challenges to system reliability. The more
frequent occurrence of incidents has created a demand for Root Cause
Analysis(RCA) methods that enable rapid identification and recovery of
incidents. Large language model (LLM) provides a new path for quickly locating
and recovering from incidents by leveraging their powerful generalization
ability combined with expert experience. Current LLM for RCA frameworks are
based on ideas like ReAct and Chain-of-Thought, but the hallucination of LLM
and the propagation nature of anomalies often lead to incorrect localization
results. Moreover, the massive amount of anomalous information generated in
large, complex systems presents a huge challenge for the context window length
of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose KnowledgeMind, an innovative
LLM multi-agent system based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and a knowledge base
reward mechanism for standardized service-by-service reasoning. Compared to
State-Of-The-Art(SOTA) LLM for RCA methods, our service-by-service exploration
approach significantly reduces the burden on the maximum context window length,
requiring only one-tenth of its size. Additionally, by incorporating a
rule-based real-time reward mechanism, our method effectively mitigates
hallucinations during the inference process. Compared to the SOTA LLM for RCA
framework, our method achieves a 49.29% to 128.35% improvement in root cause
localization accuracy.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Repair-R1提出了一种新的APR方法，通过在训练阶段引入测试用例，并将测试生成前置，以提高修复效果。实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-based APR方法在训练阶段未利用测试用例，且测试生成后置，限制了修复效果。

Method: Repair-R1在训练阶段引入测试用例，先生成区分性测试用例，再基于测试进行修复，结合RL优化。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，Repair-R1显著提升了修复成功率、测试生成成功率和覆盖率。

Conclusion: Repair-R1通过优化测试与修复的顺序和结合RL，显著提升了APR的效果。

Abstract: APR (Automated Program Repair) aims to automatically locate program defects,
generate patches and validate the repairs. Existing techniques for APR are
often combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the
code-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current
LLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference
stage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates
it through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two
important aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training
phase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address
this, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's
training phase and shifts test generation to precede repair. The model is
required to first generate discriminative test cases that can distinguish
defective behaviors, and then perform repair based on these tests. This enables
the model to better locate defects and understand the underlying causes of
defects, thereby improving repair effectiveness. We implement Repair-R1 with
three different backbone models, using RL (reinforcement learning) to
co-optimize test generation and bug repair. Experimental results on four widely
adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Repair-R1. Specially,
compared to vanilla models, Repair-R1 improves repair success rate by 2.68\% to
48.29\%, test generation success rate by 16.38\% to 53.28\%, and test coverage
by 0.78\% to 53.96\%. We publish the code and weights at

*Domhnall Carlin,Austen Rainer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究软件在科研中至关重要，但英国学术机构对其存储和注册情况的研究显示，软件作为研究成果的报告比例低，且共享率不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究软件是科研过程的重要组成部分，但如何将其作为研究产物进行识别和共享仍存在问题。

Method: 通过分析英国研究创新署（UKRI）的Gateway to Research（GtR）元数据，调查英国公开资助的研究软件的存储和注册情况。

Result: 研究发现，软件作为研究成果的报告比例较低，且共享率不足，其中45%的软件链接缺失或错误。GitHub是最大的公共代码托管平台。

Conclusion: 缺乏共享可能导致研究软件沦为短期工具，无法为更广泛的科学事业服务，强调了改进共享机制的必要性。

Abstract: Research software is crucial in the research process and the growth of Open
Science underscores the importance of accessing research artifacts, like data
and code, raising traceability challenges among outputs. While it is a clear
principle that research code, along with other essential outputs, should be
recognised as artifacts of the research process, the how of this principle
remains variable. This study examines where UK academic institutions store and
register software as a unique research output, searching the UKRI's Gateway to
Research (GtR) metadata for publicly funded research software in the UK. The
quantity of software reported as research outcomes remains low in proportion to
other categories. Artifact sharing appears low, with one-quarter of the
reported software having no links and 45% having either a missing or erroneous
URL. Of the valid URLs, we find the single largest category is Public
Commercial Code Repository, with GitHub being the host of 18% of all publicly
funded research software listed. These observations are contrasted with past
findings from 2023 and finally, we discuss the lack of artifact sharing in UK
research, with resulting implications for the maintenance and evolution of
research software. Without dissemination, research software risks demotion to a
transient artifact, useful only to meet short term research demands but
ultimately lost to the broader enterprise of science.

Result: 通过实验评估了两种算法（包括在线遗传算法），验证了OpenRASE在动态网络条件下的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: OpenRASE为SFC资源分配算法的研究提供了高保真、灵活且可扩展的工具，适用于动态网络环境。

Abstract: Service Function Chains (SFCs) are one of the key enablers in providing
programmable computer networks, paving the way for network autonomy. However,
this also introduces new challenges, such as resource allocation and
optimisation related to their operation, requiring new algorithms to address
these challenges. Various tools have been used in the literature to evaluate
these algorithms. However, these tools suffer from inaccuracy, low fidelity,
unscalability, inflexibility, or additional code requirements. This paper
introduces an emulator based on Mininet and Docker for SFCs called OpenRASE.
The goal of OpenRASE is to enable the exploration of resource allocation
algorithms for SFCs in a dynamic setting, allowing real CPU usage and latency
to be measured. We describe the design and implementation of OpenRASE and
discuss its characteristics. We also experimentally evaluate two different
algorithms to address the SFC resource allocation challenge, including an
online Genetic Algorithm, using OpenRASE to show its effectiveness and
practicality for dynamic network conditions.

Motivation: 物联网中传感器节点的精确定位是实际应用的基础需求，需要一种能在多样化环境中鲁棒定位的方法。

Method: 整合了SCA（全局搜索）和PSO（局部搜索），引入自适应切换模块，并对算法初始化、适应度评估和参数设置进行了优化。

Result: 仿真结果表明，相比单独PSO和未优化的SCAPSO算法，该方法显著减少迭代次数，平均定位误差降低84.97%。

Conclusion: 该混合算法在物联网节点定位中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于多样化环境。

Abstract: The accurate localization of sensor nodes is a fundamental requirement for
the practical application of the Internet of Things (IoT). To enable robust
localization across diverse environments, this paper proposes a hybrid
meta-heuristic localization algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm integrates
the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), which is effective in global search, with
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which excels at local search. An adaptive
switching module is introduced to dynamically select between the two
algorithms. Furthermore, the initialization, fitness evaluation, and parameter
settings of the algorithm have been specifically redesigned and optimized to
address the characteristics of the node localization problem. Simulation
results across varying numbers of sensor nodes demonstrate that, compared to
standalone PSO and the unoptimized SCAPSO algorithm, the proposed method
significantly reduces the number of required iterations and achieves an average
localization error reduction of 84.97%.

Motivation: 现代网络环境缺乏对物理空间的统一表示，导致空间访问策略等任务脆弱且依赖人工操作。

Method: 1. 提出基于bigraph的统一表示方法，整合空间、社交和通信关系；2. 设计分层代理架构，支持分布式空间推理和上下文感知执行。

Result: 实现了私密、可靠且低延迟的空间网络，能够安全地与代理工作流交互。

Conclusion: 该方法为现代网络环境中的空间协调提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern networked environments increasingly rely on spatial reasoning, but
lack a coherent representation for coordinating physical space. Consequently,
tasks such as enforcing spatial access policies remain fragile and manual. We
first propose a unifying representation based on bigraphs, capturing spatial,
social, and communication relationships within a single formalism, with
user-facing tools to generate bigraphs from physical environments. Second, we
present a hierarchical agent architecture for distributed spatial reasoning,
with runtimes for agentic processes to interact the spatial representation, and
a context-aware execution model that scopes reasoning to the smallest viable
subspace. Together, these enable private, reliable, and low-latency spatial
networking that can safely interact with agentic workflows.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of network infrastructure is bringing new challenges and

With very large monitoring databases becoming expensive to explore, the use of
AI and Generative AI can help reduce costs of managing these datasets. This
paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize network

pattern analysis. We leverage LLMs to enhance anomaly detection, automate
root-cause analysis, and automate incident analysis to build a well-monitored
network management team using AI. Through a real-world example of developing
our own OFCNetLLM, based on the open-source LLM model, we demonstrate practical
applications of OFCnetLLM in the OFC conference network. Our model is developed
as a multi-agent approach and is still evolving, and we present early results

TL;DR: Morph是一种LoRa编码器-解码器协同设计，旨在提升通信可靠性并提高计算效率，尤其在极低信噪比（SNR）环境下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRa编码器在商用节点上仅支持6种扩频因子（SF），限制了SNR容忍度。Morph旨在通过模拟更大的SF（如SF-12以上）来突破这一限制。

Method: 开发基于SF配置的编码器，通过操纵4种SF配置编码2位数据，并利用深度神经网络（DNN）解码器捕获多维特征以最大化SNR增益。

Result: 实验显示，Morph在-28.8dB SNR下可靠解码数据，比标准LoRa（SF-12）低6.4dB，且DNN解码器的计算效率提升3倍。

Conclusion: Morph通过编码器-解码器协同设计，显著提升了LoRa在低SNR环境下的性能和效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Morph, a LoRa encoder-decoder co-design to enhance
communication reliability while improving its computation efficiency in
extremely-low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) situations. The standard LoRa encoder
controls 6 Spreading Factors (SFs) to tradeoff SNR tolerance with data rate.
SF-12 is the maximum SF providing the lowest SNR tolerance on commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) LoRa nodes. In Morph, we develop an SF-configuration based
encoder to mimic the larger SFs beyond SF-12 while it is compatible with COTS
LoRa nodes. Specifically, we manipulate four SF configurations of a Morph
symbol to encode 2-bit data. Accordingly, we recognize the used SF
configuration of the symbol for data decoding. We leverage a Deep Neural
Network (DNN) decoder to fully capture multi-dimensional features among diverse
SF configurations to maximize the SNR gain. Moreover, we customize the input
size, neural network structure, and training method of the DNN decoder to
improve its efficiency, reliability, and generalizability. We implement Morph
with COTS LoRa nodes and a USRP N210, then evaluate its performance on indoor
and campus-scale testbeds. Results show that we can reliably decode data at
-28.8~dB SNR, which is 6.4~dB lower than the standard LoRa with SF-12 chirps.
In addition, the computation efficiency of our DNN decoder is about 3x higher
than state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言和视觉语言模型在处理需要逻辑推理和动态反馈的多模态指令时表现不佳。

Method: CIMR采用两阶段方法：初始推理和响应生成，随后通过多模态反馈进行迭代优化，并动态融合文本、视觉和上下文特征。

Result: 在Multi-modal Action Planning数据集上，CIMR以91.5%的准确率超越GPT-4V等现有最佳模型。

Conclusion: CIMR的迭代推理和自我修正能力在复杂任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enhanced our ability to process and generate
human language and visual information. However, these models often struggle
with complex, multi-step multi-modal instructions that require logical
reasoning, dynamic feedback integration, and iterative self-correction. To
address this, we propose CIMR: Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning, a
novel framework that introduces a context-aware iterative reasoning and
self-correction module. CIMR operates in two stages: initial reasoning and
response generation, followed by iterative refinement using parsed multi-modal
feedback. A dynamic fusion module deeply integrates textual, visual, and
contextual features at each step. We fine-tune LLaVA-1.5-7B on the Visual
Instruction Tuning (VIT) dataset and evaluate CIMR on the newly introduced
Multi-modal Action Planning (MAP) dataset. CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy,
outperforming state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4V (89.2%), LLaVA-1.5

Motivation: 无监督适应中，CLIP的零样本预测伪标签噪声大，传统固定阈值方法不可靠，需更鲁棒的伪标签优化方法。

Method: 结合原型一致性（PICS）和邻域一致性（NALR），动态优化伪标签，并引入自适应权重机制。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上实现最先进性能，伪标签更准确且计算高效。

Conclusion: 自适应伪标签框架显著提升CLIP的无监督适应能力，为复杂场景提供可靠解决方案。

Abstract: In unsupervised adaptation for vision-language models such as CLIP,
pseudo-labels derived from zero-shot predictions often exhibit significant
noise, particularly under domain shifts or in visually complex scenarios.
Conventional pseudo-label filtering approaches, which rely on fixed confidence
thresholds, tend to be unreliable in fully unsupervised settings. In this work,
we propose a novel adaptive pseudo-labeling framework that enhances CLIP's
adaptation performance by integrating prototype consistency and
neighborhood-based consistency. The proposed method comprises two key
components: PICS, which assesses pseudo-label accuracy based on in-class
feature compactness and cross-class feature separation; and NALR, which
exploits semantic similarities among neighboring samples to refine
pseudo-labels dynamically. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive weighting
mechanism that adjusts the influence of pseudo-labeled samples during training
according to their estimated correctness. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in
unsupervised adaptation scenarios, delivering more accurate pseudo-labels while
maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像（T2I）生成模型对提示词敏感，微小变化可能导致输出不一致或不准确。为解决这一问题，研究提出了一种无需额外训练的闭环优化方法。

Method: TIR框架在每次生成后，使用预训练的MLLM分析输出图像和用户提示，检测不一致（如缺失对象或错误属性），并生成更准确的提示进行下一轮生成。

Result: 实验表明，TIR在多个基准数据集上提升了图像与提示的对齐性和视觉连贯性，且无需修改黑盒T2I模型。

Conclusion: TIR通过闭环迭代优化提示，显著改善了T2I模型的输出质量，具有即插即用的优势。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have made significant strides but still
struggle with prompt sensitivity: even minor changes in prompt wording can
yield inconsistent or inaccurate outputs. To address this challenge, we
introduce a closed-loop, test-time prompt refinement framework that requires no
additional training of the underlying T2I model, termed TIR. In our approach,
each generation step is followed by a refinement step, where a pretrained
multimodal large language model (MLLM) analyzes the output image and the user's
prompt. The MLLM detects misalignments (e.g., missing objects, incorrect
attributes) and produces a refined and physically grounded prompt for the next
round of image generation. By iteratively refining the prompt and verifying
alignment between the prompt and the image, TIR corrects errors, mirroring the
iterative refinement process of human artists. We demonstrate that this
closed-loop strategy improves alignment and visual coherence across multiple
benchmark datasets, all while maintaining plug-and-play integration with
black-box T2I models.

Motivation: 随着有限元模拟精度提高但计算成本增加，以及数据驱动设计需求的增长，需要高效的优化方法。BO和MFBO虽在理论上有效，但缺乏在实际工程问题（如超材料设计）中的直接比较。

Method: 采用Sobol'采样和基于方差的敏感性分析降低设计问题复杂度，并比较BO和MFBO在优化自旋体结构EA问题中的表现。

Result: MFBO在优化自旋体结构EA问题时表现优于BO，最高提升11%。

Conclusion: MFBO在昂贵的数据驱动设计问题中具有实用价值，研究结果支持多保真度技术的应用。

Abstract: Finite element (FE) simulations of structures and materials are getting
increasingly more accurate, but also more computationally expensive as a
collateral result. This development happens in parallel with a growing demand
of data-driven design. To reconcile the two, a robust and data-efficient
optimization method called Bayesian optimization (BO) has been previously
established as a technique to optimize expensive objective functions. In
parallel, the mesh width of an FE model can be exploited to evaluate an
objective at a lower or higher fidelity (cost & accuracy) level. The
multi-fidelity setting applied to BO, called multi-fidelity BO (MFBO), has also
seen previous success. However, BO and MFBO have not seen a direct comparison
with when faced with with a real-life engineering problem, such as metamaterial
design for deformation and absorption qualities. Moreover, sampling quality and
assessing design parameter sensitivity is often an underrepresented part of
data-driven design. This paper aims to address these shortcomings by employing
Sobol' samples with variance-based sensitivity analysis in order to reduce
design problem complexity. Furthermore, this work describes, implements,
applies and compares the performance BO with that MFBO when maximizing the
energy absorption (EA) problem of spinodoid cellular structures is concerned.
The findings show that MFBO is an effective way to maximize the EA of a
spinodoid structure and is able to outperform BO by up to 11% across various
hyperparameter settings. The results, which are made open-source, serve to
support the utility of multi-fidelity techniques across expensive data-driven
design problems.

Result: 实验表明，SourceSplice在较少子集探索下能有效识别高任务效用的数据源子集。

Conclusion: SourceSplice在多种设置下表现出对决策选择的敏感性，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Data quality plays a pivotal role in the predictive performance of machine
learning (ML) tasks - a challenge amplified by the deluge of data sources
available in modern organizations.Prior work in data discovery largely focus on
metadata matching, semantic similarity or identifying tables that should be
joined to answer a particular query, but do not consider source quality for
high performance of the downstream ML task.This paper addresses the problem of
determining the best subset of data sources that must be combined to construct
the underlying training dataset for a given ML task.We propose SourceGrasp and
SourceSplice, frameworks designed to efficiently select a suitable subset of
sources that maximizes the utility of the downstream ML model.Both the
algorithms rely on the core idea that sources (or their combinations)
contribute differently to the task utility, and must be judiciously
chosen.While SourceGrasp utilizes a metaheuristic based on a greediness
criterion and randomization, the SourceSplice framework presents a source
selection mechanism inspired from gene splicing - a core concept used in
protein synthesis.We empirically evaluate our algorithms on three real-world
datasets and synthetic datasets and show that, with significantly fewer subset
explorations, SourceSplice effectively identifies subsets of data sources
leading to high task utility.We also conduct studies reporting the sensitivity
of SourceSplice to the decision choices under several settings.

### [49] [Hybrid activation functions for deep neural networks: S3 and S4 -- a novel approach to gradient flow optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22090)
*Sergii Kavun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种新型混合激活函数S3和S4，通过结合Sigmoid和Softsign的特性，解决了传统激活函数的梯度消失和神经元死亡问题。S4在多项任务中表现优异，具有更快的收敛速度和稳定的梯度流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统激活函数如ReLU存在神经元死亡问题，而Sigmoid和tanh则面临梯度消失问题。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了混合设计的激活函数。

Method: S3结合了Sigmoid（负输入）和Softsign（正输入），S4在此基础上引入了平滑过渡机制，并通过参数k控制。实验在多种任务和网络架构中进行。

Result: S4在MNIST、Iris分类和Boston Housing回归任务中表现最佳，准确率分别为97.4%、96.0%和MSE 18.7。其梯度范围更稳定，收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 混合激活函数（尤其是S4）通过其设计和可调参数k，为深度学习提供了更优的选择，是改进神经网络训练动态的有前景的方向。

Abstract: Activation functions are critical components in deep neural networks,
directly influencing gradient flow, training stability, and model performance.
Traditional functions like ReLU suffer from dead neuron problems, while sigmoid
and tanh exhibit vanishing gradient issues. We introduce two novel hybrid
activation functions: S3 (Sigmoid-Softsign) and its improved version S4
(smoothed S3). S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for
positive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a
steepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary
classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three
different neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance
compared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on
MNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression.
The function exhibited faster convergence (-19 for ReLU) and maintained stable
gradient flow across network depths. Comparative analysis revealed S4's
gradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep
networks. The S4 activation function addresses key limitations of existing
functions through its hybrid design and smooth transition mechanism. The
tunable parameter k allows adaptation to different tasks and network depths,
making S4 a versatile choice for deep learning applications. These findings
suggest that hybrid activation functions represent a promising direction for
improving neural network training dynamics.

Motivation: 解决现有个性化联邦学习方法依赖外部数据、模型解耦或部分学习策略的局限性，提升实用性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: MH-pFedHN和MH-pFedHNGD是高效、隐私友好的个性化联邦学习框架，适用于模型异构场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in personalized federated learning have focused on addressing
client model heterogeneity. However, most existing methods still require
external data, rely on model decoupling, or adopt partial learning strategies,
which can limit their practicality and scalability. In this paper, we revisit
hypernetwork-based methods and leverage their strong generalization
capabilities to design a simple yet effective framework for heterogeneous
personalized federated learning. Specifically, we propose MH-pFedHN, which
leverages a server-side hypernetwork that takes client-specific embedding
vectors as input and outputs personalized parameters tailored to each client's
heterogeneous model. To promote knowledge sharing and reduce computation, we
introduce a multi-head structure within the hypernetwork, allowing clients with
similar model sizes to share heads. Furthermore, we further propose
MH-pFedHNGD, which integrates an optional lightweight global model to improve
generalization. Our framework does not rely on external datasets and does not
require disclosure of client model architectures, thereby offering enhanced
privacy and flexibility. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and model
settings demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy, strong
generalization, and serves as a robust baseline for future research in
model-heterogeneous personalized federated learning.

*Molly Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合图神经网络（GNN）和循环神经网络（RNN）的时空强化学习方法，以优化通信网络中的分组路由问题，解决了传统RL方法在非马尔可夫环境和复杂网络拓扑中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习（RL）基于马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），但在实际通信网络中，环境状态往往不满足马尔可夫性，且传统RL方法难以捕捉复杂网络拓扑的空间关系。

Method: 提出了一种时空RL方法，利用GNN捕捉网络拓扑的空间动态，RNN处理时态流量模式，从而优化路由决策。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能和对网络拓扑变化的鲁棒性上均优于传统RL技术。

Conclusion: 结合GNN和RNN的时空RL方法能有效解决通信网络中的路由优化问题，为复杂动态环境提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a well-established approach for
optimizing packet routing in communication networks. Standard RL algorithms
typically are based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which assumes that
the current state of the environment provides all the necessary information for
system evolution and decision-making. However, this Markovian assumption is
invalid in many practical scenarios, making the MDP and RL frameworks
inadequate to produce the optimal solutions. Additionally, traditional RL
algorithms often employ function approximations (e.g., by neural networks) that
do not explicitly capture the spatial relationships inherent in environments
with complex network topologies. Communication networks are characterized by
dynamic traffic patterns and arbitrary numbers of nodes and links, which
further complicate the decision-making process. To address these challenges, we
propose a spatial-temporal RL approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to adequately capture the spatial
dynamics regarding network topology and temporal traffic patterns,
respectively, to enhance routing decisions. Our evaluation demonstrates that
the proposed method outperforms and is more robust to changes in the network
topology when compared with traditional RL techniques.

Motivation: 时间序列基础模型研究的兴起需要衡量时间序列数据集的相似性，以支持模型选择、微调和可视化等任务。

Method: 将时间序列数据集视为多元正态分布的实例，利用Wasserstein距离计算其相似性。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效识别相似数据集，并与推理损失高度相关（>0.60）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在时间序列数据集相似性度量中表现有效，尤其适用于基础模型的性能评估。

Abstract: The emergence of time-series foundation model research elevates the growing
need to measure the (dis)similarity of time-series datasets. A time-series
dataset similarity measure aids research in multiple ways, including model
selection, finetuning, and visualization. In this paper, we propose a
distribution-based method to measure time-series dataset similarity by
leveraging the Wasserstein distance. We consider a time-series dataset an
empirical instantiation of an underlying multivariate normal distribution
(MVN). The similarity between two time-series datasets is thus computed as the
Wasserstein distance between their corresponding MVNs. Comprehensive
experiments and visualization show the effectiveness of our approach.
Specifically, we show how the Wasserstein distance helps identify similar
time-series datasets and facilitates inference performance estimation of
foundation models in both out-of-distribution and transfer learning evaluation,
with high correlations between our proposed measure and the inference loss
(>0.60).

Motivation: 现有远程胎儿监测系统缺乏可解释性，父母难以理解原始CTG数据。

Method: 通过五个医学定义特征分解CTG信号，每个特征由一个专用代理分析，最后由聚合代理合成结果并提供自然语言解释。

Result: 在NeuroFetalNet数据集上，CTG-Insight达到96.4%的准确率和97.8%的F1分数，优于深度学习和单代理LLM基线。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种可解释且可扩展的CTG分析框架。

Abstract: Remote fetal monitoring technologies are becoming increasingly common. Yet,
most current systems offer limited interpretability, leaving expectant parents
with raw cardiotocography (CTG) data that is difficult to understand. In this
work, we present CTG-Insight, a multi-agent LLM system that provides structured
interpretations of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) signals.
Drawing from established medical guidelines, CTG-Insight decomposes each CTG
trace into five medically defined features: baseline, variability,
accelerations, decelerations, and sinusoidal pattern, each analyzed by a
dedicated agent. A final aggregation agent synthesizes the outputs to deliver a
holistic classification of fetal health, accompanied by a natural language
explanation. We evaluate CTG-Insight on the NeuroFetalNet Dataset and compare
it against deep learning models and the single-agent LLM baseline. Results show
that CTG-Insight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (96.4%) and F1-score
(97.8%) while producing transparent and interpretable outputs. This work
contributes an interpretable and extensible CTG analysis framework.

Abstract: Accurate load forecasting is essential to the operation of modern electric
power systems. Given the sensitivity of electricity demand to weather
variability and temporal dynamics, capturing non-linear patterns is essential
for long-term planning. This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine
learning models, Linear Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM), for forecasting system-wide electricity load up to one year in
advance. Midterm forecasting has shown to be crucial for maintenance
scheduling, resource allocation, financial forecasting, and market
participation. The paper places a focus on the use of a method called "Shapley
Additive Explanations" (SHAP) to improve model explainability. SHAP enables the
quantification of feature contributions, guiding informed feature engineering

Abstract: Historically, neuroscience has progressed by fragmenting into specialized
domains, each focusing on isolated modalities, tasks, or brain regions. While
fruitful, this approach hinders the development of a unified model of
cognition. Here, we introduce TRIBE, the first deep neural network trained to
predict brain responses to stimuli across multiple modalities, cortical areas
and individuals. By combining the pretrained representations of text, audio and
video foundational models and handling their time-evolving nature with a
transformer, our model can precisely model the spatial and temporal fMRI
responses to videos, achieving the first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain
encoding competition with a significant margin over competitors. Ablations show
that while unimodal models can reliably predict their corresponding cortical
networks (e.g. visual or auditory networks), they are systematically
outperformed by our multimodal model in high-level associative cortices.
Currently applied to perception and comprehension, our approach paves the way
towards building an integrative model of representations in the human brain.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在7B参数预训练模型上的有效性，展示了不同数据源扩展行为的差异。

Conclusion: 该方法能够支持数据驱动的决策，优化数据源选择和资源分配。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for optimizing domain-specific dataset construction
in foundation model training. Specifically, we seek a cost-efficient way to
estimate the quality of data sources (e.g. synthetically generated or filtered
web data, etc.) in order to make optimal decisions about resource allocation
for data sourcing from these sources for the stage two pre-training phase, aka
annealing, with the goal of specializing a generalist pre-trained model to
specific domains. Our approach extends the usual point estimate approaches, aka
micro-annealing, to estimating scaling laws by performing multiple annealing
runs of varying compute spent on data curation and training. This addresses a
key limitation in prior work, where reliance on point estimates for data
scaling decisions can be misleading due to the lack of rank invariance across
compute scales -- a phenomenon we confirm in our experiments. By systematically
analyzing performance gains relative to acquisition costs, we find that scaling
curves can be estimated for different data sources. Such scaling laws can
inform cost effective resource allocation across different data acquisition
methods (e.g. synthetic data), data sources (e.g. user or web data) and
available compute resources. We validate our approach through experiments on a
pre-trained model with 7 billion parameters. We adapt it to: a domain
well-represented in the pre-training data -- the medical domain, and a domain
underrepresented in the pretraining corpora -- the math domain. We show that
one can efficiently estimate the scaling behaviors of a data source by running
multiple annealing runs, which can lead to different conclusions, had one used
point estimates using the usual micro-annealing technique instead. This enables
data-driven decision-making for selecting and optimizing data sources.

Motivation: 传统智能体学习过于依赖外部目标和环境控制，导致智能体缺乏适应性。

Conclusion: 通过关注内部表征，表征赋能为智能体的真正自主学习和适应性提供了新方向。

Abstract: The pursuit of general intelligence has traditionally centered on external
objectives: an agent's control over its environments or mastery of specific
tasks. This external focus, however, can produce specialized agents that lack
adaptability. We propose representational empowerment, a new perspective
towards a truly agent-centric learning paradigm by moving the locus of control
inward. This objective measures an agent's ability to controllably maintain and
diversify its own knowledge structures. We posit that the capacity -- to shape
one's own understanding -- is an element for achieving better ``preparedness''
distinct from direct environmental influence. Focusing on internal
representations as the main substrate for computing empowerment offers a new
lens through which to design adaptable intelligent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CFM生成的路径偏离直线插值，导致生成速度慢且精度低，而现有改进方法依赖计算昂贵的OT。

Method: 提出W-CFM，通过Gibbs核加权训练对，恢复EOT耦合并保持边缘分布近似不变。

Result: W-CFM在合成和真实数据集上表现优于基线，保持计算效率的同时提升生成质量。

Conclusion: W-CFM在生成任务中高效且有效，解决了CFM的计算和性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Conditional flow matching (CFM) has emerged as a powerful framework for
training continuous normalizing flows due to its computational efficiency and
effectiveness. However, standard CFM often produces paths that deviate
significantly from straight-line interpolations between prior and target
distributions, making generation slower and less accurate due to the need for
fine discretization at inference. Recent methods enhance CFM performance by
inducing shorter and straighter trajectories but typically rely on
computationally expensive mini-batch optimal transport (OT). Drawing insights
from entropic optimal transport (EOT), we propose Weighted Conditional Flow
Matching (W-CFM), a novel approach that modifies the classical CFM loss by
weighting each training pair $(x, y)$ with a Gibbs kernel. We show that this
weighting recovers the entropic OT coupling up to some bias in the marginals,
and we provide the conditions under which the marginals remain nearly
unchanged. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between W-CFM and the
minibatch OT method in the large-batch limit, showing how our method overcomes
computational and performance bottlenecks linked to batch size. Empirically, we
test our method on unconditional generation on various synthetic and real
datasets, confirming that W-CFM achieves comparable or superior sample quality,
fidelity, and diversity to other alternative baselines while maintaining the
computational efficiency of vanilla CFM.

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于聚类的交叉验证策略，提出了一种结合Mini Batch K-Means和类分层的新技术，并在20个数据集上进行了实验比较。结果显示，该技术在平衡数据集上表现优异，但在不平衡数据集上传统分层交叉验证更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交叉验证在机器学习中至关重要，但传统方法可能无法充分代表数据多样性，导致性能估计偏差。本文旨在探索基于聚类的交叉验证策略，以改进模型评估。

Method: 提出了一种结合Mini Batch K-Means和类分层的新交叉验证技术，并在20个数据集上进行了实验，比较了不同策略的偏差、方差和计算成本。

Result: 在平衡数据集上，新技术的偏差和方差表现优于其他方法，但未显著降低计算成本；在不平衡数据集上，传统分层交叉验证表现更优。

Conclusion: 本文深化了对基于聚类的数据分割技术的理解，并验证了传统分层交叉验证在不平衡数据集中的有效性，为模型评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: Cross-validation plays a fundamental role in Machine Learning, enabling
robust evaluation of model performance and preventing overestimation on
training and validation data. However, one of its drawbacks is the potential to
create data subsets (folds) that do not adequately represent the diversity of
the original dataset, which can lead to biased performance estimates. The
objective of this work is to deepen the investigation of cluster-based
cross-validation strategies by analyzing the performance of different
clustering algorithms through experimental comparison. Additionally, a new
cross-validation technique that combines Mini Batch K-Means with class
stratification is proposed. Experiments were conducted on 20 datasets (both
balanced and imbalanced) using four supervised learning algorithms, comparing
cross-validation strategies in terms of bias, variance, and computational cost.
The technique that uses Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification
outperformed others in terms of bias and variance on balanced datasets, though
it did not significantly reduce computational cost. On imbalanced datasets,
traditional stratified cross-validation consistently performed better, showing
lower bias, variance, and computational cost, making it a safe choice for
performance evaluation in scenarios with class imbalance. In the comparison of
different clustering algorithms, no single algorithm consistently stood out as
superior. Overall, this work contributes to improving predictive model
evaluation strategies by providing a deeper understanding of the potential of
cluster-based data splitting techniques and reaffirming the effectiveness of
well-established strategies like stratified cross-validation. Moreover, it
highlights perspectives for increasing the robustness and reliability of model
evaluations, especially in datasets with clustering characteristics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CS-SHRED的新型深度学习架构，结合压缩感知（CS）和浅层循环解码器（SHRED），用于从不完整、压缩或损坏的数据中重建时空动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理稀疏传感器布局、噪声测量和不完整数据时表现不佳，因此需要一种更鲁棒的方法来恢复信号并保留细节特征。

Method: CS-SHRED通过结合CS技术和SHRED架构，采用基于批处理的前向框架和ℓ1正则化，并引入自适应损失函数（结合MSE、MAE和SNR正则化）来优化重建效果。

Result: 在多个复杂问题（如粘弹性流体流动、海面温度分布等）上，CS-SHRED显著提高了重建保真度，表现为更高的SSIM和PSNR值、更低的归一化误差和更好的LPIPS分数。

Conclusion: CS-SHRED通过联合训练CS和SHRED架构，结合LSTM序列模型和浅层解码网络，成为一种在环境、气候和科学数据分析中具有广泛应用前景的工具。

Abstract: We present $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$, a novel deep learning architecture that
integrates Compressed Sensing (CS) into a Shallow Recurrent Decoder
($\textbf{SHRED}$) to reconstruct spatiotemporal dynamics from incomplete,
compressed, or corrupted data. Our approach introduces two key innovations.
First, by incorporating CS techniques into the $\textbf{SHRED}$ architecture,
our method leverages a batch-based forward framework with $\ell_1$
regularization to robustly recover signals even in scenarios with sparse sensor
placements, noisy measurements, and incomplete sensor acquisitions. Second, an
adaptive loss function dynamically combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) terms with a piecewise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
regularization, which suppresses noise and outliers in low-SNR regions while
preserving fine-scale features in high-SNR regions.
  We validate $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ on challenging problems including
viscoelastic fluid flows, maximum specific humidity fields, sea surface
temperature distributions, and rotating turbulent flows. Compared to the
traditional $\textbf{SHRED}$ approach, $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ achieves
significantly higher reconstruction fidelity - as demonstrated by improved SSIM
and PSNR values, lower normalized errors, and enhanced LPIPS scores-thereby
providing superior preservation of small-scale structures and increased
robustness against noise and outliers.
  Our results underscore the advantages of the jointly trained CS and SHRED
design architecture which includes an LSTM sequence model for characterizing
the temporal evolution with a shallow decoder network (SDN) for modeling the
high-dimensional state space. The SNR-guided adaptive loss function for the
spatiotemporal data recovery establishes $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ as a promising
tool for a wide range of applications in environmental, climatic, and
scientific data analyses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决设施选址和路径优化（FLPO）这类NP难问题，其混合离散-连续结构和非凸目标导致传统方法效率低下。

Method: 整合最大熵原理（MEP）与最短路径网络（SPN），一种置换不变的编码器-解码器，实现高效梯度优化。

Result: SPN比MEP基线快100倍，最优性差距约6%；FLPO方法比元启发式基线成本低10倍，速度更快，且与Gurobi最优解匹配但快1500倍。

Conclusion: 结构化深度模型在大规模混合整数优化任务中表现出色，确立了ParaSDM问题的新标杆。

Abstract: We propose a scalable deep learning framework for parametrized sequential
decision-making (ParaSDM), where multiple agents jointly optimize discrete
action policies and shared continuous parameters. A key subclass of this
setting arises in Facility-Location and Path Optimization (FLPO), where
multi-agent systems must simultaneously determine optimal routes and facility
locations, aiming to minimize the cumulative transportation cost within the
network. FLPO problems are NP-hard due to their mixed discrete-continuous
structure and highly non-convex objective. To address this, we integrate the
Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) with a neural policy model called the Shortest
Path Network (SPN)-a permutation-invariant encoder-decoder that approximates
the MEP solution while enabling efficient gradient-based optimization over
shared parameters. The SPN achieves up to 100$\times$ speedup in policy
inference and gradient computation compared to MEP baselines, with an average
optimality gap of approximately 6% across a wide range of problem sizes. Our
FLPO approach yields over 10$\times$ lower cost than metaheuristic baselines
while running significantly faster, and matches Gurobi's optimal cost with
annealing at a 1500$\times$ speedup-establishing a new state of the art for
ParaSDM problems. These results highlight the power of structured deep models

TL;DR: 提出了一种内存高效的比特稀疏量化方法（MSQ），通过圆钳位量化器和正则化减少训练复杂性和内存需求，同时保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DNN在移动和边缘设备上的部署增加，模型效率优化变得至关重要，但现有比特级稀疏方法存在训练复杂性和高内存需求的问题。

Method: MSQ采用圆钳位量化器计算权重的LSBs，并通过正则化诱导稀疏性，结合Hessian信息同时修剪多个LSBs。

Result: 实验显示，MSQ可减少8倍可训练参数和86%训练时间，同时保持竞争性精度和压缩率。

Conclusion: MSQ是一种适用于资源受限设备的高效DNN训练方法。

Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) see increased deployment on mobile and edge
devices, optimizing model efficiency has become crucial. Mixed-precision
quantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between
efficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization. However, finding the
optimal precision for each layer is challenging. Recent studies utilizing
bit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial
training complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose
Memory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that
addresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable
differentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model
weights. It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs,
enabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter
splitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the
simultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency.
Experimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable
parameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous
bit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression
rates. This makes it a practical solution for training efficient DNNs on
resource-constrained devices.

TL;DR: Spec-VLA框架通过改进的推测解码技术加速Vision-Language-Action模型，提升生成速度44%，达到1.42倍加速，同时保持成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型因参数规模和自回归解码导致计算需求高，推测解码技术虽在LLMs中有效，但在VLA中应用尚未探索。

Result: 实验显示Spec-VLA显著提升生成速度（1.42倍加速），接受长度增加44%，且不影响成功率。

Conclusion: Spec-VLA框架证明了推测执行在VLA预测中的潜力，为更广泛应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made substantial progress by
leveraging the robust capabilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs). However,
VLMs' significant parameter size and autoregressive (AR) decoding nature impose
considerable computational demands on VLA models. While Speculative Decoding
(SD) has shown efficacy in accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs) by
incorporating efficient drafting and parallel verification, allowing multiple
tokens to be generated in one forward pass, its application to VLA models
remains unexplored. This work introduces Spec-VLA, an SD framework designed to
accelerate VLA models. Due to the difficulty of the action prediction task and
the greedy decoding mechanism of the VLA models, the direct application of the
advanced SD framework to the VLA prediction task yields a minor speed
improvement. To boost the generation speed, we propose an effective mechanism
to relax acceptance utilizing the relative distances represented by the action
tokens of the VLA model. Empirical results across diverse test scenarios affirm
the effectiveness of the Spec-VLA framework, and further analysis substantiates
the impact of our proposed strategies, which enhance the acceptance length by
44%, achieving 1.42 times speedup compared with the OpenVLA baseline, without
compromising the success rate. The success of the Spec-VLA framework highlights
the potential for broader application of speculative execution in VLA
prediction scenarios.

Conclusion: T-MIFPE能有效减少浮点误差，提升梯度对抗攻击的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial attacks using the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often
suffer from overestimation due to relative errors in gradient computation
induced by floating-point arithmetic. This paper provides a rigorous
theoretical analysis of these errors, conducting the first comprehensive study
of floating-point computation errors in gradient-based attacks across four
distinct scenarios: (i) unsuccessful untargeted attacks, (ii) successful
untargeted attacks, (iii) unsuccessful targeted attacks, and (iv) successful
targeted attacks. We establish theoretical foundations characterizing the
behavior of relative numerical errors under different attack conditions,
revealing previously unknown patterns in gradient computation instability, and
identify floating-point underflow and rounding as key contributors. Building on
this insight, we propose the Theoretical MIFPE (T-MIFPE) loss function, which
incorporates an optimal scaling factor $T = t^*$ to minimize the impact of
floating-point errors, thereby enhancing the accuracy of gradient computation
in adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that T-MIFPE outperforms existing loss
functions, including CE, C\&W, DLR, and MIFPE, in terms of attack potency and
robustness evaluation accuracy.

Conclusion: RANA通过噪声感知和去噪策略，显著提升了网络对齐模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Network alignment has attracted widespread attention in various fields.
However, most existing works mainly focus on the problem of label sparsity,
while overlooking the issue of noise in network alignment, which can
substantially undermine model performance. Such noise mainly includes
structural noise from noisy edges and labeling noise caused by human-induced
and process-driven errors. To address these problems, we propose RANA, a Robust
Active learning framework for noisy Network Alignment. RANA effectively tackles
both structure noise and label noise while addressing the sparsity of anchor
link annotations, which can improve the robustness of network alignment models.
Specifically, RANA introduces the proposed Noise-aware Selection Module and the
Label Denoising Module to address structural noise and labeling noise,
respectively. In the first module, we design a noise-aware maximization
objective to select node pairs, incorporating a cleanliness score to address
structural noise. In the second module, we propose a novel multi-source fusion
denoising strategy that leverages model and twin node pairs labeling to provide
more accurate labels for node pairs. Empirical results on three real-world
datasets demonstrate that RANA outperforms state-of-the-art active
learning-based methods in alignment accuracy. Our code is available at

Method: 提出RCR-AF激活函数，结合GELU的平滑性、梯度稳定性和负信息保留，以及ReLU的单调性，并通过超参数α和γ控制模型稀疏性和容量。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，RCR-AF在标准训练和对抗训练中均优于ReLU、GELU和Swish。

Conclusion: RCR-AF通过降低Rademacher复杂度，提供了一种增强模型鲁棒性的有效方法。

Abstract: Despite their widespread success, deep neural networks remain critically
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks in safety-sensitive
applications. This paper investigates activation functions as a crucial yet
underexplored component for enhancing model robustness. We propose a Rademacher
Complexity Reduction Activation Function (RCR-AF), a novel activation function
designed to improve both generalization and adversarial resilience. RCR-AF
uniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient
stability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable
monotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity
through built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\alpha$
and $\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity,
demonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher
complexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations show that RCR-AF consistently outperforms widely-used
alternatives (ReLU, GELU, and Swish) in both clean accuracy under standard
training and in adversarial robustness within adversarial training paradigms.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable prediction of estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) is essential for managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and supporting
clinical decisions. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have
shown strong potential in clinical prediction tasks due to their ability to
process visual and textual information. However, challenges related to
deployment cost, data privacy, and model reliability hinder their adoption. In
this study, we propose a collaborative framework that enhances the performance
of open-source LMMs for eGFR forecasting while generating clinically meaningful
explanations. The framework incorporates visual knowledge transfer, abductive
reasoning, and a short-term memory mechanism to enhance prediction accuracy and
interpretability. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
achieves predictive performance and interpretability comparable to proprietary
models. It also provides plausible clinical reasoning processes behind each
prediction. Our method sheds new light on building AI systems for healthcare
that combine predictive accuracy with clinically grounded interpretability.

Result: 在零样本场景下，Proto-EVFL比基线方法至少提升6.97%。

Conclusion: Proto-EVFL是首个双层次优化VFL框架，具有收敛性保证，能有效解决类不平衡问题。

Abstract: In vertical federated learning (VFL), multiple enterprises address aligned
sample scarcity by leveraging massive locally unaligned samples to facilitate
collaborative learning. However, unaligned samples across different parties in
VFL can be extremely class-imbalanced, leading to insufficient feature
representation and limited model prediction space. Specifically,
class-imbalanced problems consist of intra-party class imbalance and
inter-party class imbalance, which can further cause local model bias and
feature contribution inconsistency issues, respectively. To address the above
challenges, we propose Proto-EVFL, an enhanced VFL framework via dual
prototypes. We first introduce class prototypes for each party to learn
relationships between classes in the latent space, allowing the active party to
predict unseen classes. We further design a probabilistic dual prototype
learning scheme to dynamically select unaligned samples by conditional optimal
transport cost with class prior probability. Moreover, a mixed prior guided
module guides this selection process by combining local and global class prior
probabilities. Finally, we adopt an \textit{adaptive gated feature aggregation
strategy} to mitigate feature contribution inconsistency by dynamically
weighting and aggregating local features across different parties. We proved
that Proto-EVFL, as the first bi-level optimization framework in VFL, has a
convergence rate of 1/\sqrt T. Extensive experiments on various datasets
validate the superiority of our Proto-EVFL. Even in a zero-shot scenario with
one unseen class, it outperforms baselines by at least 6.97%

Conclusion: LoReUn是一种简单高效的机器遗忘策略，适用于提升生成模型的安全性。

Abstract: Recent generative models face significant risks of producing harmful content,
which has underscored the importance of machine unlearning (MU) as a critical
technique for eliminating the influence of undesired data. However, existing MU
methods typically assign the same weight to all data to be forgotten, which
makes it difficult to effectively forget certain data that is harder to unlearn
than others. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the loss of data
itself can implicitly reflect its varying difficulty. Building on this insight,
we introduce Loss-based Reweighting Unlearning (LoReUn), a simple yet effective
plug-and-play strategy that dynamically reweights data during the unlearning
process with minimal additional computational overhead. Our approach
significantly reduces the gap between existing MU methods and exact unlearning
in both image classification and generation tasks, effectively enhancing the
prevention of harmful content generation in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Forecast reconciliation, an ex-post technique applied to forecasts that must
satisfy constraints, has been a prominent topic in the forecasting literature
over the past two decades. Recently, several efforts have sought to extend
reconciliation methods to the probabilistic settings. Nevertheless, formal
theorems demonstrating error reduction in nonlinear contexts, analogous to
those presented in Panagiotelis et al.(2021), are still lacking. This paper
addresses that gap by establishing such theorems for various classes of
nonlinear hypersurfaces and vector-valued functions. Specifically, we derive an
exact analog of Theorem 3.1 from Panagiotelis et al.(2021) for hypersurfaces
with constant-sign curvature. Additionally, we provide probabilistic guarantees
for the broader case of hypersurfaces with non-constant-sign curvature and for
general vector-valued functions. To support reproducibility and practical
adoption, we release a JAX-based Python package, \emph{to be released upon
publication}, implementing the presented theorems and reconciliation
procedures.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is an increasingly critical task within drug
discovery and development. Typically, neural networks can learn molecular
properties using graph-based, language-based or feature-based methods. Recent
advances in natural language processing have highlighted the capabilities of
neural networks to learn complex human language using masked language
modelling. These approaches to training large transformer-based deep learning
models have also been used to learn the language of molecules, as represented
by simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings. Here, we
present novel domain-specific text-to-text pretraining tasks that yield
improved performance in six classification-based molecular property prediction
benchmarks, relative to both traditional likelihood-based training and
previously proposed fine-tuning tasks. Through ablation studies, we show that
data and computational efficiency can be improved by using these
domain-specific pretraining tasks. Finally, the pretrained embeddings from the
model can be used as fixed inputs into a downstream machine learning classifier
and yield comparable performance to finetuning but with much lower
computational overhead.

Abstract: Network compression techniques have become increasingly important in recent
years because the loads of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are heavy for edge
devices in real-world applications. While many methods compress neural network
parameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To
address this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP)
framework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian
function to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the
computational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we
introduce Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the
fractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each
kernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional
Gaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured
Pruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various
architectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent
methods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a
1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%. On ImageNet2012,
ResNet-50 achieves only a 1.63% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size

Abstract: Traffic congestion due to uncertainties, such as accidents, is a significant
issue in urban areas, as the ripple effect of accidents causes longer delays,
increased emissions, and safety concerns. To address this issue, we propose a
robust framework for predicting the impact of accidents on congestion. We
implement Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)-enhanced Deep Embedding
Clustering (DEC) to assign congestion labels to accident data and predict
congestion probability using a Bayesian Network (BN). The Simulation of Urban
Mobility (SUMO) simulation is utilized to evaluate the correctness of BN
predictions using evidence-based scenarios. Results demonstrate that the
AutoML-enhanced DEC has outperformed traditional clustering approaches. The
performance of the proposed BN model achieved an overall accuracy of 95.6%,
indicating its ability to understand the complex relationship of accidents
causing congestion. Validation in SUMO with evidence-based scenarios
demonstrated that the BN model's prediction of congestion states closely
matches those of SUMO, indicating the high reliability of the proposed BN model
in ensuring smooth urban mobility.

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP) and
other sequence modeling domains, where the choice of vocabulary size
significantly impacts model performance. Despite its importance, selecting an
optimal vocabulary size remains underexplored, typically relying on heuristics
or dataset-specific choices. In this work, we propose a principled method for
determining the vocabulary size by analyzing token frequency distributions
through Zipf's law. We show that downstream task performance correlates with
how closely token distributions follow power-law behavior, and that aligning

Abstract: We describe a thermodynamic-inspired computing paradigm based on oscillatory

for tackling complex combinatorial optimization problems, this work
investigates their feasibility in solving linear algebra problems, specifically
the inverse matrix. Grounded in thermodynamic principles, we analytically
demonstrate that the linear approximation of the coupled Kuramoto oscillator
model leads to the inverse matrix solution. Numerical simulations validate the
theoretical framework, and we examine the parameter regimes that computation

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如GEM和METEOR）在粗粒度到细粒度映射中与本地普查数据不一致及模型不确定性的问题。

Result: 在卢旺达的第三级行政单位中，改进了城市形态、建筑暴露和物理脆弱性的地图质量。

Conclusion: DeepC4为大规模空间审计提供了一种新的深度学习方法，有助于实现可持续发展目标。

Abstract: To understand our global progress for sustainable development and disaster
risk reduction in many developing economies, two recent major initiatives - the
Uniform African Exposure Dataset of the Global Earthquake Model (GEM)
Foundation and the Modelling Exposure through Earth Observation Routines
(METEOR) Project - implemented classical spatial disaggregation techniques to
generate large-scale mapping of urban morphology using the information from
various satellite imagery and its derivatives, geospatial datasets of the built
environment, and subnational census statistics. However, the local discrepancy
with well-validated census statistics and the propagated model uncertainties
remain a challenge in such coarse-to-fine-grained mapping problems,
specifically constrained by weak and conditional label supervision. Therefore,
we present Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering (DeepC4), a novel
deep learning-based spatial disaggregation approach that incorporates local
census statistics as cluster-level constraints while considering multiple
conditional label relationships in a joint multitask learning of the patterns
of satellite imagery. To demonstrate, compared to GEM and METEOR, we enhanced
the quality of Rwandan maps of urban morphology, specifically building exposure
and physical vulnerability, at the third-level administrative unit from the
2022 census. As the world approaches the conclusion of our global frameworks in
2030, our work has offered a new deep learning-based mapping technique towards
a spatial auditing of our existing coarse-grained derived information at large
scales.

Method: 结合热图和散点图，VAR方案实现模型间的水平比较。

Result: VAR帮助开发者识别特定条件下的最优模型，并理解Rashomon集合的整体特征。

Conclusion: VAR为机器学习模型的水平比较提供了有效的可视化工具。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of closely matched machine learning(ML) models
under specific conditions has long been a focus of researchers in the field of
machine learning. The Rashomon set is a collection of closely matched ML
models, encompassing a wide range of models with similar accuracies but
different structures. Traditionally, the analysis of these sets has focused on
vertical structural analysis, which involves comparing the corresponding
features at various levels within the ML models. However, there has been a lack
of effective visualization methods for horizontally comparing multiple models
with specific features. We propose the VAR visualization solution. VAR uses
visualization to perform comparisons of ML models within the Rashomon set. This
solution combines heatmaps and scatter plots to facilitate the comparison. With
the help of VAR, ML model developers can identify the optimal model under
specific conditions and better understand the Rashomon set's overall
characteristics.

Motivation: 解决差分隐私优化中全局固定参数导致的隐私预算浪费或模型性能下降问题。

Method: 利用强化学习（SAC）动态选择细粒度的梯度裁剪阈值和噪声大小，优化隐私预算分配。

Result: 在多个模型上，RLDP降低了困惑度1.3-30.5%，平均提升下游任务性能5.6%，同时节省71%的梯度更新预算。

Conclusion: RLDP在保证相同隐私保护水平下，显著提升了模型效率和性能。

Abstract: The tension between data privacy and model utility has become the defining
bottleneck for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) trained
on sensitive corpora including healthcare. Differentially private stochastic
gradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a
pronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise,
degrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been
proposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control
knobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization
landscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy
budget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay
within privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP
optimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep
reinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the
learning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter
gradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian
noise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language
model fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget
where it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation
experiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers
perplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream
utility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of
the gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same
($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility
to membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.

Conclusion: 该方法首次系统性地利用机器学习为单调矩阵分类提供了实用标准，展示了深度学习在抽象代数问题中的潜力。

Abstract: This work demonstrates a methodology for using deep learning to discover
simple, practical criteria for classifying matrices based on abstract algebraic
properties. By combining a high-performance neural network with explainable AI
(XAI) techniques, we can distill a model's learned strategy into
human-interpretable rules. We apply this approach to the challenging case of
monotone matrices, defined by the condition that their inverses are entrywise
nonnegative. Despite their simple definition, an easy characterization in terms
of the matrix elements or the derived parameters is not known. Here, we
present, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic machine-learning
approach for deriving a practical criterion that distinguishes monotone from
non-monotone matrices. After establishing a labelled dataset by randomly
generated monotone and non-monotone matrices uniformly on $(-1,1)$, we employ
deep neural network algorithms for classifying the matrices as monotone or
non-monotone, using both their entries and a comprehensive set of matrix
features. By saliency methods, such as integrated gradients, we identify among
all features, two matrix parameters which alone provide sufficient information
for the matrix classification, with $95\%$ accuracy, namely the absolute values
of the two lowest-order coefficients, $c_0$ and $c_1$ of the matrix's
characteristic polynomial. A data-driven study of 18,000 random $7\times7$
matrices shows that the monotone class obeys $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert\le0.18$
with probability $>99.98\%$; because $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert =
1/\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})$ for monotone $A$, this is equivalent to the simple bound
$\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})\ge5.7$.

Result: 模型能够解释传统几何规则无法处理的胚胎分裂模式，展示了深度学习在理解细胞分裂中的潜力。

Conclusion: 深度学习为细胞分裂模式研究提供了新视角，并能生成关于分裂定位控制的新假设。

Abstract: The positioning of new cellular walls during cell division plays a key role
in shaping plant tissue organization. The influence of cell geometry on the
positioning of division planes has been previously captured into various
geometrical rules. Accordingly, linking cell shape to division orientation has
relied on the comparison between observed division patterns and predictions
under specific rules. The need to define a priori the tested rules is a
fundamental limitation of this hypothesis-driven approach. As an alternative,
we introduce a data-based approach to investigate the relation between cell
geometry and division plane positioning, exploiting the ability of deep neural
network to learn complex relationships across multidimensional spaces. Adopting
an image-based cell representation, we show how division patterns can be
learned and predicted from mother cell geometry using a UNet architecture
modified to operate on cell masks. Using synthetic data and A. thaliana embryo
cells, we evaluate the model performances on a wide range of diverse cell
shapes and division patterns. We find that the trained model accounted for
embryo division patterns that were previously irreconcilable under existing
geometrical rules. Our work shows the potential of deep networks to understand
cell division patterns and to generate new hypotheses on the control of cell
division positioning.

Abstract: Different from existing federated fine-tuning (FFT) methods for foundation
models, hybrid heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (HHFFT) is an under-explored
scenario where clients exhibit double heterogeneity in model architectures and
downstream tasks. This hybrid heterogeneity introduces two significant
challenges: 1) heterogeneous matrix aggregation, where clients adopt different
large-scale foundation models based on their task requirements and resource
limitations, leading to dimensional mismatches during LoRA parameter
aggregation; and 2) multi-task knowledge interference, where local shared
parameters, trained with both task-shared and task-specific knowledge, cannot
ensure only task-shared knowledge is transferred between clients. To address
these challenges, we propose H2Tune, a federated foundation model fine-tuning
with hybrid heterogeneity. Our framework H2Tune consists of three key
components: (i) sparsified triple matrix decomposition to align hidden
dimensions across clients through constructing rank-consistent middle matrices,
with adaptive sparsification based on client resources; (ii) relation-guided
matrix layer alignment to handle heterogeneous layer structures and
representation capabilities; and (iii) alternating task-knowledge
disentanglement mechanism to decouple shared and specific knowledge of local
model parameters through alternating optimization. Theoretical analysis proves
a convergence rate of O(1/\sqrt{T}). Extensive experiments show our method
achieves up to 15.4% accuracy improvement compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. Our code is available at

Abstract: Transductive learning is a supervised machine learning task in which, unlike
in traditional inductive learning, the unlabelled data that require labelling
are a finite set and are available at training time. Similarly to inductive
learning contexts, transductive learning contexts may be affected by dataset
shift, i.e., may be such that the IID assumption does not hold. We here propose
a method, tailored to transductive classification contexts, for performing
model selection (i.e., hyperparameter optimisation) when the data exhibit prior
probability shift, an important type of dataset shift typical of anti-causal
learning problems. In our proposed method the hyperparameters can be optimised
directly on the unlabelled data to which the trained classifier must be
applied; this is unlike traditional model selection methods, that are based on
performing cross-validation on the labelled training data. We provide
experimental results that show the benefits brought about by our method.

Abstract: Random forests are a machine learning method used to automatically classify
datasets and consist of a multitude of decision trees. While these random
forests often have higher performance and generalize better than a single
decision tree, they are also harder to interpret. This paper presents a
visualization method and system to increase interpretability of random forests.
We cluster similar trees which enables users to interpret how the model
performs in general without needing to analyze each individual decision tree in
detail, or interpret an oversimplified summary of the full forest. To
meaningfully cluster the decision trees, we introduce a new distance metric
that takes into account both the decision rules as well as the predictions of a
pair of decision trees. We also propose two new visualization methods that
visualize both clustered and individual decision trees: (1) The Feature Plot,
which visualizes the topological position of features in the decision trees,
and (2) the Rule Plot, which visualizes the decision rules of the decision
trees. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a case study on the
"Glass" dataset, which is a relatively complex standard machine learning
dataset, as well as a small user study.

Result: PQK在CAR T细胞毒性预测中表现优于经典机器学习方法，特别是在信号域和域位置信息较少的情况下。

Conclusion: 量子计算在数据受限的生物医学问题中具有显著潜力，尤其是针对复杂组合优化问题。

Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are T-cells engineered to recognize
and kill specific tumor cells. Through their extracellular domains, CAR T-cells
bind tumor cell antigens which triggers CAR T activation and proliferation.
These processes are regulated by co-stimulatory domains present in the
intracellular region of the CAR T-cell. Through integrating novel signaling
components into the co-stimulatory domains, it is possible to modify CAR T-cell
phenotype. Identifying and experimentally testing new CAR constructs based on
libraries of co-stimulatory domains is nontrivial given the vast combinatorial
space defined by such libraries. This leads to a highly data constrained,
poorly explored combinatorial problem, where the experiments undersample all
possible combinations. We propose a quantum approach using a Projected Quantum
Kernel (PQK) to address this challenge. PQK operates by embedding classical
data into a high dimensional Hilbert space and employs a kernel method to
measure sample similarity. Using 61 qubits on a gate-based quantum computer, we
demonstrate the largest PQK application to date and an enhancement in the
classification performance over purely classical machine learning methods for
CAR T cytotoxicity prediction. Importantly, we show improved learning for
specific signaling domains and domain positions, particularly where there was
lower information highlighting the potential for quantum computing in
data-constrained problems.

Abstract: Sensor-based sorting systems enable the physical separation of a material
stream into two fractions. The sorting decision is based on the image data
evaluation of the sensors used and is carried out using actuators. Various
process parameters must be set depending on the properties of the material
stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the required sorting accuracy.
However, continuous verification and re-adjustment are necessary due to
changing requirements and material stream compositions. In this paper, we
introduce an approach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting the
process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based on Bayesian
Optimization, Gaussian process regression models are used as surrogate models
to achieve specific requirements for system behavior with the uncertainties
contained therein. This method minimizes the number of necessary experiments
while simultaneously considering two possible optimization targets based on the
requirements for both material output streams. In addition, uncertainties are
considered during determining sorting accuracies in the model calculation. We
evaluated the method with three example process parameters.

Abstract: Distilling large neural networks into simple, human-readable symbolic
formulas is a promising path toward trustworthy and interpretable AI. However,
this process is often brittle, as the complex functions learned by standard
networks are poor targets for symbolic discovery, resulting in low-fidelity
student models. In this work, we propose a novel training paradigm to address
this challenge. Instead of passively distilling a pre-trained network, we
introduce a \textbf{Jacobian-based regularizer} that actively encourages the
``teacher'' network to learn functions that are not only accurate but also
inherently smoother and more amenable to distillation. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments on a suite of real-world regression benchmarks that our
method is highly effective. By optimizing the regularization strength for each
problem, we improve the $R^2$ score of the final distilled symbolic model by an
average of \textbf{120\% (relative)} compared to the standard distillation
pipeline, all while maintaining the teacher's predictive accuracy. Our work
presents a practical and principled method for significantly improving the
fidelity of interpretable models extracted from complex neural networks.

Conclusion: 研究强调了在医学AI模型的后市场监测中，需要更好地理解真实世界部署环境，以改进性能监测技术。

Abstract: Performance monitoring is essential for safe clinical deployment of image
classification models. However, because ground-truth labels are typically
unavailable in the target dataset, direct assessment of real-world model
performance is infeasible. State-of-the-art performance estimation methods
address this by leveraging confidence scores to estimate the target accuracy.
Despite being a promising direction, the established methods mainly estimate
the model's accuracy and are rarely evaluated in a clinical domain, where
strong class imbalances and dataset shifts are common. Our contributions are
twofold: First, we introduce generalisations of existing performance prediction
methods that directly estimate the full confusion matrix. Then, we benchmark
their performance on chest x-ray data in real-world distribution shifts as well
as simulated covariate and prevalence shifts. The proposed confusion matrix
estimation methods reliably predicted clinically relevant counting metrics on
medical images under distribution shifts. However, our simulated shift
scenarios exposed important failure modes of current performance estimation
techniques, calling for a better understanding of real-world deployment
contexts when implementing these performance monitoring techniques for
postmarket surveillance of medical AI models.

Abstract: Density operators, quantum generalizations of probability distributions, are
gaining prominence in machine learning due to their foundational role in
quantum computing. Generative modeling based on density operator models
(\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such
as those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data,
such as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a
fundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable
models on real-world datasets. \textit{In this paper, we develop an
Expectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined
through \textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those
used for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However,
designing such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined
quantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation
step. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum
information projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map
provides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we
introduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an
iterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence
lower bound. We show that the \textbf{DO-EM} algorithm ensures non-decreasing
log-likelihood across iterations for a broad class of models. Finally, we
present Quantum Interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines (\textbf{QiDBMs}), a
\textbf{DOM} that can be trained with the same resources as a DBM. When trained
with \textbf{DO-EM} under Contrastive Divergence, a \textbf{QiDBM} outperforms
larger classical DBMs in image generation on the MNIST dataset, achieving a
40--60\% reduction in the Fr\'echet Inception Distance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become an increasingly
popular paradigm for training large language models (LLMs) and diffusion
models. While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress,
they often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows
and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may
encounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement,
and efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in
scenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this
paper, we present \textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF
training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a

orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single

Motivation: 传统基于规则的方法可能忽略异常事件，而基础模型能更全面地分析患者住院数据，提高预测准确性。

Method: 利用基础模型分析患者住院数据的上下文，识别信息量高的标记和事件，并筛选可忽略的低信息量事件。

Abstract: We present a foundation model-derived method to identify highly informative
tokens and events in electronic health records. Our approach considers incoming
data in the entire context of a patient's hospitalization and so can flag
anomalous events that rule-based approaches would consider within a normal
range. We demonstrate that the events our model flags are significant for
predicting downstream patient outcomes and that a fraction of events identified
as carrying little information can safely be dropped. Additionally, we show how
informativeness can help interpret the predictions of prognostic models trained
on foundation model-derived representations.

Result: 在多个ImageNet预训练架构中，提取的特征具有高分辨率和感知对齐性。

Conclusion: 神经网络依赖可解释的学习模式，这对知识发现和可信AI系统有重要意义。

Abstract: In this paper we argue that ReLU networks learn an implicit linear model we
can actually tap into. We describe that alleged model formally and show that we
can approximately pull its decision boundary back to the input space with
certain simple modification to the backward pass. The resulting gradients
(called excitation pullbacks) reveal high-resolution input- and target-specific
features of remarkable perceptual alignment on a number of popular
ImageNet-pretrained deep architectures. This strongly suggests that neural
networks do, in fact, rely on learned interpretable patterns that can be
recovered after training. Thus, our findings may have profound implications for
knowledge discovery and the development of dependable artificial systems.

Abstract: Accurate quality prediction in multi-process manufacturing is critical for
industrial efficiency but hindered by three core challenges: time-lagged
process interactions, overlapping operations with mixed periodicity, and
inter-process dependencies in shared frequency bands. To address these, we
propose PAF-Net, a frequency decoupled time series prediction framework with
three key innovations: (1) A phase-correlation alignment method guided by
frequency domain energy to synchronize time-lagged quality series, resolving
temporal misalignment. (2) A frequency independent patch attention mechanism
paired with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) decomposition to capture
heterogeneous operational features within individual series. (3) A frequency
decoupled cross attention module that suppresses noise from irrelevant
frequencies, focusing exclusively on meaningful dependencies within shared
bands. Experiments on 4 real-world datasets demonstrate PAF-Net's superiority.
It outperforms 10 well-acknowledged baselines by 7.06% lower MSE and 3.88%
lower MAE. Our code is available at

TL;DR: RLVMR框架通过引入过程级监督和元推理行为奖励，解决了强化学习中低效探索的问题，提升了推理质量和任务成功率。


<details>

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法仅优化最终任务成功率，导致推理路径低效且泛化能力差，需要改进。

Method: RLVMR整合了密集的过程级监督，通过程序化规则奖励元推理行为，并结合无评论家策略梯度方法优化。

Result: 在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld基准测试中，RLVMR达到83.6%的成功率，推理质量和效率显著提升。

Conclusion: RLVMR通过过程奖励和元推理行为，实现了更鲁棒、高效且可解释的智能体。

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for complex, long-horizon tasks is a
central goal in AI. However, dominant training paradigms face a critical
limitation: reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize solely for final
task success often reinforce flawed or inefficient reasoning paths, a problem
we term inefficient exploration. This leads to agents that are brittle and fail
to generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason
coherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel framework that
integrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding
verifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors. RLVMR equips an agent to explicitly tag
its cognitive steps, such as planning, exploration, and reflection, and
provides programmatic, rule-based rewards for actions that contribute to
effective problem-solving. These process-centric rewards are combined with the
final outcome signal and optimized using a critic-free policy gradient method.
On the challenging ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, RLVMR achieves new
state-of-the-art results, with our 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on
the most difficult unseen task split. Our analysis confirms these gains stem
from improved reasoning quality, including significant reductions in redundant
actions and enhanced error recovery, leading to more robust, efficient, and
interpretable agents.

Motivation: 解决传统分散式PCA方法中每个智能体需访问完整样本空间的限制，同时保护数据隐私。

Method: 通过共享局部嵌入并添加高斯噪声，结合随机初始化的隐私保护，实现差分隐私和协作估计。

Result: 算法满足(ε,δ)-差分隐私，收敛速度快，在中等隐私范围内表现优异。

Conclusion: D-DP-PM在隐私与效用之间取得良好平衡，适用于多智能体网络中的PCA任务。

Abstract: We propose a novel Decentralized Differentially Private Power Method
(D-DP-PM) for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in networked
multi-agent settings. Unlike conventional decentralized PCA approaches where
each agent accesses the full n-dimensional sample space, we address the
challenging scenario where each agent observes only a subset of dimensions
through row-wise data partitioning. Our method ensures
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy (DP) while enabling collaborative
estimation of global eigenvectors across the network without requiring a
central aggregator. We achieve this by having agents share only local
embeddings of the current eigenvector iterate, leveraging both the inherent
privacy from random initialization and carefully calibrated Gaussian noise
additions. We prove that our algorithm satisfies the prescribed
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee and establish convergence rates that
explicitly characterize the impact of the network topology. Our theoretical
analysis, based on linear dynamics and high-dimensional probability theory,
provides tight bounds on both privacy and utility. Experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that D-DP-PM achieves superior privacy-utility tradeoffs
compared to naive local DP approaches, with particularly strong performance in
moderate privacy regimes ($\epsilon\in[2, 5]$). The method converges rapidly,
allowing practitioners to trade iterations for enhanced privacy while
maintaining competitive utility.

Conclusion: 通过量子算法和生成式模型，显著提升了MDP学习的效率，尤其在时间依赖和参数依赖方面表现突出。

Abstract: We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning
finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative
reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,
freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by
having access to a "simulator". By employing known classical and new quantum
algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within
our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms
from RL like "optimism in the face of uncertainty" and "posterior sampling" and
instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret
bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum
algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number
of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This
matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.
(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other
parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For
infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the
$O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we
propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to
which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret,
exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise
all of our results to compact state spaces.

Conclusion: 本文为非凸内源性模糊下的随机微积分提供了严格的理论基础，显著区别于传统的凸范式。

Abstract: The canonical theory of sublinear expectations, a foundation of stochastic
calculus under ambiguity, is insensitive to the non-convex geometry of
primitive uncertainty models. This paper develops a new stochastic calculus for
a structured class of such non-convex models. We introduce a class of fully
coupled Mean-Field Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations where the
BSDE driver is defined by a pointwise maximization over a law-dependent,
non-convex set. Mathematical tractability is achieved via a uniform strong
concavity assumption on the driver with respect to the control variable, which
ensures the optimization admits a unique and stable solution. A central
contribution is to establish the Lipschitz stability of this optimizer from
primitive geometric and regularity conditions, which underpins the entire
well-posedness theory. We prove local and global well-posedness theorems for
the FBSDE system. The resulting valuation functional, the $\Theta$-Expectation,
is shown to be dynamically consistent and, most critically, to violate the
axiom of sub-additivity. This, along with its failure to be translation
invariant, demonstrates its fundamental departure from the convex paradigm.
This work provides a rigorous foundation for stochastic calculus under a class
of non-convex, endogenous ambiguity.

Conclusion: 研究为实际数据集成问题提供了理论指导，优化加权方案显著提升了方法性能。

Abstract: Modern data analysis increasingly requires identifying shared latent
structure across multiple high-dimensional datasets. A commonly used model
assumes that the data matrices are noisy observations of low-rank matrices with
a shared singular subspace. In this case, two primary methods have emerged for
estimating this shared structure, which vary in how they integrate information
across datasets. The first approach, termed Stack-SVD, concatenates all the
datasets, and then performs a singular value decomposition (SVD). The second
approach, termed SVD-Stack, first performs an SVD separately for each dataset,
then aggregates the top singular vectors across these datasets, and finally
computes a consensus amongst them. While these methods are widely used, they
have not been rigorously studied in the proportional asymptotic regime, which
is of great practical relevance in today's world of increasing data size and
dimensionality. This lack of theoretical understanding has led to uncertainty
about which method to choose and limited the ability to fully exploit their
potential. To address these challenges, we derive exact expressions for the
asymptotic performance and phase transitions of these two methods and develop
optimal weighting schemes to further improve both methods. Our analysis reveals
that while neither method uniformly dominates the other in the unweighted case,
optimally weighted Stack-SVD dominates optimally weighted SVD-Stack. We extend
our analysis to accommodate multiple shared components, and provide practical
algorithms for estimating optimal weights from data, offering theoretical
guidance for method selection in practical data integration problems. Extensive
numerical simulations and semi-synthetic experiments on genomic data
corroborate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic framework, termed LVM-GP, for uncertainty
quantification in solving forward and inverse partial differential equations
(PDEs) with noisy data. The core idea is to construct a stochastic mapping from
the input to a high-dimensional latent representation, enabling
uncertainty-aware prediction of the solution. Specifically, the architecture
consists of a confidence-aware encoder and a probabilistic decoder. The encoder
implements a high-dimensional latent variable model based on a Gaussian process
(LVM-GP), where the latent representation is constructed by interpolating
between a learnable deterministic feature and a Gaussian process prior, with
the interpolation strength adaptively controlled by a confidence function
learned from data. The decoder defines a conditional Gaussian distribution over
the solution field, where the mean is predicted by a neural operator applied to
the latent representation, allowing the model to learn flexible
function-to-function mapping. Moreover, physical laws are enforced as soft
constraints in the loss function to ensure consistency with the underlying PDE
structure. Compared to existing approaches such as Bayesian physics-informed
neural networks (B-PINNs) and deep ensembles, the proposed framework can
efficiently capture functional dependencies via merging a latent Gaussian
process and neural operator, resulting in competitive predictive accuracy and
robust uncertainty quantification. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and reliability of the method.

Abstract: Domain adaptation seeks to leverage the abundant label information in a
source domain to improve classification performance in a target domain with
limited labels. While the field has seen extensive methodological development,
its theoretical foundations remain relatively underexplored. Most existing
theoretical analyses focus on simplified settings where the source and target
domains share the same input space and relate target-domain performance to
measures of domain discrepancy. Although insightful, these analyses may not
fully capture the behavior of modern approaches that align domains into a
shared space via feature transformations. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive theoretical study of domain adaptation algorithms based on domain
alignment. We consider the joint learning of domain-aligning feature
transformations and a shared classifier in a semi-supervised setting. We first
derive generalization bounds in a broad setting, in terms of covering numbers
of the relevant function classes. We then extend our analysis to characterize
the sample complexity of domain-adaptive neural networks employing maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) or adversarial objectives. Our results rely on a rigorous
analysis of the covering numbers of these architectures. We show that, for both
MMD-based and adversarial models, the sample complexity admits an upper bound
that scales quadratically with network depth and width. Furthermore, our
analysis suggests that in semi-supervised settings, robustness to limited
labeled target data can be achieved by scaling the target loss proportionally
to the square root of the number of labeled target samples. Experimental
evaluation in both shallow and deep settings lends support to our theoretical
findings.

Conclusion: 新框架不仅减轻了手动设计架构的负担，还提高了CNN的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of machine learning tasks by leveraging hierarchical feature
learning through deep architectures. However, the large number of layers and
millions of parameters often make CNNs computationally expensive to train,
requiring extensive time and manual tuning to discover optimal architectures.
In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for boosting CNN performance that
integrates dynamic feature selection with the principles of BoostCNN. Our
approach incorporates two key strategies: subgrid selection and importance
sampling, to guide training toward informative regions of the feature space. We
further develop a family of algorithms that embed boosting weights directly
into the network training process using a least squares loss formulation. This
integration not only alleviates the burden of manual architecture design but
also enhances accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results across several
fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate that our boosted CNN
variants consistently outperform conventional CNNs in both predictive
performance and training speed.

Abstract: Machine and deep learning have grown in popularity and use in biological
research over the last decade but still present challenges in interpretability
of the fitted model. The development and use of metrics to determine features
driving predictions and increase model interpretability continues to be an open
area of research. We investigate the use of Shapley Additive Explanations
(SHAP) on a multi-view deep learning model applied to multi-omics data for the
purposes of identifying biomolecules of interest. Rankings of features via
these attribution methods are compared across various architectures to evaluate
consistency of the method. We perform multiple computational experiments to
assess the robustness of SHAP and investigate modeling approaches and
diagnostics to increase and measure the reliability of the identification of
important features. Accuracy of a random-forest model fit on subsets of
features selected as being most influential as well as clustering quality using
only these features are used as a measure of effectiveness of the attribution
method. Our findings indicate that the rankings of features resulting from SHAP
are sensitive to the choice of architecture as well as different random
initializations of weights, suggesting caution when using attribution methods
on multi-view deep learning models applied to multi-omics data. We present an
alternative, simple method to assess the robustness of identification of
important biomolecules.

Abstract: Many data-science applications involve detecting a shared signal between two
high-dimensional variables. Using random matrix theory methods, we determine
when such signal can be detected and reconstructed from sample correlations,
despite the background of sampling noise induced correlations. We consider
three different covariance matrices constructed from two high-dimensional
variables: their individual self covariance, their cross covariance, and the
self covariance of the concatenated (joint) variable, which incorporates the
self and the cross correlation blocks. We observe the expected Baik, Ben Arous,
and P\'ech\'e detectability phase transition in all these covariance matrices,
and we show that joint and cross covariance matrices always reconstruct the
shared signal earlier than the self covariances. Whether the joint or the cross
approach is better depends on the mismatch of dimensionalities between the
variables. We discuss what these observations mean for choosing the right
method for detecting linear correlations in data and how these findings may
generalize to nonlinear statistical dependencies.

Conclusion: 该模型不仅扩展了Hopfield联想记忆的框架，还为理解无定形固体物理与联想记忆机制之间的联系提供了新视角。

Abstract: We present a vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative memory model
inspired by the theory of amorphous solids, where binary neural states are
replaced by unit vectors $\mathbf{s}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ on the sphere $S^2$.
The generalized Hebbian learning rule creates a block-structured weight matrix
through outer products of stored pattern vectors, analogous to the Hessian
matrix structure in amorphous solids. We demonstrate that this model exhibits
quantifiable structural properties characteristic of disordered materials:
energy landscapes with deep minima for stored patterns versus random
configurations (energy gaps $\sim 7$ units), strongly anisotropic correlations
encoded in the weight matrix (anisotropy ratios $\sim 10^2$), and
order-disorder transitions controlled by the pattern density $\gamma = P/(N
\cdot d)$. The enhanced memory capacity ($\gamma_c \approx 0.55$ for a

and the emergence of orientational correlations establish connections between
associative memory mechanisms and amorphous solid physics, particularly in
systems with continuous orientational degrees of freedom. We also unveil the
scaling with the coordination number $Z$ of the memory capacity: $\gamma_c \sim
(Z-6)$ from the isostatic point $Z_c =6$ of the 3D elastic network, which
closely mirrors the scaling of the shear modulus $G \sim (Z-6)$ in 3D
central-force spring networks.

Motivation: 传统状态空间模型在处理非高斯分布（如偏态和重尾）的异常数据时表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 采用非对称拉普拉斯分布建模，提出高效的变分贝叶斯算法和单循环参数估计策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在各种噪声条件下表现鲁棒，无需手动调参，且计算资源消耗更低。

Conclusion: 该模型在鲁棒控制和金融建模等领域具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: State-space models are pivotal for dynamic system analysis but often struggle
with outlier data that deviates from Gaussian distributions, frequently
exhibiting skewness and heavy tails. This paper introduces a robust extension
utilizing the asymmetric Laplace distribution, specifically tailored to capture
these complex characteristics. We propose an efficient variational Bayes
algorithm and a novel single-loop parameter estimation strategy, significantly
enhancing the efficiency of the filtering, smoothing, and parameter estimation
processes. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our methods provide
consistently robust performance across various noise settings without the need
for manual hyperparameter adjustments. In stark contrast, existing models
generally rely on specific noise conditions and necessitate extensive manual
tuning. Moreover, our approach uses far fewer computational resources, thereby
validating the model's effectiveness and underscoring its potential for
practical applications in fields such as robust control and financial modeling.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonconvex decentralised optimisation and learning
over a network of distributed agents. We develop an ADMM algorithm based on the
Randomised Block Coordinate Douglas-Rachford splitting method which enables
agents in the network to distributedly and asynchronously compute a set of
first-order stationary solutions of the problem. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first decentralised and asynchronous algorithm for solving
nonconvex optimisation problems with convergence proof. The numerical examples
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for distributed Phase

Result: 提出了可验证或否定集合不变性的测试，并构造了所有满足条件的控制器。

Conclusion: 测试结果具有构造性，成功时提供控制器，失败时证明无解，并通过实例验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Given a controlled diffusion and a connected, bounded, Lipschitz set, when is
it possible to guarantee controlled set invariance with probability one? In
this work, we answer this question by deriving the necessary and sufficient
conditions for the same in terms of gradients of certain log-likelihoods --
a.k.a. score vector fields -- for two cases: given finite time horizon and
infinite time horizon. The deduced conditions comprise a score-based test that
provably certifies or falsifies the existence of Markovian controllers for
given controlled set invariance problem data. Our results are constructive in
the sense when the problem data passes the proposed test, we characterize all
controllers guaranteeing the desired set invariance. When the problem data
fails the proposed test, there does not exist a controller that can accomplish
the desired set invariance with probability one. The computation in the
proposed tests involve solving certain Dirichlet boundary value problems, and
in the finite horizon case, can also account for additional constraint of
hitting a target subset at the terminal time. We illustrate the results using
several semi-analytical and numerical examples.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative
model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy.
However, existing FL algorithms predominantly focus on unconstrained
optimization problems with exact gradient information, limiting its
applicability in scenarios where only noisy function evaluations are accessible
or where model parameters are constrained. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel zeroth-order projection-based algorithm on Riemannian manifolds
for FL. By leveraging the projection operator, we introduce a computationally
efficient zeroth-order Riemannian gradient estimator. Unlike existing
estimators, ours requires only a simple Euclidean random perturbation,
eliminating the need to sample random vectors in the tangent space, thus
reducing computational cost. Theoretically, we first prove the approximation
properties of the estimator and then establish the sublinear convergence of the
proposed algorithm, matching the rate of its first-order counterpart.
Numerically, we first assess the efficiency of our estimator using kernel
principal component analysis. Furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to
two real-world scenarios: zeroth-order attacks on deep neural networks and
low-rank neural network training to validate the theoretical findings.

Result: 特征表示偏差可能导致分析结果的严重偏差，影响对系统的全面理解。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在神经科学中考虑特征表示偏差的重要性，并提出了对分析方法改进的需求。

Abstract: A common approach in neuroscience is to study neural representations as a
means to understand a system -- increasingly, by relating the neural
representations to the internal representations learned by computational
models. However, a recent work in machine learning (Lampinen, 2024) shows that
learned feature representations may be biased to over-represent certain
features, and represent others more weakly and less-consistently. For example,
simple (linear) features may be more strongly and more consistently represented
than complex (highly nonlinear) features. These biases could pose challenges
for achieving full understanding of a system through representational analysis.
In this perspective, we illustrate these challenges -- showing how feature
representation biases can lead to strongly biased inferences from common
analyses like PCA, regression, and RSA. We also present homomorphic encryption
as a simple case study of the potential for strong dissociation between
patterns of representation and computation. We discuss the implications of
these results for representational comparisons between systems, and for
neuroscience more generally.

Result: 抑郁和自杀倾向患者表现出更早、更长、更强的解码反应，以及更广泛的神经激活。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了抑郁和自杀倾向患者的神经认知异常，为开发EEG生物标志物提供了依据。

Abstract: Depression and suicidality profoundly impact cognition and emotion, yet
objective neurophysiological biomarkers remain elusive. We investigated the
spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying affective semantic processing in
individuals with varying levels of clinical severity of depression and
suicidality using multivariate decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) data.
Participants (N=137) completed a sentence evaluation task involving emotionally
charged self-referential statements while EEG was recorded. We identified
robust, neural signatures of semantic processing, with peak decoding accuracy
between 300-600 ms -- a window associated with automatic semantic evaluation
and conflict monitoring. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with
depression and suicidality showed earlier onset, longer duration, and greater
amplitude decoding responses, along with broader cross-temporal generalization
and increased activation of frontocentral and parietotemporal components. These
findings suggest altered sensitivity and impaired disengagement from
emotionally salient content in the clinical groups, advancing our understanding
of the neurocognitive basis of mental health and providing a principled basis
for developing reliable EEG-based biomarkers of depression and suicidality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高保真拓扑优化方法计算成本高，需要多次迭代。本文旨在通过代理模型预测准最优拓扑，减少计算负担。

Method: 采用前馈网络学习输入参数与潜在空间之间的映射，预测准最优拓扑，再通过高效算法修正和优化设计。

Result: 平均优化迭代次数减少53%，目标函数最优值差异低于4%，即使在训练和验证域外也表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了计算效率，同时保持了高保真优化的准确性。

Abstract: A surrogate-based topology optimisation algorithm for linear elastic
structures under parametric loads and boundary conditions is proposed. Instead
of learning the parametric solution of the state (and adjoint) problems or the
optimisation trajectory as a function of the iterations, the proposed approach
devises a surrogate version of the entire optimisation pipeline. First, the
method predicts a quasi-optimal topology for a given problem configuration as a
surrogate model of high-fidelity topologies optimised with the homogenisation
method. This is achieved by means of a feed-forward net learning the mapping
between the input parameters characterising the system setup and a latent space
determined by encoder/decoder blocks reducing the dimensionality of the
parametric topology optimisation problem and reconstructing a high-dimensional
representation of the topology. Then, the predicted topology is used as an
educated initial guess for a computationally efficient algorithm penalising the
intermediate values of the design variable, while enforcing the governing
equations of the system. This step allows the method to correct potential
errors introduced by the surrogate model, eliminate artifacts, and refine the
design in order to produce topologies consistent with the underlying physics.
Different architectures are proposed and the approximation and generalisation
capabilities of the resulting models are numerically evaluated. The
quasi-optimal topologies allow to outperform the high-fidelity optimiser by
reducing the average number of optimisation iterations by $53\%$ while
achieving discrepancies below $4\%$ in the optimal value of the objective
functional, even in the challenging scenario of testing the model to
extrapolate beyond the training and validation domain.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线编程学习者常感到孤立和挫败，缺乏指导，而社交媒体上的自我调节实践提供了灵感。

Method: 开发了一个包含网页平台和浏览器扩展的系统，利用AI生成反馈，将学习活动转化为故事。

Result: 15名学习者试用后反馈积极，认为系统支持自我调节，尤其喜欢实时反思和AI反馈。

Conclusion: 系统展示了作为自我调节工具的潜力，未来可进一步优化AI功能。

Abstract: Many people learn programming independently from online resources and often
report struggles in achieving their personal learning goals. Learners
frequently describe their experiences as isolating and frustrating, challenged
by abundant uncertainties, information overload, and distraction, compounded by
limited guidance. At the same time, social media serves as a personal space
where many engage in diverse self-regulation practices, including help-seeking,
using external memory aids (e.g., self-notes), self-reflection, emotion
regulation, and self-motivation. For instance, learners often mark achievements
and set milestones through their posts. In response, we developed a system
consisting of a web platform and browser extensions to support self-regulation
online. The design aims to add learner-defined structure to otherwise
unstructured experiences and bring meaning to curation and reflection
activities by translating them into learning stories with AI-generated
feedback. We position storytelling as an integrative approach to design that
connects resource curation, reflective and sensemaking practice, and narrative
practices learners already use across social platforms. We recruited 15
informal programming learners who are regular social media users to engage with
the system in a self-paced manner; participation concluded upon submitting a
learning story and survey. We used three quantitative scales and a qualitative
survey to examine users' characteristics and perceptions of the system's
support for their self-regulation. User feedback suggests the system's
viability as a self-regulation aid. Learners particularly valued in-situ
reflection, automated story feedback, and video annotation, while other
features received mixed views. We highlight perceived benefits, friction
points, and design opportunities for future AI-augmented self-regulation tools.

Conclusion: VRISE展示了沉浸式数字环境在提升测量教育、扩大参与和强化核心能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Surveying is a core component of civil engineering education, requiring
students to engage in hands-on spatial measurement, instrumentation handling,
and field-based decision-making. However, traditional instruction often poses
logistical and cognitive challenges that can hinder accessibility and student
engagement. While virtual laboratories have gained traction in engineering
education, few are purposefully designed to support flexible, adaptive learning
in surveying. To address this gap, we developed Virtual Reality for Immersive
and Interactive Surveying Education (VRISE), an immersive virtual reality
laboratory that replicates ground-based and aerial surveying tasks through
customizable, accessible, and user-friendly modules. VRISE features interactive
experiences such as differential leveling with a digital level equipment and
waypoint-based drone navigation, enhanced by input smoothing, adaptive
interfaces, and real-time feedback to accommodate diverse learning styles.
Evaluation across multiple user sessions demonstrated consistent gains in
measurement accuracy, task efficiency, and interaction quality, with a clear
progression in skill development across the ground-based and aerial surveying
modalities. By reducing cognitive load and physical demands, even in tasks
requiring fine motor control and spatial reasoning, VRISE demonstrates the
potential of immersive, repeatable digital environments to enhance surveying
education, broaden participation, and strengthen core competencies in a safe
and engaging setting.

Motivation: 现有工具在规模、准确性或可访问性上有限，无法满足对动词框架频率的需求。

Method: 使用LLMs生成包含476个英语动词的句子语料库，并指导LLM像语言学家一样分析句法结构。

Result: 该流程在多个评估数据集上优于两种广泛使用的句法分析器，且资源消耗远低于人工分析。

Conclusion: 该自动化流程为动词框架频率估算提供了快速、可扩展的解决方案，并支持未来研究的扩展。

Abstract: We present an automated pipeline for estimating Verb Frame Frequencies
(VFFs), the frequency with which a verb appears in particular syntactic frames.
VFFs provide a powerful window into syntax in both human and machine language
systems, but existing tools for calculating them are limited in scale,
accuracy, or accessibility. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate a
corpus of sentences containing 476 English verbs. Next, by instructing an LLM
to behave like an expert linguist, we had it analyze the syntactic structure of
the sentences in this corpus. This pipeline outperforms two widely used
syntactic parsers across multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it requires
far fewer resources than manual parsing (the gold-standard), thereby enabling
rapid, scalable VFF estimation. Using the LLM parser, we produce a new VFF
database with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntactic distinctions, and
explicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates
commonly studied in psycholinguistics. The pipeline is easily customizable and
extensible to new verbs, syntactic frames, and even other languages. We present
this work as a proof of concept for automated frame frequency estimation, and
release all code and data to support future research.

Result: 在多轮对话语料库上的实验表明，通过共享BERT输出信息给LLMs，系统性能得到提升。

Conclusion: 混合方法在意图识别和OOS检测任务中表现优异，尤其在数据稀缺场景下具有潜力。

Abstract: Intent recognition is a fundamental component in task-oriented dialogue
systems (TODS). Determining user intents and detecting whether an intent is
Out-of-Scope (OOS) is crucial for TODS to provide reliable responses. However,
traditional TODS require large amount of annotated data. In this work we
propose a hybrid approach to combine BERT and LLMs in zero and few-shot
settings to recognize intents and detect OOS utterances. Our approach leverages
LLMs generalization power and BERT's computational efficiency in such
scenarios. We evaluate our method on multi-party conversation corpora and
observe that sharing information from BERT outputs to LLMs leads to system
performance improvement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative approaches in
several important fields. This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent
writing by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In
this work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework
for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a
patent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a
consistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER
goes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output
quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g.,
BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations,
and applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks.
We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone.
Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and
stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific
baselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and
future research.

Result: 在30种LLM中测试，攻击成功率显著高于现有方法（60.1% vs. 31.6%）。

Conclusion: 多偏见交互是强大攻击向量，为更鲁棒AI系统提供新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to
adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from
rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt
engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked
power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose
CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages
both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that
embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while
maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant
vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models.
CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to
the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations
in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions
as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel
interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety,
paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.

Method: 通过干预18种语言（包括低资源语言）的语言特定神经元，提出语言转向偏移（LSS）评分，评估其在多项下游任务中的效果。

Result: 最优放大因子能有效引导输出至目标语言，但对跨语言任务表现通常有负面影响。

Conclusion: 放大语言特定神经元对低资源语言有益，但对跨语言迁移帮助有限。

Abstract: Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual
languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them.
However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work
investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through
interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three
models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification
factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a
proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on
downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge
(Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors
effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using
this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some
cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight
the effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where
amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but
provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.

Abstract: Recent advancements in financial problem-solving have leveraged LLMs and

However, credit assessment remains an underexplored challenge, traditionally
dependent on rule-based methods and statistical models. In this paper, we
introduce MASCA, an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to enhance credit
evaluation by mirroring real-world decision-making processes. The framework
employs a layered architecture where specialized LLM-based agents
collaboratively tackle sub-tasks. Additionally, we integrate contrastive
learning for risk and reward assessment to optimize decision-making. We further
present a signaling game theory perspective on hierarchical multi-agent
systems, offering theoretical insights into their structure and interactions.
Our paper also includes a detailed bias analysis in credit assessment,
addressing fairness concerns. Experimental results demonstrate that MASCA
outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of hierarchical
LLM-based multi-agent systems in financial applications, particularly in credit
scoring.

Conclusion: 通过新同步准则，解决了自注意力动力学的猜想，并确定了同步的临界范围。

Abstract: This paper considers a mean-field model of $n$ interacting particles whose
state space is the unit circle, a generalization of the classical Kuramoto
model. Global synchronization is said to occur if after starting from almost
any initial state, all particles coalesce to a common point on the circle. We
propose a general synchronization criterion in terms of $L_1$-norm of the third
derivative of the particle interaction function. As an application we resolve a
conjecture for the so-called self-attention dynamics (stylized model of
transformers), by showing synchronization for all $\beta \ge -0.16$, which
significantly extends the previous bound of $0\le \beta \le 1$ from
Criscitiello, Rebjock, McRae, and Boumal (2024). We also show that global
synchronization does not occur when $\beta < -2/3$.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进静态数据结构下界、范围避免和伪随机CSP实例反驳之间的联系，提升现有下界结果。

Method: 采用更简化的XOR反驳方法，处理奇数次情况，并结合多输出常数深度电路的输出分析。

Result: 证明了多输出常数深度电路的输出与高独立性分布的字符串距离较远，并可高效验证。

Conclusion: 该方法为细胞探测下界和NC0电路的范围避免算法提供了新的应用。

Abstract: A recent work (Korten, Pitassi, and Impagliazzo, FOCS 2025) established an
insightful connection between static data structure lower bounds, range
avoidance of $\text{NC}^0$ circuits, and the refutation of pseudorandom CSP
instances, leading to improvements to some longstanding lower bounds in the
cell-probe/bit-probe models. Here, we improve these lower bounds in certain
cases via a more streamlined reduction to XOR refutation, coupled with handling
the odd-arity case. Our result can be viewed as a complete derandomization of
the state-of-the-art semi-random $k$-XOR refutation analysis (Guruswami,
Kothari and Manohar, STOC 2022, Hsieh, Kothari and Mohanty, SODA 2023), which
complements the derandomization of the even-arity case obtained by Korten et
al.
  As our main technical statement, we show that for any multi-output
constant-depth circuit that substantially stretches its input, its output is
very likely far from strings sampled from distributions with sufficient
independence, and further this can be efficiently certified. Via suitable
shifts in perspectives, this gives applications to cell-probe lower bounds and
range avoidance algorithms for $\mathsf{NC}^0$ circuits.

TL;DR: GABRIL利用人类注视数据改进模仿学习，通过正则化损失减少因果混淆，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习常因因果混淆导致性能下降，需解决此问题。

Method: 引入基于注视数据的正则化损失（GABRIL），引导模型关注因果相关特征。

Result: 在Atari和CARLA实验中，GABRIL分别比基线提升179%和76%。

Conclusion: GABRIL不仅提升性能，还增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely adopted approach which enables agents to
learn from human expert demonstrations by framing the task as a supervised
learning problem. However, IL often suffers from causal confusion, where agents
misinterpret spurious correlations as causal relationships, leading to poor
performance in testing environments with distribution shift. To address this
issue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a
novel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data
collection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a
regularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant
features identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects
of confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and
the Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and
applying our method in both domains. Experimental results show that the
improvement of GABRIL over behavior cloning is around 179% more than the same
number for other baselines in the Atari and 76% in the CARLA setup. Finally, we
show that our method provides extra explainability when compared to regular IL
agents.

Abstract: Recent developments in imitation learning have considerably advanced robotic
manipulation. However, current techniques in imitation learning can suffer from
poor generalization, limiting performance even under relatively minor domain
shifts. In this work, we aim to enhance the generalization capabilities of
complex imitation learning algorithms to handle unpredictable changes from the
training environments to deployment environments. To avoid confusion caused by
observations that are not relevant to the target task, we propose to explicitly
learn the causal relationship between observation components and expert
actions, employing a framework similar to [6], where a causal structural
function is learned by intervention on the imitation learning policy.
Disentangling the feature representation from image input as in [6] is hard to
satisfy in complex imitation learning process in robotic manipulation, we
theoretically clarify that this requirement is not necessary in causal
relationship learning. Therefore, we propose a simple causal structure learning
framework that can be easily embedded in recent imitation learning
architectures, such as the Action Chunking Transformer [31]. We demonstrate our
approach using a simulation of the ALOHA [31] bimanual robot arms in Mujoco,
and show that the method can considerably mitigate the generalization problem
of existing complex imitation learning algorithms.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用归一化流（NF）估计自动驾驶系统（ADS）场景参数的PDF，以改进风险量化，并与传统核密度估计（KDE）对比，显示NF在高维数据中更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为安全验证自动驾驶系统（ADS），需准确估计场景参数的PDF，传统方法存在假设限制或维度灾难问题。

Method: 采用归一化流（NF）进行PDF估计，通过可逆映射从简单分布生成复杂分布，避免对PDF形状的严格假设。

Result: NF在高维数据中表现优于KDE，能更精确量化风险及不确定性，但计算资源需求更高。

Conclusion: NF在场景安全验证中潜力显著，未来可优化其架构与训练以增强适用性。

Abstract: The development of safety validation methods is essential for the safe
deployment and operation of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). One of the goals
of safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing
with real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,
where test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a
quantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios
must be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is
expressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions
about the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while
avoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited
parameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.
  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF
of the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple
base distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and
differentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation
without restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,
comparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional
method for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational
resources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.
As a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more
precise assessment of an ADS's safety.
  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future
work involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and
optimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training
hyperparameters to further enhance their applicability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可编程数据平面（如支持P4语言的交换机）的出现改变了网络安全，支持定制化、线速数据包处理，但其硬件限制（如有限内存和指令集）需要创新技术来克服。

Method: 通过技术如“recirculate-and-truncate”和查找表预计算，绕过硬件限制，实现复杂的安全功能（如DDoS检测、防火墙策略执行等）。

Result: 展示了可编程交换机在网络安全中的多样化应用，并总结了非直观的设计技术。

Conclusion: 尽管硬件限制存在，可编程交换机仍能实现复杂安全功能，但仍有未解决问题和新兴研究方向。

Abstract: The emergence of programmable data planes, and particularly switches
supporting the P4 language, has transformed network security by enabling
customized, line-rate packet processing. These switches, originally intended
for flexible forwarding, now play a broader role: detecting and mitigating
attacks such as DDoS and spoofing, enforcing next-generation firewall policies,
and even supporting in-network cryptography and machine learning. These
capabilities are made possible by techniques such as recirculate-and-truncate
and lookup-table precomputation, which work around architectural constraints
like limited memory and restricted instruction sets. In this paper, we
systematize recent advances in security applications built on programmable
switches, with an emphasis on the capabilities, challenges, and architectural
workarounds. We highlight the non-obvious design techniques that make complex
in-network security functions feasible despite the constraints of the hardware
platform, and also comment on remaining issues and emerging research
directions.

Conclusion: SAEL通过结合LLM的解释能力和自适应架构，显著提升了智能合约漏洞检测的性能。

Abstract: With the increasing security issues in blockchain, smart contract
vulnerability detection has become a research focus. Existing vulnerability
detection methods have their limitations: 1) Static analysis methods struggle
with complex scenarios. 2) Methods based on specialized pre-trained models
perform well on specific datasets but have limited generalization capabilities.
In contrast, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate
impressive ability in adapting to new vulnerability patterns. However, they
often underperform on specific vulnerability types compared to methods based on
specialized pre-trained models. We also observe that explanations generated by
general-purpose LLMs can provide fine-grained code understanding information,
contributing to improved detection performance.
  Inspired by these observations, we propose SAEL, an LLM-based framework for
smart contract vulnerability detection. We first design targeted prompts to
guide LLMs in identifying vulnerabilities and generating explanations, which
serve as prediction features. Next, we apply prompt-tuning on CodeT5 and T5 to
process contract code and explanations, enhancing task-specific performance. To
combine the strengths of each approach, we introduce an Adaptive
Mixture-of-Experts architecture. This dynamically adjusts feature weights via a
Gating Network, which selects relevant features using TopK filtering and
Softmax normalization, and incorporates a Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism
to enhance cross-feature relationships. This design enables effective
integration of LLM predictions, explanation features, and code features through
gradient optimization. The loss function jointly considers both independent
feature performance and overall weighted predictions. Experiments show that
SAEL outperforms existing methods across various vulnerabilities.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了Android系统更新导致的权限废弃或限制，可能引发概念漂移，影响检测效果。

Method: 使用包含166个权限的大数据集，应用多种机器学习和深度学习算法，结合概念漂移检测策略。

Result: 废弃和受限权限对模型性能影响较小，某些算法（如CNN）准确性提升；数据集平衡进一步优化性能。

Conclusion: Android权限是有效的恶意软件检测特征，排除废弃和受限权限有助于概念漂移检测。

Abstract: Permission analysis is a widely used method for Android malware detection. It
involves examining the permissions requested by an application to access
sensitive data or perform potentially malicious actions. In recent years,
various machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to Android malware
detection using permission-based features and feature selection techniques,
often achieving high accuracy. However, these studies have largely overlooked
important factors such as protection levels and the deprecation or restriction
of permissions due to updates in the Android OS -- factors that can contribute
to concept drift.
  In this study, we investigate the impact of deprecated and restricted
permissions on the performance of machine learning models. A large dataset
containing 166 permissions was used, encompassing more than 70,000 malware and
benign applications. Various machine learning and deep learning algorithms were
employed as classifiers, along with different concept drift detection
strategies. The results suggest that Android permissions are highly effective
features for malware detection, with the exclusion of deprecated and restricted
permissions having only a marginal impact on model performance. In some cases,
such as with CNN, accuracy improved. Excluding these permissions also enhanced
the detection of concept drift using a year-to-year analysis strategy. Dataset
balancing further improved model performance, reduced low-accuracy instances,
and enhanced concept drift detection via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

Motivation: 恶意JavaScript代码对用户隐私和系统安全构成威胁，但现有方法因代码混淆和JavaScript语言特性难以有效检测。

Method: DeCoda通过LLM多阶段去混淆生成AST表示，并利用聚类图学习捕获节点和全局结构关系。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上F1-score分别达到94.64%和97.71%，优于现有方法10.74%和13.85%。

Conclusion: LLM去混淆和聚类级关系建模在恶意代码检测中效果显著。

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of web-based applications and cloud services,
malicious JavaScript code continues to pose significant threats to user
privacy, system integrity, and enterprise security. But, detecting such threats
remains challenging due to sophisticated code obfuscation techniques and
JavaScript's inherent language characteristics, particularly its nested closure
structures and syntactic flexibility. In this work, we propose DeCoda, a hybrid
defense framework that combines large language model (LLM)-based deobfuscation
with code graph learning: (1) We first construct a sophisticated
prompt-learning pipeline with multi-stage refinement, where the LLM
progressively reconstructs the original code structure from obfuscated inputs
and then generates normalized Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representations; (2)
In JavaScript ASTs, dynamic typing scatters semantically similar nodes while
deeply nested functions fracture scope capturing, introducing structural noise
and semantic ambiguity. To address these challenges, we then propose to learn
hierarchical code graph representations via a Cluster-wise Graph that
synergistically integrates graph transformer network, node clustering, and
node-to-cluster attention to simultaneously capture both local node-level
semantics and global cluster-induced structural relationships from AST graph.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves F1-scores of 94.64%
and 97.71% on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating absolute improvements of
10.74% and 13.85% over state-of-the-art baselines. In false-positive control
evaluation at fixed FPR levels (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01), our approach delivers
4.82, 5.91, and 2.53 higher TPR respectively compared to the best-performing
baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-based deobfuscation
and underscore the importance of modeling cluster-level relationships in
detecting malicious code.

Abstract: Despite outstanding results, machine learning-based Android malware detection
models struggle with concept drift, where rapidly evolving malware
characteristics degrade model effectiveness. This study examines the impact of
concept drift on Android malware detection, evaluating two datasets and nine
machine learning and deep learning algorithms, as well as Large Language Models
(LLMs). Various feature types--static, dynamic, hybrid, semantic, and
image-based--were considered. The results showed that concept drift is
widespread and significantly affects model performance. Factors influencing the
drift include feature types, data environments, and detection methods.
Balancing algorithms helped with class imbalance but did not fully address
concept drift, which primarily stems from the dynamic nature of the malware
landscape. No strong link was found between the type of algorithm used and
concept drift, the impact was relatively minor compared to other variables
since hyperparameters were not fine-tuned, and the default algorithm
configurations were used. While LLMs using few-shot learning demonstrated
promising detection performance, they did not fully mitigate concept drift,
highlighting the need for further investigation.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) offers a promising framework for
developing control strategies in chemical process systems using historical
data, without the risks or costs of online experimentation. This work
investigates the application of offline RL to the safe and efficient control of
an exothermic polymerisation continuous stirred-tank reactor. We introduce a
Gymnasium-compatible simulation environment that captures the reactor's
nonlinear dynamics, including reaction kinetics, energy balances, and
operational constraints. The environment supports three industrially relevant
scenarios: startup, grade change down, and grade change up. It also includes
reproducible offline datasets generated from proportional-integral controllers
with randomised tunings, providing a benchmark for evaluating offline RL
algorithms in realistic process control tasks.
  We assess behaviour cloning and implicit Q-learning as baseline algorithms,
highlighting the challenges offline agents face, including steady-state offsets
and degraded performance near setpoints. To address these issues, we propose a
novel deployment-time safety layer that performs gradient-based action
correction using input convex neural networks (PICNNs) as learned cost models.
The PICNN enables real-time, differentiable correction of policy actions by
descending a convex, state-conditioned cost surface, without requiring
retraining or environment interaction.
  Experimental results show that offline RL, particularly when combined with
convex action correction, can outperform traditional control approaches and
maintain stability across all scenarios. These findings demonstrate the
feasibility of integrating offline RL with interpretable and safety-aware
corrections for high-stakes chemical process control, and lay the groundwork
for more reliable data-driven automation in industrial systems.

Abstract: As neural networks (NNs) become increasingly prevalent in safety-critical
neural network-controlled cyber-physical systems (NNCSs), formally guaranteeing
their safety becomes crucial. For these systems, safety must be ensured
throughout their entire operation, necessitating infinite-time horizon
verification. To verify the infinite-time horizon safety of NNCSs, recent
approaches leverage Differential Dynamic Logic (dL). However, these dL-based
guarantees rely on idealized, real-valued NN semantics and fail to account for
roundoff errors introduced by finite-precision implementations. This paper
bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world implementations
by incorporating robustness under finite-precision perturbations -- in sensing,
actuation, and computation -- into the safety verification. We model the
problem as a hybrid game between a good Demon, responsible for control actions,
and a bad Angel, introducing perturbations. This formulation enables formal
proofs of robustness w.r.t. a given (bounded) perturbation. Leveraging this
bound, we employ state-of-the-art mixed-precision fixed-point tuners to
synthesize sound and efficient implementations, thus providing a complete
end-to-end solution. We evaluate our approach on case studies from the
automotive and aeronautics domains, producing efficient NN implementations with
rigorous infinite-time horizon safety guarantees.

Abstract: Dental crowns are essential dental treatments for restoring damaged or
missing teeth of patients. Recent design approaches of dental crowns are
carried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a
preparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually
define a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a
non-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework
to determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A
dataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to
train a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was
modified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth
into two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary
faces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to
train 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their
results to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and
optimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation
results. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to
represent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the
centers of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that
an ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest
number of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance
threshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground
truth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the
preparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth
margin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683). We provide
the train and test datasets for the community.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals offer a promising avenue for
developing innovative human-computer interfaces by providing insights into
muscular activity. However, the limited volume of training data and
computational constraints during deployment have restricted the investigation
of scaling up the model size for solving sEMG tasks. In this paper, we
demonstrate that vanilla transformer models can be effectively scaled up on
sEMG data and yield improved cross-user performance up to 110M parameters,
surpassing the model size regime investigated in other sEMG research (usually
<10M parameters). We show that >100M-parameter models can be effectively
distilled into models 50x smaller with minimal loss of performance (<1.5%
absolute). This results in efficient and expressive models suitable for complex
real-time sEMG tasks in real-world environments.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling buyer intent is a foundational challenge in
optimizing search query reformulation within the dynamic landscape of
e-commerce search systems. This work introduces a robust data pipeline designed
to mine and analyze large-scale buyer query logs, with a focus on extracting
fine-grained intent signals from both explicit interactions and implicit
behavioral cues. Leveraging advanced sequence mining techniques and supervised
learning models, the pipeline systematically captures patterns indicative of
latent purchase intent, enabling the construction of a high-fidelity,
intent-rich dataset. The proposed framework facilitates the development of
adaptive query rewrite strategies by grounding reformulations in inferred user
intent rather than surface-level lexical signals. This alignment between query
rewriting and underlying user objectives enhances both retrieval relevance and
downstream engagement metrics. Empirical evaluations across multiple product
verticals demonstrate measurable gains in precision-oriented relevance metrics,
underscoring the efficacy of intent-aware reformulation. Our findings highlight
the value of intent-centric modeling in bridging the gap between sparse user
inputs and complex product discovery goals, and establish a scalable foundation
for future research in user-aligned neural retrieval and ranking systems.

TL;DR: trAIce3D是一种深度学习架构，用于精确分割微胶质细胞，采用两阶段方法，显著提升分割精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细胞形状包含其功能的关键信息，但现有分割方法在微胶质细胞（与神经退行性疾病相关的免疫细胞）上表现不佳，限制了临床研究。

Method: trAIce3D采用两阶段方法：第一阶段用3D U-Net和视觉变换器检测细胞体；第二阶段通过交叉注意力块细化细胞体和分支。训练分为自监督的细胞体分割和基于提示的分支分割。

Result: 在41,230个微胶质细胞数据集上，trAIce3D显著提升了分割精度和泛化能力。

Conclusion: trAIce3D不仅适用于微胶质细胞，还可扩展到其他复杂细胞类型，对神经生物学研究有广泛影响。

Abstract: The shape of a cell contains essential information about its function within
the biological system. Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D
microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for
microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases.
Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with
overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter
tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We
introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia
segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage
approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects
somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the
same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections,
refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a
3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases:
self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch
Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and
evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly
improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis
of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its
architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and
astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.

*Xianxuan Long,Yao Fu,Runchao Li,Mu Sheng,Haotian Yu,Xiaotian Han,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在欺骗性指令下内部表征的变化，发现欺骗性指令会显著改变模型的表征，且这些变化集中在早期到中期层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解欺骗性指令如何改变LLM的内部表征，以解决模型安全挑战。

Method: 通过线性探测和稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分析Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemma-2-9B-Instruct在事实验证任务中的内部表征。

Result: 欺骗性指令导致表征显著变化，且这些变化集中在早期到中期层；还识别了对欺骗性指令高度敏感的特定SAE特征。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了欺骗性指令的特征和层级特征，为LLM的检测和控制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to follow maliciously crafted instructions
to generate deceptive responses, posing safety challenges. How deceptive
instructions alter the internal representations of LLM compared to truthful
ones remains poorly understood beyond output analysis. To bridge this gap, we
investigate when and how these representations ``flip'', such as from truthful
to deceptive, under deceptive versus truthful/neutral instructions. Analyzing
the internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct
on a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False
output is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the
internal representation. Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show
that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts
compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated
in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also
identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and
use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive
representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and
feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM
detection and control. Our findings expose feature- and layer-level signatures
of deception, offering new insights for detecting and mitigating instructed
dishonesty in LLMs.

Result: 在模拟足球环境中表现优于基准算法，协作行为更优。

Conclusion: TAAC在多智能体协作任务中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces Team-Attention-Actor-Critic (TAAC), a reinforcement
learning algorithm designed to enhance multi-agent collaboration in cooperative
environments. TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme
incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic.
This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to
explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth
of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We
further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet
complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer
environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent
paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent
Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and
enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal
differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial
distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession
swaps).

TL;DR: 本文首次大规模实证研究物理引擎（PE）中的物理故障，提出分类法、评估检测方法并提供开发者见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理故障影响软件可靠性和用户体验，现有测试方法不足，需改进。

Method: 研究物理故障表现、检测技术效果及开发者对检测实践的看法。

Result: 提出物理故障分类法，评估多种检测方法（如深度学习和多模态模型），并发布PhysiXFails等资源。

Conclusion: 研究为改进物理故障检测提供基础，并发布资源支持未来研究。

Abstract: Physics Engines (PEs) are fundamental software frameworks that simulate
physical interactions in applications ranging from entertainment to
safety-critical systems. Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics
failures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise
software reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical
failures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches
for PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and
focusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures.
This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing
physics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions
addressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of
detection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices.
Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations;
(2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning,
prompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable
insights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches. To
support future research, we release PhysiXFails, code, and other materials at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于HOG-CNN的自动临床决策支持框架，用于视网膜疾病的早期检测，结合手工HOG特征和深度CNN特征，在多个公开数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视网膜疾病诊断依赖人工，耗时耗力，需自动化且可解释的解决方案。

Method: 结合HOG手工特征和CNN深度特征，构建HOG-CNN混合模型。

Result: 在APTOS、ORIGA和IC-AMD数据集上表现优异，如APTOS上98.5%准确率和99.2 AUC。

Conclusion: HOG-CNN是轻量且可解释的模型，适合资源有限的临床环境，为自动化视网膜筛查提供有力工具。

Abstract: The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and
diagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows,
however, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and
resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and
interpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature
extraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration
of handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our
model to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features
from retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark
datasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for
Glaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates
consistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for
binary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the
IC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\% accuracy, 94.8\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,
outperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA,
our model achieves 83.9\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive
performance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive
appendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features.
The model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it particularly suitable
for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results
position HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease
screening.

and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global
scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to

Motivation: 理解个体、群体和事件层面的情绪及上下文信息对分析多人社交情境至关重要。

Method: 采用多模态Swin-Transformer和S3Attention架构，处理输入场景、群体成员和上下文信息，生成联合预测。

Result: 在VGAF-GEMS基准测试中，GEMS框架在定量和定性比较中表现出色。

Conclusion: GEMS框架为未来研究提供了新方向，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with
contextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social
situation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of
predicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event
level emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer
and S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group
members, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing
multi-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions
primarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,
we extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic
analysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims
to predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and
arousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our
benchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses
holistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted
state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on
VGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further
research. The code and data is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MAE在掩码策略依赖性和分布外数据性能下降的问题。

Method: 引入掩码隐式神经表示（MINR）框架，学习图像的连续函数表示。

Result: MINR在域内和域外场景均优于MAE，同时降低模型复杂度。

Conclusion: MINR是现有框架的鲁棒高效替代方案，适用于多种自监督学习应用。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown
significant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in
image reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is
often strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can
degrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations,
we introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that
synergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR
learns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and
generalizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain
scenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model
complexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning
applications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to
existing frameworks.

Motivation: 深度伪造技术（如GAN或扩散模型）对数字媒体和身份验证构成威胁，现有检测方法仅依赖图像域分类器，缺乏辅助任务增强鲁棒性。

Method: 利用VLM的零样本能力进行图像分类，并在高质量深度伪造数据集（60,000张图像）上评估性能。

Result: 零样本模型表现优于现有方法，InstructBLIP架构在DFDC-P数据集上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: VLM在深度伪造检测中优于传统分类器，尤其在零样本和微调场景下。

Abstract: The contemporary phenomenon of deepfakes, utilizing GAN or diffusion models
for face swapping, presents a substantial and evolving threat in digital media,
identity verification, and a multitude of other systems. The majority of
existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized
classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing
only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could
enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of
Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image
classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we
utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which
our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing
methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing
architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against
traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our
results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.

Conclusion: 提示演化机制有效提升了持续学习的性能和多样性。

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning
small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the
complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific
knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either
fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged
during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared
space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To
address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively
aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt
while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both
previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves
accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a
learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to
activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image
classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental
learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods
across all scenarios.

Method: 创建异构集成模型COOkeD，结合封闭世界分类器、零样本CLIP分类器和线性探针分类器的预测结果。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet等基准测试中，COOkeD实现了最先进的OOD检测性能和更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: COOkeD通过简单的异构集成方法显著提升了OOD检测性能，且具有模块化和后处理优势。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in
trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at
test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,
leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised
setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot
setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching
challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by
the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we
show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD
detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD
combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a
specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier
trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is
modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus
introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.
We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also
consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label
noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been
previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art
performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based
OOD detection methods. Code is available at https://github.com/glhr/COOkeD

Result: LCS在五项指标上优于AMD的EASF和FSR1，尤其在感知质量上表现更佳。

Conclusion: LCS展示了ESR模型在资源受限设备上的潜力，为GPU工作负载卸载提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a
problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an
AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient
super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a
low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on
GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize
adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important
details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce
model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS
alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling
Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different
metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality,
demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained
devices.
