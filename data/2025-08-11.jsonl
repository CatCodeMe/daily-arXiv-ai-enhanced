However, as qualitative and static representations, CLDs are limited\nin their ability to support dynamic analysis and inform intervention\nstrategies. Additionally, quantitative CLD analysis methods like network\ncentrality analysis often lead to false inference. We propose\nDiagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D), a method for converting CLDs into exploratory\nsystem dynamics models (SDMs) in the absence of empirical data. With minimal\nuser input - following a protocol to label variables as stocks,\nflows/auxiliaries, or constants - D2D leverages the structural information\nalready encoded in CLDs, namely, link existence and polarity, to simulate\nhypothetical interventions and explore potential leverage points under\nuncertainty. Results suggest that D2D helps distinguish between high- and\nlow-ranked leverage points. We compare D2D to a data-driven SDM constructed\nfrom the same CLD and variable labeling. D2D showed greater consistency with\nthe data-driven model than network centrality analysis, while providing\nuncertainty estimates and guidance for future data collection. The method is\nimplemented in an open-source Python package and a web-based application to\nsupport further testing and lower the barrier to dynamic modeling for\nresearchers working with CLDs. We expect additional validation will further\nestablish the approach's utility across a broad range of cases and domains."}

Omnitrees\nallow to refine only the locally most important dimensions, providing tree\nstructures that are less deep than bintrees and less wide than octrees. As a\nresult, the convergence of the AMR schemes can be increased by up to a factor\nof the dimensionality d for very anisotropic problems, quickly offsetting their\nmodest increase in storage overhead. We validate this finding on the problem of\nbinary shape representation across 4,166 three-dimensional objects: Omnitrees\nincrease the mean convergence rate by 1.5x, require less storage to achieve\nequivalent error bounds, and maximize the information density of the stored\nfunction faster than octrees. These advantages are projected to be even\nstronger for higher-dimensional problems. We provide a first validation by\nintroducing a time-dependent rotation to create four-dimensional\nrepresentations, and discuss the properties of their 4-d octree and omnitree\napproximations. Overall, omnitree discretizations can make existing AMR\napproaches more efficient, and open up new possibilities for high-dimensional\napplications."}

In this study, we propose a novel\nstepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the prediction of\nneurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage of\ntime-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase).\nNotably, our model finds patients for whom this second phase (time-varying\nhemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and also when this\ninformation is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data for a patient\nover time, how important these data are for prognostication varies). Our\napproach extends the standard Fine and Gray model to explicitly model the two\nphases and to incorporate neural networks to flexibly capture complex nonlinear\nfeature relationships. Evaluated on a retrospective cohort of 2,278 comatose\npost-arrest patients, our model demonstrates robust discriminative performance\nfor the competing outcomes of awakening, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy,\nand death despite maximal support. Our approach generalizes to more than two\nphases in which new features are collected and could be used in other dynamic\nprediction tasks, where it may be helpful to know when and for whom newly\ncollected features significantly improve prediction."}

Similar to SNNs,\ndeep state-space models (SSMs) utilize stateful building blocks. However, deep\nSSMs, which recently achieved competitive performance in various temporal\nmodeling tasks, are typically designed with high-precision activation functions\nand no reset mechanisms. To bridge the gains offered by SNNs and the recent\ndeep SSM models, we propose a novel multiple-output spiking neuron model that\ncombines a linear, general SSM state transition with a non-linear feedback\nmechanism through reset. Compared to the existing neuron models for SNNs, our\nproposed model clearly conceptualizes the differences between the spiking\nfunction, the reset condition and the reset action.

In LLM serving, the\nprefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the\ninitial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of\noutput tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the\nKV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to\nschedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that\nthis problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement\nconstraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We\nthen analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as\nFirst-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their\ncompetitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant\ndrawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large.

A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which\nprunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.\nHowever, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,\napplying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and\nstatistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal\ntrade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful\nones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \\textbf{TADrop}\n(\\textbf{T}ensor-wise \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{Drop}), an adaptive\nsparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global\nratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based\non its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with\ndenser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,\nmore critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we\nvalidate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging\nmethods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and\nmultimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and\nsignificantly boosts their performance.

Even worse, if multiple signal features\nare in strong correlation with a noise feature, while being only modestly\ncorrelated with one another, this can result in a noise feature having a\ndistinctly larger FI score than any signal feature.

Land Surface\nTemperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from\nremote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between\nspatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer\npromising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m\nresolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative\nNetwork for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra\nMODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning\nframework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative\nadversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature\nextraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage\nemploys a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from\nthe inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,\nnormalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the\nfused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to\nsuppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy\nbased on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN\ndiscriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods\nin both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the\nbest-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves\nSSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and\neffectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33\nground-based sensors.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposal across a range of inverse problems that include image denoising,\ndeblurring, compressed-sensing magnetic-resonance imaging, and computed\ntomography. The proposed approach outperforms comparable univariate models and\nachieves performance close to that of deep-learning-based regularizers while\nbeing significantly faster, requiring fewer parameters, and being trained on\nsubstantially fewer data. In addition, our model retains a relatively high\nlevel of interpretability due to its structured design."}
