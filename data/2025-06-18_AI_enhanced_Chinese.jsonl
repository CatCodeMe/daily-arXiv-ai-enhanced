However, progress is hindered by two\nkey challenges: the rigidity of conventional evaluation metrics such as\nexecution accuracy, which offer coarse, binary feedback, and the scarcity of\ndomain-specific evaluation datasets. This paper addresses these gaps. To enable\nmore nuanced assessment, we introduce a novel F1-score-based 'soft' metric that\nquantifies the informational overlap between generated and ground-truth SQL\nresults. To address data scarcity, we propose an LLM-driven pipeline that\nsynthesizes realistic question-SQL pairs from database schemas. We demonstrate\nour contributions through an empirical evaluation on an authentic MRO database.\nOur experiments show that the proposed soft metric provides more insightful\nperformance analysis than strict accuracy, and our data generation technique is\neffective in creating a domain-specific benchmark.

Modern backscatter systems are no longer simple reflectors of continuous\nwaves but are increasingly designed to interact with complex, data-carrying\nambient signals from ubiquitous sources like WiFi, ZigBee, and cellular\nnetworks. This review systematically charts the journey of ambient backscatter,\nparticularly focusing on its interaction with ZigBee and other commodity\nwireless protocols over the last decade. We analyze the progression from\nfoundational proof-of-concept systems that established productive backscatter\nto modern high-throughput, concurrent, and cross-technology communication\narchitectures.

Although ReuseViT\nsignificantly reduces computation, these savings do not directly translate into\nperformance gains on GPUs.

Since traditional methods heavily rely on feature\nextraction and large scale labeled data, some recent pre-trained models manage\nto reduce the dependency by utilizing different pre-training tasks to train\ngeneric representations for network packets. However, existing pre-trained\nmodels typically adopt pre-training tasks developed for image or text data,\nwhich are not tailored to traffic data.

Traditional approaches use\npriority dispatching rules based on simple heuristics. Recent work has\nattempted to replace these with deep learning models, particularly graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs), that learn to assign priorities from data. However, training\nsuch models requires customizing numerous factors: graph representation, node\nfeatures, action space, and reward functions. The lack of modular libraries for\nexperimentation makes this research time-consuming. This work introduces\nJobShopLib, a modular library that allows customizing these factors and\ncreating new components with its reinforcement learning environment. We trained\nseveral dispatchers through imitation learning to demonstrate the environment's\nutility.

Several baseline models, including SVMReg,\nBDTree, LSBoost, NN, LSTM, and ERMBag, were evaluated for comparison with our\nEBMBag+ algorithm.

Addressing these gaps, this\npaper extends our prior work on the Dynamic Management of Resources (DMR)\nframework, which provides a modular and user-friendly approach to dynamic\nresource allocation. Building upon the original DMRlib reconfiguration runtime,\nthis work integrates new methodology from the Malleability Module (MaM) of the\nProteo framework, further enhancing reconfiguration capabilities with new\nspawning strategies and data redistribution methods. In this paper, we explore\nnew malleability strategies in HPC dynamic workloads, such as merging MPI\ncommunicators and asynchronous reconfigurations, which offer new opportunities\nfor dramatically reducing memory overhead. The proposed enhancements are\nrigorously evaluated on a world-class supercomputer, demonstrating improved\nresource utilization and workload efficiency. Results show that dynamic\nresource management can reduce the workload completion time by 40% and increase\nthe resource utilization by over 20%, compared to static resource allocation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\uff08DMR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Proteo\u6846\u67b6\u7684Malleability Module\uff08MaM\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08HPC\uff09\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u6613\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eDMRlib\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u6574\u5408Proteo\u6846\u67b6\u7684MaM\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22MPI\u901a\u4fe1\u5408\u5e76\u548c\u5f02\u6b65\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u7b49\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u53ef\u5c06\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1140%\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u63d0\u9ad820%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u5728\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002"}}

This study provides a rigorous\nevaluation of consensus power inequality across five prominent blockchain\nnetworks - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Hedera, and Algorand - using data\ncollected from January 2022 to July 2024. Leveraging established economic\nmetrics, including the Gini coefficient and Theil index, the research\nquantitatively assesses how power is distributed among blockchain network\nparticipants. A robust dataset, capturing network-specific characteristics such\nas mining pools, staking patterns, and consensus nodes, forms the foundation of\nthe analysis, enabling meaningful comparisons across diverse architectures.\nThrough an in-depth comparative study, the paper identifies key disparities in\nconsensus power distribution. Hedera and Bitcoin demonstrate more balanced\npower distribution, aligning closely with the principles of decentralisation.\nEthereum and Cardano demonstrate moderate levels of inequality. However,\ncontrary to expectations, Ethereum has become more concentrated following its\ntransition to Proof-of-Stake. Meanwhile, Algorand shows a pronounced\ncentralisation of power. Moreover, the findings highlight the structural and\noperational drivers of inequality, including economic barriers, governance\nmodels, and network effects, offering actionable insights for more equitable\nnetwork design. This study establishes a methodological framework for\nevaluating blockchain consensus power inequality, emphasising the importance of\ntargeted strategies to ensure fairer power distribution and enhancing the\nsustainability of decentralised systems.

We use coherent integration, a\ntechnique in which data is transformed so that the power of drifting signals is\nconfined to a single discrete Fourier transform (DFT) bin. We perform this\ncoherent search over 123 000 Doppler drift rates in the range ($\\pm$100 Hz\ns$^{-1}$). Second, we search for a variety of signal types, such as pulsed\nsignals and arbitrary repeated waveforms. The analysis uses a range of DFT\nsizes, with frequency resolutions ranging from 0.075 Hz to 1221 Hz.

We accumulated $\\sim 1.2\\times 10^{10}$ such detections.\nThe back end of SETI@home takes these detections, identifies and removes radio\nfrequency interference (RFI), and looks for groups of detections that are\nconsistent with extraterrestrial origin and that persist over long timescales.\nThis paper describes the front end of SETI@home and provides parameters for the\nprimary data source, the Arecibo Observatory; the back end and its results are\ndescribed in a companion paper.", "AI": {"tldr": "SETI@home\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u5fd7\u613f\u8005\u5bb6\u5ead\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5206\u6790\u5c04\u7535\u6570\u636e\u7684SETI\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u9ad8\u641c\u7d22\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5e72\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u6f02\u79fb\u7387\u641c\u7d22\u591a\u79cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSETI\u9879\u76ee\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0cSETI@home\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5229\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u5bb6\u5ead\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u5916\u661f\u6280\u672f\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u65f6\u57df\u6570\u636e\u5206\u53d1\u5230\u8d85\u8fc710^5\u53f0\u5fd7\u613f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u5e72\u79ef\u5206\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u641c\u7d22123,000\u79cd\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u6f02\u79fb\u7387\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684DFT\u3002", "result": "\u524d\u7aef\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u8fc71.2\u00d710^10\u4e2a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540e\u7aef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7b5b\u9009\u53bb\u9664\u5c04\u9891\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5916\u661f\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "SETI@home\u7684\u524d\u7aef\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540e\u7aef\u7ed3\u679c\u5c06\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u8be6\u7ec6\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002"}}

However, these predicted fragments already contain\nbugs. Thus, the current bug prediction approaches support fixing rather than\nprevention. The aim of this paper is to introduce and evaluate Ticket-Level\nPrediction (TLP), an approach to identify tickets that will introduce bugs once\nimplemented. We analyze TLP at three temporal points, each point represents a\nticket lifecycle stage: Open, In Progress, or Closed. We conjecture that: (1)\nTLP accuracy increases as tickets progress towards the closed stage due to\nimproved feature reliability over time, and (2) the predictive power of\nfeatures changes across these temporal points. Our TLP approach leverages 72\nfeatures belonging to six different families: code, developer, external\ntemperature, internal temperature, intrinsic, ticket to tickets, and JIT. Our\nTLP evaluation uses a sliding-window approach, balancing feature selection and\nthree machine-learning bug prediction classifiers on about 10,000 tickets of\ntwo Apache open-source projects. Our results show that TLP accuracy increases\nwith proximity, confirming the expected trade-off between early prediction and\naccuracy. Regarding the prediction power of feature families, no single feature\nfamily dominates across stages; developer-centric signals are most informative\nearly, whereas code and JIT metrics prevail near closure, and temperature-based\nfeatures provide complementary value throughout.

In this work, we\npresent a novel methodology for refactoring Qiskit code using large language\nmodels (LLMs). We begin by extracting a taxonomy of migration scenarios from\nthe different sources of official Qiskit documentation (such as release notes),\ncapturing common patterns such as migration of functionality to different\nmodules and deprecated usage. This taxonomy, along with the original Python\nsource code, is provided as input to an LLM, which is then tasked with\nidentifying instances of migration scenarios in the code and suggesting\nappropriate refactoring solutions. Our approach is designed to address the\ncontext length limitations of current LLMs by structuring the input and\nreasoning process in a targeted, efficient manner. The results demonstrate that\nLLMs, when guided by domain-specific migration knowledge, can effectively\nassist in automating Qiskit code migration.

However, software engineering is more than coding and is\nconcerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In\nthis context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs\nas reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent\nthe same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this\nquestion by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike\nexisting work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such\nas testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which\ncan orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the\npromise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an\nincomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others.\nWe envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which\ncan be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and\nhumans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software\nEngineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding,\ntesting, and patching.

While conventional approaches, such as cost-sensitive\nlearning, oversampling, and graph neural networks, provide partial solutions,\nthey suffer from drawbacks like overfitting, label noise, and poor\ngeneralization in low-density regions. To address these challenges, we propose\nQCL-MixNet, a novel Quantum-Informed Contrastive Learning framework augmented\nwith k-nearest neighbor (kNN) guided dynamic mixup for robust classification\nunder imbalance. QCL-MixNet integrates three core innovations: (i) a Quantum\nEntanglement-inspired layer that models complex feature interactions through\nsinusoidal transformations and gated attention, (ii) a sample-aware mixup\nstrategy that adaptively interpolates feature representations of semantically\nsimilar instances to enhance minority class representation, and (iii) a hybrid\nloss function that unifies focal reweighting, supervised contrastive learning,\ntriplet margin loss, and variance regularization to improve both intra-class\ncompactness and inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on 18\nreal-world imbalanced datasets (binary and multi-class) demonstrate that\nQCL-MixNet consistently outperforms 20 state-of-the-art machine learning, deep\nlearning, and GNN-based baselines in macro-F1 and recall, often by substantial\nmargins.

We discover that\nunlearning leaves behind persistent ''fingerprints'' in LLMs, detectable traces\nin both model behavior and internal representations. These traces can be\nidentified from output responses, even when prompted with forget-irrelevant\ninputs. Specifically, a simple supervised classifier can reliably determine\nwhether a model has undergone unlearning based solely on its textual outputs.\nFurther analysis shows that these traces are embedded in intermediate\nactivations and propagate nonlinearly to the final layer, forming\nlow-dimensional, learnable manifolds in activation space. Through extensive\nexperiments, we show that forget-relevant prompts enable over 90% accuracy in\ndetecting unlearning traces across all model sizes. Even with forget-irrelevant\ninputs, large LLMs maintain high detectability, demonstrating the broad\napplicability of unlearning trace detection.

Contemporary approaches, notably diffusion\nand flow-based models, have achieved solid graph generative performance through\nconstructing a probability path that interpolates between a reference\ndistribution and the data distribution. However, these methods typically model\nthe evolution of individual nodes and edges independently and use linear\ninterpolations to build the path assuming that the data lie in Euclidean space.\nWe show that this is suboptimal given the intrinsic non-Euclidean structure and\ninterconnected patterns of graphs, and it poses risks to the sampling\nconvergence. To build a better probability path, we model the joint evolution\nof the nodes and edges by representing graphs as connected systems\nparameterized by Markov random fields (MRF).

This work presents a novel Inverse Elasticity\nPhysics-Informed Neural Network (IE-PINN) specifically designed to robustly\nreconstruct heterogeneous distributions of elasticity parameters from noisy\ndisplacement data based on linear elasticity physics. IE-PINN integrates three\ndistinct neural network architectures dedicated to separately modeling\ndisplacement fields, strain fields, and elasticity distributions, thereby\nsignificantly enhancing stability and accuracy against measurement noise.\nAdditionally, a two-phase estimation strategy is introduced: the first phase\nrecovers relative spatial distributions of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio,\nand the second phase calibrates the absolute scale of Young's modulus using\nimposed loading boundary conditions. Additional methodological innovations,\nincluding positional encoding, sine activation functions, and a sequential\npretraining protocol, further enhance the model's performance and robustness.\nExtensive numerical experiments demonstrate that IE-PINN effectively overcomes\ncritical limitations encountered by existing methods, delivering accurate\nabsolute-scale elasticity estimations even under severe noise conditions.

To fix this, we ran a thorough study - it included seven\nwell-known GNN architectures. We also used a large group of 30 single plus\nmixed loss functions.

Our evaluation spanned three distinct real-world datasets, assessing\nperformance in both inductive and transductive settings using 21 comprehensive\nevaluation metrics.

In this work, we challenge that assumption by examining how expert\nfine-tuning affects model upcycling.

In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside\nfeature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node\npermutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end,\nwe first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant\nto permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features.\nWe then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on\nmultisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries.

Given a weight matrix of a pre-trained model, our\nmethod applies SVD to it and introduces a learnable router to adjust its\nsingular values based on tasks and samples. Accordingly, the weight matrix\nbecomes a Mixture of Orthogonal Rank-one Experts (MoORE), in which each expert\ncorresponds to the outer product of a left singular vector and the\ncorresponding right one. We can improve the model capacity by imposing a\nlearnable orthogonal transform on the right singular vectors. Unlike low-rank\nadaptation (LoRA) and its MoE-driven variants, MoORE guarantees the experts'\northogonality and maintains the column space of the original weight matrix.\nThese two properties make the adapted model resistant to the conflicts among\nthe new tasks and the oblivion of its original tasks, respectively.

Well-known examples of such partial rewards include\nexplicit ratings in content recommendations, conversion signals on e-commerce\nplatforms that are partial due to delay, and the issue of censoring in medical\nproblems.

This study\naddresses these challenges by proposing a stacking-based ensemble learning\napproach to improve the predictive accuracy of depression classification among\nprofessionals. The Depression Professional Dataset has been collected from\nKaggle. The dataset comprises demographic, occupational, and lifestyle\nattributes that influence mental well-being. Our stacking model integrates\nmultiple base learners with a logistic regression-mediated model, effectively\ncapturing diverse learning patterns. The experimental results demonstrate that\nthe proposed model achieves high predictive performance, with an accuracy of\n99.64% on training data and 98.75% on testing data, with precision, recall, and\nF1-score all exceeding 98%.

Accepted to ICML 2025", "summary": "Distribution matching (DM) is a versatile domain-invariant representation\nlearning technique that has been applied to tasks such as fair classification,\ndomain adaptation, and domain translation. Non-parametric DM methods struggle\nwith scalability and adversarial DM approaches suffer from instability and mode\ncollapse. While likelihood-based methods are a promising alternative, they\noften impose unnecessary biases through fixed priors or require explicit\ndensity models (e.g., flows) that can be challenging to train. We address this\nlimitation by introducing a novel approach to training likelihood-based DM\nusing expressive score-based prior distributions. Our key insight is that\ngradient-based DM training only requires the prior's score function -- not its\ndensity -- allowing us to train the prior via denoising score matching. This\napproach eliminates biases from fixed priors (e.g., in VAEs), enabling more\neffective use of geometry-preserving regularization, while avoiding the\nchallenge of learning an explicit prior density model (e.g., a flow-based\nprior). Our method also demonstrates better stability and computational\nefficiency compared to other diffusion-based priors (e.g., LSGM). Furthermore,\nexperiments demonstrate superior performance across multiple tasks,\nestablishing our score-based method as a stable and effective approach to\ndistribution matching.

We seek a general theory of bandit learnability,\nakin to the PAC framework for classification. Our investigation is guided by\nthe following two questions: (1) which classes F are learnable, and (2) how\nthey are learnable. For example, in the case of binary PAC classification,\nlearnability is fully determined by a combinatorial dimension - the VC\ndimension- and can be attained via a simple algorithmic principle, namely,\nempirical risk minimization (ERM). In contrast to classical learning-theoretic\nresults, our findings reveal limitations of learning in structured bandits,\noffering insights into the boundaries of bandit learnability. First, for the\nquestion of \"which\", we show that the paradigm of identifying the learnable\nclasses via a dimension-like quantity fails for bandit learning. We give a\nsimple proof demonstrating that no combinatorial dimension can characterize\nbandit learnability, even in finite classes, following a standard definition of\ndimension introduced by Ben-David et al. (2019). For the question of \"how\", we\nprove a computational hardness result: we construct a reward function class for\nwhich at most two queries are needed to find the optimal action, yet no\nalgorithm can do so in polynomial time unless RP=NP. We also prove that this\nclass admits efficient algorithms for standard algorithmic operations often\nconsidered in learning theory, such as an ERM. This implies that computational\nhardness is in this case inherent to the task of bandit learning.

Building human-like causal competency into\nmachine learning systems may facilitate the construction of effective and\ninterpretable AI. Indeed, the machine learning community has been importing\nideas on causality formalized by the Structural Causal Model (SCM) framework,\nwhich provides a rigorous formal language for many aspects of causality and has\nled to significant advances. However, the SCM framework fails to capture some\nsalient aspects of human causal cognition and has likewise not yet led to\nadvances in machine learning in certain critical areas where humans excel. We\ncontend that the problem of causality in the ``human niche'' -- for a social,\nautonomous, and goal-driven agent sensing and acting in the world in which\nhumans live -- is quite different from the kind of causality captured by SCMs.\nFor example, everyday objects come in similar types that have similar causal\nproperties, and so humans readily generalize knowledge of one type of object\n(cups) to another related type (bowls) by drawing causal analogies between\nobjects with similar properties, but such analogies are at best awkward to\nexpress in SCMs. We explore how such causal capabilities are adaptive in, and\nmotivated by, the human niche. By better appreciating properties of human\ncausal cognition and, crucially, how those properties are adaptive in the niche\nin which humans live, we hope that future work at the intersection of machine\nlearning and causality will leverage more human-like inductive biases to create\nmore capable, controllable, and interpretable systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u7279\u6027\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347AI\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6b64\u65b9\u9762\u8f83\u5f31\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08SCM\uff09\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5728\u2018\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u6001\u4f4d\u2019\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "SCM\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u6bd4\u6cdb\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5177\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, many real-world\nproblems exhibit temporal dependence and strong correlations between the\nmarginal distributions of the data-generating process, suggesting that the\ni.i.d. assumption is often unrealistic. In such cases, models naturally include\ntime-series processes with mixing properties, as well as irreducible and\naperiodic ergodic Markov chains. Moreover, the learning rates typically\nobtained in these settings are independent of the data distribution, which can\nlead to restrictive choices of hypothesis classes and suboptimal sample\ncomplexities for the learning algorithm. In this article, we consider the case\nwhere the training dataset is generated by an iterated random function (i.e.,\nan iteratively defined time-homogeneous Markov chain) that is not necessarily\nirreducible or aperiodic.

For example, users are often advised not to end their\nprompts with a space because it prevents the model from including the space as\npart of the next token. This Prompt Boundary Problem (PBP) also arises in\nlanguages such as Chinese and in code generation, where tokens often do not\nline up with syntactic boundaries. Additionally mismatching tokenizers often\nhinder model composition and interoperability.

To address these issues, we present an inference-time method to\nconvert any autoregressive LM with a BPE tokenizer into a character-level or\nbyte-level LM, without changing its generative distribution at the text level.\nOur method efficient solves the PBP and is also able to unify the vocabularies\nof language models with different tokenizers, allowing one to ensemble LMs with\ndifferent tokenizers at inference time as well as transfer the post-training\nfrom one model to another using proxy-tuning.

In the age\nof high-resolution telescopes such as JWST and ALMA, the substructure of many\nobjects can be resolved, raising the need for astrochemical modeling at these\nsmaller scales, meaning that the simulations of these objects need to include\nboth the physics and chemistry to accurately model the observations. The\ncomputational cost of the simulations coupling both the three-dimensional\nhydrodynamics and chemistry is enormous, creating an opportunity for surrogate\nmodels that can effectively substitute the chemical solver. In this work we\npresent surrogate models that can replace the original chemical code, namely\nLatent Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations.

Despite the typically low performance on ARC, the\ndeep learning paradigm remains the most effective known strategy for generating\nskillful (state-of-the-art) neural networks (NN) across varied modalities and\ntasks in vision, language etc. The deep learning paradigm has proven to be able\nto train these skillful neural networks and learn the abstractions needed in\nthese diverse domains. Our work doubles down on that and continues to leverage\nthis paradigm by incorporating on-the-fly NN training at test time. We\ndemonstrate that fully committing to deep learning's capacity to acquire novel\nabstractions yields state-of-the-art performance on ARC. Specifically, we treat\nboth the neural network and the optimizer (rather than just a pre-trained\nnetwork) as integral components of the inference process, fostering\ngeneralization to unseen tasks. Concretely, we propose a methodology for\ntraining on ARC, starting from pretrained LLMs, and enhancing their ARC\nreasoning. We also propose Test-Time Fine-Tuning (TTFT) and the Augment\nInference Reverse-Augmentation and Vote (AIRV) as effective test-time\ntechniques. We are the first to propose and show deep learning can be used\neffectively for ARC, showing boosts of up to 260% in accuracy with AIRV and a\nfurther 300% boost with TTFT. An early version of this approach secured first\nplace in the 2023 ARCathon competition, while the final version achieved the\ncurrent best score on the ARC private test-set (58%).

That suggests retrieval and diffusion can be co-optimized for faster,\nmore reliable structure-based drug design.", "AI": {"tldr": "READ\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4e0eSE(3)-\u7b49\u53d8\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55\u62df\u5408\u4e0e\u5316\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55\u62df\u5408\u4e0e\u5316\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u836f\u7269\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165READ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4e0eSE(3)-\u7b49\u53d8\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u68c0\u7d22\u652f\u67b6\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u6307\u5bfc\u53cd\u5411\u6269\u6563\u3002", "result": "\u5728CBGBench\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5929\u7136\u914d\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u52a0\u901f\u7ed3\u6784\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

The central classification task in\nelection tabulation is deciding whether a mark does or does not appear on a\nbubble associated to an alternative in a contest on the ballot. Barretto et al.\n(E-Vote-ID 2021) reported that convolutional neural networks are a viable\noption in this field, as they outperform simple feature-based classifiers.\n  Our contributions to election security can be divided into four parts. To\ndemonstrate and analyze the hypothetical vulnerability of machine learning\nmodels on election tabulators, we first introduce four new ballot datasets.\nSecond, we train and test a variety of different models on our new datasets.\nThese models include support vector machines, convolutional neural networks (a\nbasic CNN, VGG and ResNet), and vision transformers (Twins and CaiT). Third,\nusing our new datasets and trained models, we demonstrate that traditional\nwhite box attacks are ineffective in the voting domain due to gradient masking.\nOur analyses further reveal that gradient masking is a product of numerical\ninstability. We use a modified difference of logits ratio loss to overcome this\nissue (Croce and Hein, ICML 2020). Fourth, in the physical world, we conduct\nattacks with the adversarial examples generated using our new methods.

However, classical models like\nthe Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) are fundamentally limited by their\nparsimonious and single-regime structure. They fail to capture the multi-modal\nnature of human driving, where a single driving state (e.g., speed, relative\nspeed, and gap) can elicit many different driver actions. This forces the model\nto average across distinct behaviors, reducing its fidelity and making its\nparameters difficult to interpret. To overcome this, we introduce a\nregime-switching framework that allows driving behavior to be governed by\ndifferent IDM parameter sets, each corresponding to an interpretable behavioral\nmode. This design enables the model to dynamically switch between interpretable\nbehavioral modes, rather than averaging across diverse driving contexts. We\ninstantiate the framework using a Factorial Hidden Markov Model with IDM\ndynamics (FHMM-IDM), which explicitly separates intrinsic driving regimes\n(e.g., aggressive acceleration, steady-state following) from external traffic\nscenarios (e.g., free-flow, congestion, stop-and-go) through two independent\nlatent Markov processes. Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nis used to jointly estimate the regime-specific parameters, transition\ndynamics, and latent state trajectories. Experiments on the HighD dataset\ndemonstrate that FHMM-IDM uncovers interpretable structure in human driving,\neffectively disentangling internal driver actions from contextual traffic\nconditions and revealing dynamic regime-switching patterns. This framework\nprovides a tractable and principled solution to modeling context-dependent\ndriving behavior under uncertainty, offering improvements in the fidelity of\ntraffic simulations, the efficacy of safety analyses, and the development of\nmore human-centric ADAS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u5207\u6362\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff08FHMM-IDM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u8ddf\u8f66\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982IDM\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8ddf\u8f66\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982IDM\uff09\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u5355\u4e00\u72b6\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u5207\u6362\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff08FHMM-IDM\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u79bb\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u4f30\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728HighD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFHMM-IDM\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u72b6\u6001\u5207\u6362\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FHMM-IDM\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4ee5\u53caADAS\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}
