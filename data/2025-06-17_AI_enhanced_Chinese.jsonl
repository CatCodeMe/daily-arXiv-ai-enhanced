This scheduling strategy maximizes the aggregate QoS by optimizing\ntask execution without disrupting the existing periodic workload, while also\nadhering to periodicity, precedence, and resource constraints.Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method achieves enhanced load balancing and\nresource utilization, highlighting its potential to improve performance in\nheterogeneous MEC infrastructures supporting real-time, periodic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684HEFT\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u9884\u5360\u7528\u7684MEC\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8c03\u5ea6\u5468\u671f\u6027DAG\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316QoS\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u5bf9\u7ef4\u6301QoS\u548c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5f02\u6784MEC\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684HEFT\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5904\u7406\u5668\u7a7a\u95f2\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8d85\u5468\u671f\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u6784MEC\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2d\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We also compare the performance of our algorithm\nfor different traffic distributions. Finally, in order to assess the time\ncomputing penalty of dynamic wavelength optimisation in the merging DBA\nalgorithm, we compare it against a baseline Static Wavelength Allocation (SWA)\nalgorithm, where ONUs are designated a fixed wavelength for transmission.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6ce2\u957f\u5206\u914d\uff08DTWA\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79df\u6237PON\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u865a\u62df\u5316DBA\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u901a\u9053\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Numba API\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u865a\u62df\u5316\u65e0\u6e90\u5149\u7f51\u7edc\uff08vPONs\uff09\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u63a5\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u672c\u652f\u51fa\u548c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79df\u6237\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDTWA\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u865a\u62dfDBA\u5408\u5e76\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u5e26\u5bbd\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u901a\u9053\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528Numba API\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e6G\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5355\u901a\u9053\u4e0e\u591a\u901a\u9053PON\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0a\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "DTWA\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79df\u6237PON\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u52a8\u6001\u6ce2\u957f\u4f18\u5316\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

We\ndescribe its initial evaluation strategy conducted in a workshop with a network\nof SE researchers experienced in industry-academia collaboration and report the\nevaluation of its three assessment criteria (valuable, feasible, and\napplicable) regarding their importance in assessing practical relevance.\n[Method] We applied LRI retroactively to a published research paper, engaging\nworkshop participants in discussing and assessing the research problem by\napplying the proposed criteria using a semantic differential scale.\nParticipants provided feedback on the criteria's importance and completeness,\ndrawn from their own experiences in industry-academia collaboration. [Results]\nThe findings reveal an overall agreement on the importance of the three\ncriteria - valuable (83.3%), feasible (76.2%), and applicable (73.8%) - for\naligning research problems with industrial needs. Qualitative feedback\nsuggested adjustments in terminology with a clearer distinction between\nfeasible and applicable, and refinements for valuable by more clearly\nconsidering business value, ROI, and originality.

In this setting, a\n$k$-list learner outputs a list of $k$ potential predictions for an instance\n$x$ and incurs a loss if the true label of $x$ is not included in the list. A\nbasic result in the multiclass PAC framework with a finite number of labels\nstates that private learnability is equivalent to online learnability [Alon,\nLivni, Malliaris, and Moran (2019); Bun, Livni, and Moran (2020); Jung, Kim,\nand Tewari (2020)]. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that this equivalence does\nnot hold in the context of list learning. Specifically, we prove that, unlike\nin the multiclass setting, a finite $k$-Littlestone dimensio--a variant of the\nclassical Littlestone dimension that characterizes online $k$-list\nlearnability--is not a sufficient condition for DP $k$-list learnability.\nHowever, similar to the multiclass case, we prove that it remains a necessary\ncondition.\n  To demonstrate where the equivalence breaks down, we provide an example\nshowing that the class of monotone functions with $k+1$ labels over\n$\\mathbb{N}$ is online $k$-list learnable, but not DP $k$-list learnable. This\nleads us to introduce a new combinatorial dimension, the \\emph{$k$-monotone\ndimension}, which serves as a generalization of the threshold dimension.

Experiments on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench\nVerified demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned with our CoT dataset achieve\nsubstantial improvements over baselines.Notably, Qwen2.5-72B- Instruct achieves\n28.3%(Lite) and 35.0%(Verified) resolution rates, surpassing SOTA baseline\nSWE-Fixer-Qwen-72B with the same parameter scale, which only reached\n24.7%(Lite) and 32.8%(Verified).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMCTS-REFINE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfCoT\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14CoT\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u56e0\u5f31\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u7684MCTS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u91c7\u6837\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528MCTS-REFINE\u751f\u6210\u7684CoT\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LLM\u5728SWE-bench\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "MCTS-REFINE\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfCoT\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

State-of-the-art quantum\ncircuit optimizers rely on heuristics and typically require superlinear, and\neven exponential, time. Recent work proposed a new approach that pursues a\nweaker form of optimality called local optimality. Parameterized by a natural\nnumber $\\Omega$, local optimality insists that each and every $\\Omega$-segment\nof the circuit is optimal with respect to an external optimizer, called the\noracle. Local optimization can be performed using only a linear number of calls\nto the oracle but still incurs quadratic computational overheads in addition to\noracle calls. Perhaps most importantly, the algorithm is sequential.\n  In this paper, we present a parallel algorithm for local optimization of\nquantum circuits. To ensure efficiency, the algorithm operates by keeping a set\nof fingers into the circuit and maintains the invariant that a $\\Omega$-deep\ncircuit needs to be optimized only if it contains a finger. Operating in\nrounds, the algorithm selects a set of fingers, optimizes in parallel the\nsegments containing the fingers, and updates the finger set to ensure the\ninvariant. For constant $\\Omega$, we prove that the algorithm requires\n$O(n\\lg{n})$ work and $O(r\\lg{n})$ span, where $n$ is the circuit size and $r$\nis the number of rounds.

Most existing methods\nhave two limitations: (i) low robustness in handling corrupted image data\ncollected by IoT devices; and (ii) high consumption of computational and\ntransmission resources. To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear\ntransformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature\nmaps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to\nimprove the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution\nfilters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small\nset of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on\nvanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several\ngroups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse\nfeature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively\nreduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training\nby setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not\nupdating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by\nusing NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated\nbased on sliding windows.

Numerous pruning techniques have\nbeen proposed over time. They are becoming increasingly effective, but more\ncomplex and harder to interpret as well. Given the inherent complexity of\nneural networks, we argue that manually designing pruning criteria has reached\na bottleneck. To address this, we propose a novel approach in which we \"use a\nneural network to prune neural networks\".

In this paper, we first establish a bijective\nmapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural\nnetwork as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning\nstrategy automatically which can transform a network that is hard to prune into\nanother network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained,\nour pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and\nthe standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art.

This paper investigates two approaches for\nleveraging LLMs to answer questions over software models: direct prompting,\nwhere the whole software model is provided in the context, and an agentic\napproach combining LLM-based agents with general-purpose file access tools. We\nevaluate these approaches using an Ecore metamodel designed for timing analysis\nand software optimization in automotive and embedded domains. Our findings show\nthat while the agentic approach achieves accuracy comparable to direct\nprompting, it is significantly more efficient in terms of token usage.

To\naddress these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary\nframework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a\nparticular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud\nframework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers,\nand cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model\ninference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to\na series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling\neffective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource\nconstraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based\nintelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging\ncommunication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI\nmodels across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses\nthe capability of any single model.

Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these advanced\ntechniques in the context of regression bugs remains largely unexplored. This\ngap motivates the need for an empirical study evaluating the effectiveness of\nmodern APR techniques in fixing real-world regression bugs.\n  In this work, we conduct an empirical study of APR techniques on Java\nregression bugs. To facilitate our study, we introduce RegMiner4APR, a\nhigh-quality benchmark of Java regression bugs integrated into a framework\ndesigned to facilitate APR research. The current benchmark includes 99\nregression bugs collected from 32 widely used real-world Java GitHub\nrepositories. We begin by conducting an in-depth analysis of the benchmark,\ndemonstrating its diversity and quality. Building on this foundation, we\nempirically evaluate the capabilities of APR to regression bugs by assessing\nboth traditional APR tools and advanced LLM-based APR approaches.

We optimize the use of influence scores\nto identify poisoned samples within the training dataset. Furthermore, by\nquantifying the difference between the contribution of model parameters on the\ntaining data and the clean data, the target parameters are dynamically adjusted\nto eliminate the impact of the backdoor attacks. Experiments on public datasets\nunder the assumptions of closed-world (CW) and open-world (OW) verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. In complex scenes containing both clean\nwebsite fingerprinting features and backdoor triggers, the accuracy of the\nmodel on the poisoned dataset and the test dataset is stable at about 80%,\nsignificantly outperforming the traditional WF attack models.

Each agent transition, memory fragment, and\nreasoning step is committed within a Merkle structure rooted on-chain,\nrendering it non-repudiable and auditably permanent. To ensure selective access\nand confidentiality, we derive symmetric encryption keys from ECDH exchanges\ncontextualised by hierarchical privilege lattices. This enforces cryptographic\naccess control over append-only DAG-structured knowledge graphs. Reasoning is\nconstrained by formal logic systems and verified through deterministic\ntraversal of policy-encoded structures. Updates are non-destructive and\nhistoried, preserving epistemic lineage without catastrophic forgetting.\nZero-knowledge proofs facilitate verifiable, privacy-preserving inclusion\nattestations. Collectively, this architecture reframes memory not as a cache\nbut as a ledger - one whose contents are enforced by protocol, bound by\ncryptography, and constrained by formal logic. The result is not an intelligent\nagent that mimics thought, but an epistemic entity whose outputs are provably\nderived, temporally anchored, and impervious to post hoc revision.

In unsupervised healthcare data analysis, interpreting clustered data\ncan offer meaningful insights into patients' health outcomes, which hold direct\nimplications for healthcare providers. This paper addresses the problem of\ninterpreting clustered sensor data collected from older adult patients\nrecovering from lower-limb fractures in the community. A total of 560 days of\nmultimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS\nlocation, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely\ncollected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately\nfor each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each\nmodality on patients' recovery trajectories. Then, using context-aware\nprompting, a large language model was employed to infer meaningful cluster\nlabels for the clusters derived from each modality.

Given a new dataset, they need to\ndetermine the most suitable deep learning (DL) pipeline, consisting of the\npretrained model and the hyperparameters for finetuning to it. Moreover, as\nmodels grow in scale, the increasing reliance on real-world data poses a\nbottleneck for training and requires leveraging data more effectively.\nAddressing the first challenge often involves manual model selection and\nhyperparameter tuning. At the same time, as models grow larger and more and\nmore of the available human-generated data is being used for training, data\naugmentation and synthetic data become critical elements. Automated machine\nlearning offers a path to address these challenges but is traditionally\ndesigned for tabular data and classical ML methods. This dissertation adopts\nmeta-learning to extend automated machine learning to the deep learning domain.\nWe propose empirical approaches to automate DL pipeline selection for Computer\nVision tasks using prior task knowledge to learn surrogate models for pipeline\nranking. Extending these methods to the language domain, we learn to finetune\nlarge language models. As a result, we show that our approach can outperform\nfinetuning foundation models.

Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as\npoints sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\\mathcal{M} \\subset\n\\mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a\nvariational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to\nembeddings that represent their coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric\ngraph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to\ndistances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem\ninto a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is\nsolved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a\ntheoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this\ndata-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline.

However, we then prove that in various natural\nscenarios including average-case inputs, sliding window masking and attention\nsinks, the optimal number $O(N/M)$ of small transformers suffice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u5927\u578bTransformer\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u4e86Transformer\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u66f4\u64c5\u957f\u5904\u7406\u77ed\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u6765\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3aN\u7684Transformer\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528O((N/M)^2)\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3aM\uff08M\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8eN\uff09\u7684\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u5e73\u5747\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c47\u805a\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700O(N/M)\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u5373\u53ef\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9700\u8981O((N/M)^2)\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u6a21\u62df\u5927\u578bTransformer\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ec5\u9700O(N/M)\u4e2a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4e3aTransformer\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Moreover, we introduce centroid alignment as a\ntractable and interpretable simplification of Jacobian alignment that\neffectively identifies and tracks the stages of deep network training dynamics.\nAccompanying\n\\href{https://thomaswalker1.github.io/blog/grokalign.html}{webpage} and\n\\href{https://github.com/ThomasWalker1/grokalign}{code}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGrokAlign\u7684Jacobian\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u7f51\u7edc\u7684Jacobian\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u65e9\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08\u5373grokking\u73b0\u8c61\uff09\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7Jacobian\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08GrokAlign\uff09\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b80\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "GrokAlign\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\uff09\u66f4\u65e9\u5b9e\u73b0grokking\uff0c\u4e14\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "Jacobian\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cGrokAlign\u548c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, the\neffectiveness of CoT reasoning is inconsistent across tasks with different\nreasoning types. This work presents a novel perspective to understand CoT\nbehavior through the lens of \\textit{confirmation bias} in cognitive\npsychology. Specifically, we examine how model internal beliefs, approximated\nby direct question-answering probabilities, affect both reasoning generation\n($Q \\to R$) and reasoning-guided answer prediction ($QR \\to A$) in CoT. By\ndecomposing CoT into a two-stage process, we conduct a thorough correlation\nanalysis in model beliefs, rationale attributes, and stage-wise performance.\nOur results provide strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, such that\nmodel beliefs not only skew the reasoning process but also influence how\nrationales are utilized for answer prediction. Furthermore, the interplay\nbetween task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the strength of beliefs\nalso provides explanations for CoT effectiveness across reasoning tasks and\nmodels.

This comprehensive review explores\nML methods designed to address the challenges posed by small data and\nclassifies them into a taxonomy to guide practical applications. Furthermore,\neach method in the taxonomy was thoroughly analysed, with a detailed discussion\nof its core concepts and an evaluation of its effectiveness in tackling small\ndata challenges, as demonstrated by application results in the upstream\nbioprocessing and other related domains.

Recently, deep learning-based MTSF models\nhave gained significant attention for their promising ability to mine semantics\n(global and local information) within MTS data. However, these models are\npervasively susceptible to missing values caused by malfunctioning data\ncollectors. These missing values not only disrupt the semantics of MTS, but\ntheir distribution also changes over time. Nevertheless, existing models lack\nrobustness to such issues, leading to suboptimal forecasting performance. To\nthis end, in this paper, we propose Multi-View Representation Learning\n(Merlin), which can help existing models achieve semantic alignment between\nincomplete observations with different missing rates and complete observations\nin MTS. Specifically, Merlin consists of two key modules: offline knowledge\ndistillation and multi-view contrastive learning. The former utilizes a teacher\nmodel to guide a student model in mining semantics from incomplete\nobservations, similar to those obtainable from complete observations.

Semivalues have been\nproposed for a variety of high-stakes decisions involving data, such as\ndetermining contributor compensation, acquiring data from external sources, or\nfiltering out low-value datapoints. In these applications, semivalues depend on\nthe specification of a utility function that maps subsets of data to a scalar\nscore. While it is broadly agreed that this utility function arises from a\ncomposition of a learning algorithm and a performance metric, its actual\ninstantiation involves numerous subtle modeling choices. We argue that this\nunderspecification leads to varying degrees of arbitrariness in semivalue-based\nvaluations. Small, but arguably reasonable changes to the utility function can\ninduce substantial shifts in valuations across datapoints. Moreover, these\nvaluation methodologies are also often gameable: low-cost adversarial\nstrategies exist to exploit this ambiguity and systematically redistribute\nvalue among datapoints. Through theoretical constructions and empirical\nexamples, we demonstrate that a bad-faith valuator can manipulate utility\nspecifications to favor preferred datapoints, and that a good-faith valuator is\nleft without principled guidance to justify any particular specification.

Recently, there has been growing interest in applying BO\nto problems where evaluation is cheaper and, thus, observations are more\nplentiful. An impediment to scaling BO to many observations, $N$, is the\n$O(N^3)$ scaling of a na{\\\"i}ve query of the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate.\nModern implementations reduce this to $O(N^2)$, but the GP remains a\nbottleneck. We propose Epistemic Nearest Neighbors (ENN), a surrogate that\nestimates function values and epistemic uncertainty from $K$ nearest-neighbor\nobservations. ENN has $O(N)$ query time and omits hyperparameter fitting,\nleaving uncertainty uncalibrated.

Recent advances in this\narea have leveraged deep neural networks and attention mechanisms to\neffectively represent sequential behaviors and time-sensitive interests.

Existing GNNs, unfortunately,\nfail to account for the uncertainty of class probabilities that vary with the\ndepth of the model, leading to unreliable and risky predictions in real-world\nscenarios. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose a novel Evidence Fusing\nGraph Neural Network (EFGNN for short) to achieve trustworthy prediction,\nenhance node classification accuracy, and make explicit the risk of wrong\npredictions. In particular, we integrate the evidence theory with multi-hop\npropagation-based GNN architecture to quantify the prediction uncertainty of\neach node with the consideration of multiple receptive fields. Moreover, a\nparameter-free cumulative belief fusion (CBF) mechanism is developed to\nleverage the changes in prediction uncertainty and fuse the evidence to improve\nthe trustworthiness of the final prediction.

However, the temporal extension in dynamic graphs poses significant\ndata efficiency challenges, including increased data volume, high\nspatiotemporal redundancy, and reliance on costly dynamic graph neural networks\n(DGNNs). To alleviate the concerns, we pioneer the study of dynamic graph\ncondensation (DGC), which aims to substantially reduce the scale of dynamic\ngraphs for data-efficient DGNN training. Accordingly, we propose DyGC, a novel\nframework that condenses the real dynamic graph into a compact version while\nfaithfully preserving the inherent spatiotemporal characteristics.\nSpecifically, to endow synthetic graphs with realistic evolving structures, a\nnovel spiking structure generation mechanism is introduced. It draws on the\ndynamic behavior of spiking neurons to model temporally-aware connectivity in\ndynamic graphs. Given the tightly coupled spatiotemporal dependencies, DyGC\nproposes a tailored distribution matching approach that first constructs a\nsemantically rich state evolving field for dynamic graphs, and then performs\nfine-grained spatiotemporal state alignment to guide the optimization of the\ncondensed graph. Experiments across multiple dynamic graph datasets and\nrepresentative DGNN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of DyGC.\nNotably, our method retains up to 96.2% DGNN performance with only 0.5% of the\noriginal graph size, and achieves up to 1846 times training speedup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u538b\u7f29\uff08DGC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5DyGC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u89c4\u6a21\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u9ad8\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DGNNs\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "DyGC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c16\u5cf0\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDyGC\u4ec5\u75280.5%\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u89c4\u6a21\u5373\u53ef\u4fdd\u755996.2%\u7684DGNN\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe1846\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "DyGC\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose\ncontext-oriented decomposition adaptation (CorDA), a novel method that\ninitializes adapters in a task-aware manner. Concretely, we develop\ncontext-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance\nmatrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the\ntarget task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its\ncorresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is\ncompacted into the principal components.

We further develop CorDA++ by\nderiving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal\ncomponents, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank\nallocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each\nlayer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank\nallocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a\nsignificant margin.

We investigate whether this extends\nfrom conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on\nmalicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable\nCoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly\nmisaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for\ntyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these\nmisaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (``I'll trick\nthe user...''), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (``Taking five\nsleeping pills at once is safe...''). Due to these rationalizations, monitors\nthat evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment.\n  Extending this setup, we also train reasoning models to perform narrow bad\nbehaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes\nbroad misalignment that remains hidden, which brings additional risk. We find\nthat reasoning models can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers,\ndemonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these\nbehaviors but is unreliable.\n  In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned\nintentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied.

Their construction involves aggregating criteria\nevaluations, a common practice in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA). In\nMCDA, various methods have been proposed to address key aspects of multiple\ncriteria evaluations, such as the measurement scales of the criteria, the\ndegree of acceptable compensation between them, and their potential\ninteractions. However, beyond producing a final score or classification, it is\nessential to ensure the explainability and interpretability of results as well\nas the procedure's transparency. This paper proposes a method for constructing\nexplainable and interpretable composite indicators using \"if..., then...\"\ndecision rules. We consider the explainability and interpretability of\ncomposite indicators in four scenarios: (i) decision rules explain numerical\nscores obtained from an aggregation of numerical codes corresponding to ordinal\nqualifiers; (ii) an obscure numerical composite indicator classifies units into\nquantiles; (iii) given preference information provided by a Decision Maker in\nthe form of classifications of some reference units, a composite indicator is\nconstructed using decision rules; (iv) the classification of a set of units\nresults from the application of an MCDA method and is explained by decision\nrules. To induce the rules from scored or classified units, we apply the\nDominance-based Rough Set Approach.

Inspired by\nstudies in neuroscience, we partition the layers of a pretrained transformer\nmodel into four expert modules, each corresponding to a well-studied cognitive\nbrain network. Our Brain-Like model has three key benefits over the state of\nthe art: First, the specialized experts are highly interpretable and\nfunctionally critical, where removing a module significantly impairs\nperformance on domain-relevant benchmarks. Second, our model outperforms\ncomparable baselines that lack specialization on seven reasoning benchmarks.\nAnd third, the model's behavior can be steered at inference time by selectively\nemphasizing certain expert modules (e.g., favoring social over logical\nreasoning), enabling fine-grained control over the style of its response.

Furthermore, we provide energy consumption estimates comparing\nthe SNN approach on conventional (x86, ARM) and neuromorphic (Loihi) hardware\nplatforms.

A fundamental operation in these networks is the\ntensor product, which interacts two geometric features in an equivariant manner\nto create new features. Due to the high computational complexity of the tensor\nproduct, significant effort has been invested to optimize the runtime of this\noperation. For example, Luo et al. (2024) recently proposed the Gaunt tensor\nproduct (GTP) which promises a significant speedup. In this work, we provide a\ncareful, systematic analysis of a number of tensor product operations. In\nparticular, we emphasize that different tensor products are not performing the\nsame operation. The reported speedups typically come at the cost of\nexpressivity. We introduce measures of expressivity and interactability to\ncharacterize these differences. In addition, we realized the original\nimplementation of GTP can be greatly simplified by directly using a spherical\ngrid at no cost in asymptotic runtime. This spherical grid approach is faster\non our benchmarks and in actual training of the MACE interatomic potential by\n30\\%. Finally, we provide the first systematic microbenchmarks of the various\ntensor product operations.

The\nglobal convergence proof poses a unique mathematical challenge that is not\nencountered in finite-dimensional neural network convergence analyses due to\n(1) the neural network training dynamics involving a non-local neural network\nkernel operator in the infinite-width hidden layer limit where the kernel lacks\na spectral gap for its eigenvalues and (2) the nonlinearity of the limit PDE\nsystem, which leads to a non-convex optimization problem, even in the\ninfinite-width hidden layer limit (unlike in typical neual network training\ncases where the optimization problem becomes convex in the large neuron limit).\nThe theoretical results are illustrated and empirically validated by numerical\nstudies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u9690\u85cf\u5355\u5143\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f34\u968f\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcPDE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcPDE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027PDE\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4f34\u968f\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcPDE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u4f34\u968fPDE\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u9690\u85cf\u5355\u5143\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcPDE\u89e3\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027PDE\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This encourages the\nemergenece of model context protocol (MCP), which defines the standard on how\nshould a LLM interact with external services, such as \\api and data. However,\nas MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces\nnew safety risks. In particular, MCP introduces third-party services, which are\nnot controlled by the LLM developers, into the agent systems. These third-party\nMCP services provider are potentially malicious and have the economic\nincentives to exploit vulnerabilities and sabotage user-agent interactions. In\nthis position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay\nclose attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop\nnew techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our\nposition, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \\framework, a\ncontrolled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems.

To address these limitations, this work proposes a\nphysics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed\nSpatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by refining transformer attention to\nintegrate the universal law of gravitation and explicitly incorporating\nconstraints from spatial interactions. Specifically, it (1) estimates two\nspatially explicit mass parameters based on inflow and outflow, (2) models the\nlikelihood of cross-unit interaction using closed-form solutions of spatial\ninteractions to constrain spatial modeling randomness, and (3) utilizes the\nlearned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon\nin transformer attention matrices. The underlying law of human activity can be\nexplicitly modeled by the proposed adaptive gravity model. Moreover, a parallel\nspatiotemporal graph convolution transformer structure is proposed for\nachieving a balance between coupled spatial and temporal learning. Systematic\nexperiments on six real-world large-scale activity datasets demonstrate the\nquantitative and qualitative superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks. Additionally, the learned gravity attention matrix can be\ndisentangled and interpreted based on geographical laws.

This supervision format is highly\npractical, as it mirrors real-world human feedback, such as thumbs-up/down\nsignals, and avoids the need for structured preference annotations. In\ncontrast, pairwise preference-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) rely on datasets with both preferred and dispreferred responses, which\nare harder to construct and less natural to collect. Among single-trajectory\napproaches, Direct Reward Optimization (DRO) has shown strong empirical\nperformance due to its simplicity and stability. However, DRO requires\napproximating a value function, which introduces several limitations: high\noff-policy variance, coupling between policy and value learning, and a lack of\nabsolute supervision on the policy itself. We introduce Reward Partitioning\nOptimization (RPO), a new method that resolves these limitations by removing\nthe need to model the value function. Instead, RPO normalizes observed rewards\nusing a partitioning approach estimated directly from data. This leads to a\nstraightforward supervised learning objective on the policy, with no auxiliary\nmodels and no joint optimization. RPO provides direct and stable supervision on\nthe policy, making it robust and easy to implement in practice.

By\nsignificantly reducing search time and maintaining accuracy under strict\nhardware constraints, MARCO bridges the gap between automated DNN design and\nCAD for edge AI deployment. MARCO's core technical contribution lies in its\nunique combination of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Conformal\nPrediction (CP) to accelerate the hardware/software co-design process for\ndeploying deep neural networks. Unlike conventional once-for-all (OFA) supernet\napproaches that require extensive pretraining, MARCO decomposes the NAS task\ninto a hardware configuration agent (HCA) and a Quantization Agent (QA). The\nHCA optimizes high-level design parameters, while the QA determines per-layer\nbit-widths under strict memory and latency budgets using a shared reward signal\nwithin a centralized-critic, decentralized-execution (CTDE) paradigm. A key\ninnovation is the integration of a calibrated CP surrogate model that provides\nstatistical guarantees (with a user-defined miscoverage rate) to prune\nunpromising candidate architectures before incurring the high costs of partial\ntraining or hardware simulation. This early filtering drastically reduces the\nsearch space while ensuring that high-quality designs are retained with a high\nprobability. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100\ndemonstrate that MARCO achieves a 3-4x reduction in total search time compared\nto an OFA baseline while maintaining near-baseline accuracy (within 0.3%).\nFurthermore, MARCO also reduces inference latency.

Moreover, using models with 120M to 1.5B\nparameters, we find that the power law is better demonstrated after subtracting\nthe optimal loss from the actual training loss, suggesting a more principled\nsetting for investigating the scaling law for diffusion models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u4f18\u635f\u5931\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6700\u4f18\u503c\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u4e3a\u96f6\u4e14\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u635f\u5931\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u635f\u5931\u503c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u635f\u5931\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5229\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u635f\u5931\u5de5\u5177\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e3b\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d28\u91cf\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u51cf\u53bb\u6700\u4f18\u635f\u5931\u540e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5e42\u5f8b\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u635f\u5931\u503c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We evaluate our approach on two unlearning benchmarks, TOFU and MUSE.\nResults show notable gains in both forget quality and retained performance in\ncomparison to prior approaches, suggesting that incorporating contrastive\ndecoding can offer an efficient, practical avenue for unlearning concepts in\nlarge-scale models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u654f\u611f\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u8bad\u7ec3\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728TOFU\u548cMUSE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Our approach decouples the\nsampling task from the variational ansatz by learning a continuous flow model\nthat targets a discretised, amplitude-supported subspace of the Hilbert space.\nThis overcomes limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and\nautoregressive methods, especially in regimes with long-range correlations and\nvolume-law entanglement. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model with both\nshort- and long-range interactions, our method achieves comparable ground state\nenergy errors with state-of-the-art matrix product states and lower energies\nthan autoregressive NQS. For systems up to 50 spins, we demonstrate high\naccuracy and robust convergence across a wide range of coupling strengths,\nincluding regimes where competing methods fail.

Our analysis suggests that both meta-prompting and proactivity\nare critical, resulting in 38.7% faster task completion times and 31.9% less\nuser burden relative to non-active baselines.

This allows upper bounds on\niteration complexities in terms of iterate-independent constants and enables us\nto compare iteration complexities between algorithms. Under this assumption it\nis straightforward to show the advantages of line searches over fixed step\nsizes, and that in some settings, gradient descent with line search has a\nbetter iteration complexity than accelerated methods with fixed step sizes.

Traditional sequential recommender systems utilize the order of items\nin users' historical interactions to predict the next item for the users.\nPosition embeddings, well-established in transformer-based architectures for\nnatural language processing tasks, effectively distinguish token positions in\nsequences. In sequential recommendation systems, position embeddings can\ncapture the order of items in a user's historical interaction sequence.\nNevertheless, this ordering does not consider the time elapsed between two\ninteractions of the same user (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month), referred to as\n\"user rhythm\". In mobile app recommendation datasets, the time between\nconsecutive user interactions is notably longer compared to other domains like\nmovies, posing significant challenges for sequential recommender systems.

However, these\nmethods typically assume that the expected reward function is known to the\nusers, an assumption that is often unrealistic in practice. Misspecification of\nthis link function can lead to the failure of all existing algorithms. In this\nwork, we address this critical limitation by introducing a new problem of\ngeneralized linear bandits with unknown reward functions, also known as single\nindex bandits. We first consider the case where the unknown reward function is\nmonotonically increasing, and propose two novel and efficient algorithms, STOR\nand ESTOR, that achieve decent regrets under standard assumptions. Notably, our\nESTOR can obtain the nearly optimal regret bound $\\tilde{O}_T(\\sqrt{T})$ in\nterms of the time horizon $T$. We then extend our methods to the\nhigh-dimensional sparse setting and show that the same regret rate can be\nattained with the sparsity index. Next, we introduce GSTOR, an algorithm that\nis agnostic to general reward functions, and establish regret bounds under a\nGaussian design assumption.

To address this, we propose a Hierarchical\nGroup-wise Ranking Framework with two key components. First, we apply residual\nvector quantization to user embeddings to generate hierarchical user codes that\npartition users into hierarchical, trie-structured clusters. Second, we apply\nlistwise ranking losses to user-item pairs at each level of the hierarchy,\nwhere shallow levels group loosely similar users and deeper levels group highly\nsimilar users, reinforcing learning-to-rank signals through progressively\nharder negatives.

We propose a general-purpose framework for constraint-aware\nrefinement that leverages denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs). Starting\nfrom a coarse prediction, our method iteratively refines it through a\ndeterministic diffusion trajectory guided by a learned prior and augmented by\nconstraint gradient corrections.

However, existing approaches\noften fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can\nstruggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning\ncapabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's\nexploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we\nintroduce \\textbf{Metis-RISE} (\\textbf{R}L \\textbf{I}ncentivizes and\n\\textbf{S}FT \\textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike\nconventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage,\nbeginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy\nOptimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning\ncapacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges\nidentified during RL: (1) \\textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks\nwhere the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which\nwe tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself;\nand (2) \\textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting\nexpert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This\nstrategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement\nforms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B\nparameters).

While these models have attained high accuracy\nby leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long\nchain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires\ngenerating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce\nthe KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these\nmethods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally,\nprior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the\nimportant prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this\npre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning\ntokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention,\nwhich accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention\nfor the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations\nfor the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group\ntogether semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids\nboth to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key\nvectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update\nprocess to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens,\nthereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens.

This paper argues that such unimodal explanations systematically\nmisrepresent and fail to capture the cross-modal influence that drives\nmultimodal model decisions, and the community should stop relying on them for\ninterpreting multimodal models. To support our position, we outline key\nprinciples for multimodal explanations grounded in modality: Granger-style\nmodality influence (controlled ablations to quantify how removing one modality\nchanges the explanation for another), Synergistic faithfulness (explanations\ncapture the model's predictive power when modalities are combined), and Unified\nstability (explanations remain consistent under small, cross-modal\nperturbations).

AlphaEvolve orchestrates an\nautonomous pipeline of LLMs, whose task is to improve an algorithm by making\ndirect changes to the code. Using an evolutionary approach, continuously\nreceiving feedback from one or more evaluators, AlphaEvolve iteratively\nimproves the algorithm, potentially leading to new scientific and practical\ndiscoveries. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach by\napplying it to a number of important computational problems. When applied to\noptimizing critical components of large-scale computational stacks at Google,\nAlphaEvolve developed a more efficient scheduling algorithm for data centers,\nfound a functionally equivalent simplification in the circuit design of\nhardware accelerators, and accelerated the training of the LLM underpinning\nAlphaEvolve itself.

They are widely used\nnowadays across numerous scientific and engineering domains, driving\nadvancements in both research and real-world applications. In our recent work,\nwe focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which\nwe refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which\nboth inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly\nsuitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached\nbinary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the\nAlchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key\ninsights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary\nANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically\nrepresented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of\nmodifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a\ngradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously,\nthe training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set\ntransitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief\nchange. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by\naddressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we\nshow that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured,\ngradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known\nshortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training\ndynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style\nchange operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction --\nthat align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u5143\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ANNs\uff09\u7684\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u5ff5\u53d8\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff08AGM\u6846\u67b6\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e8c\u5143ANNs\u56e0\u5176\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u9650\u5236\u4e3a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u503c\u800c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Dalal\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u53d8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7a33\u5065\u7684AGM\u98ce\u683c\u53d8\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u5178\u4fee\u8ba2\u548c\u9002\u5ea6\u6536\u7f29\uff09\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u4e8c\u5143ANNs\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e8c\u5143ANNs\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u53d8\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e14Dalal\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e8c\u5143ANNs\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u53d8\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Unlearning seeks to selectively\nremove specific data from trained models, such as personal information or\ncopyrighted content. Current approaches targeting specific output sequences at\nthe token level often fail to achieve complete forgetting and remain\nsusceptible to prompt rephrasing. We propose Align-then-Unlearn, a novel\nframework that performs unlearning in the semantic embedding space rather than\ndirectly on output tokens. Align-then-Unlearn first augments the LLM with an\nembedding prediction module trained to anticipate future context\nrepresentations. Unlearning is then achieved by fine-tuning the model to\nminimize the similarity between these predicted embeddings and a target\nembedding that represents the concept to be removed.

As a result, 1000s\nof hours have been spent on building such large-scale datasets around the\nglobe. Despite the continuous growth of such efforts, we still lack a\nsystematic understanding of what data should be collected to improve the\nutility of a robotics dataset and facilitate downstream policy learning. In\nthis work, we conduct a large-scale dataset composition study to answer this\nquestion. We develop a data generation framework to procedurally emulate common\nsources of diversity in existing datasets (such as sensor placements and object\ntypes and arrangements), and use it to generate large-scale robot datasets with\ncontrolled compositions, enabling a suite of dataset composition studies that\nwould be prohibitively expensive in the real world. We focus on two practical\nsettings: (1) what types of diversity should be emphasized when future\nresearchers collect large-scale datasets for robotics, and (2) how should\ncurrent practitioners retrieve relevant demonstrations from existing datasets\nto maximize downstream policy performance on tasks of interest. Our study\nyields several critical insights -- for example, we find that camera poses and\nspatial arrangements are crucial dimensions for both diversity in collection\nand alignment in retrieval. In real-world robot learning settings, we find that\nnot only do our insights from simulation carry over, but our retrieval\nstrategies on existing datasets such as DROID allow us to consistently\noutperform existing training strategies by up to 70%.

The authors are listed in\n  alphabetical order. We open-source our MiniMax-M1 at\n  https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-M1", "summary": "We introduce MiniMax-M1, the world's first open-weight, large-scale\nhybrid-attention reasoning model. MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention\nmechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model,\nwhich contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters\nactivated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1\nmillion tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning\nattention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time\ncompute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that\nrequire processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained\nusing large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including\nsandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to\nM1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel\nRL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling\nweights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants.\nCombining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on\n512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just\n$534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K\nthinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate\nphase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our\nmodels are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the\noriginal DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex\nsoftware engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks.

We propose a physics-informed variational autoencoder architecture that\ncombines the interpretability of physics-based models with the flexibility of\ndata-driven models. To promote disentanglement of the known physics and\nconfounding influences, the latent space is partitioned into physically\nmeaningful variables that parametrize a physics-based model, and data-driven\nvariables that capture variability in the domain and class of the physical\nsystem. The encoder is coupled with a decoder that integrates physics-based and\ndata-driven components, and constrained by an adversarial training objective\nthat prevents the data-driven components from overriding the known physics,\nensuring that the physics-grounded latent variables remain interpretable. We\ndemonstrate that the model is able to disentangle features of the input signal\nand separate the known physics from confounding influences using supervision in\nthe form of class and domain observables.

Recently, Nguyen et al.\n2024's \"Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM\nOutputs\" introduced a new sampler called min-p, claiming it achieves superior\nquality and diversity over established samplers such as basic, top-k, and top-p\nsampling.
