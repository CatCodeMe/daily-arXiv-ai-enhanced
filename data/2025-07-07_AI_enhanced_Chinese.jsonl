Existing\nautomated integration methods, such as Full Disjunction (FD)-based models like\nALITE, prioritize completeness but result in schema bloat, sparse attributes\nand limited business usability. We propose a novel hybrid, template-based\nschema matcher that aligns multi-layout tenancy schedules to a predefined\ntarget schema. The matcher combines schema (Jaccard, Levenshtein) and\ninstance-based metrics (data types, distributions) with globally optimal\nassignments determined via the Hungarian Algorithm. Evaluation against a\nmanually labeled ground truth demonstrates substantial improvements, with grid\nsearch optimization yielding a peak F1-score of 0.881 and an overall null\npercentage of 45.7%. On a separate ground truth of 20 semantically similar\ncolumn sets, ALITE achieves an F1-score of 0.712 and 75.6% nulls. These results\nsuggest that combining structured business knowledge with hybrid matching can\nyield more usable and business-aligned schema mappings.

Experimental results show that\nthe proposed method outperforms existing mainstream approaches in several key\nmetrics, including accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC. The model demonstrates stronger\ndiscriminative power and robustness.

It uses stateless clients and a server design that separates\nout the session state, which are periodically or incrementally checkpointed. We\ndemonstrate the modularity of Flotilla by evaluating five different FL\nstrategies for training five DNN models. We also evaluate the client and\nserver-side fault tolerance on 200+ clients, and showcase its ability to\nrapidly failover within seconds. Finally, we show that Flotilla's resource\nusage on Raspberry Pis and Nvidia Jetson edge accelerators are comparable to or\nbetter than three state-of-the-art FL frameworks, Flower, OpenFL and FedML. It\nalso scales significantly better compared to Flower for 1000+ clients. This\npositions Flotilla as a competitive candidate to build novel FL strategies on,\ncompare them uniformly, rapidly deploy them, and perform systems research and\noptimizations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Flotilla\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u5f02\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6545\u969c\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u4f2a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u8fb9\u7f18\u786c\u4ef6\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u5f02\u6b65\u805a\u5408\u548c\u6545\u969c\u6062\u590d\u3002", "method": "Flotilla\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u4f1a\u8bdd\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u5f02\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "Flotilla\u5728200+\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6545\u969c\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e14\u652f\u63011000+\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "Flotilla\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Based on this measure, a new feature\nselection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved\nsamples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory\nability.

Second, the lower boundary of\nthe probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature\nsubset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be\nestimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes\nwere used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate\nreducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory\nability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.\nExperiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate\nreduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a\npersonal computer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7c97\u7cd9\u96c6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6b63\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u7559\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u627e\u5230\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u673a\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8861\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u627e\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ea6\u7b80\uff0c\u4e14\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u9ad8\u4e8e\u9884\u4f30\u4e0b\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a\ncritical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and\npredictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in\nsemiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high\ndata dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,\nnoisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production\nsystems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the\ndelayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly\ndetection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic\napproach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed\nmethodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into\nimage-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)\ndeveloping a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16\narchitecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese\nnetwork composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned\nVGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one\nserving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the\nother as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the\nembeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at\na given time step.

FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding\nefficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important\ndraft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to\nprune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during\nverification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality\nspeculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline\nutilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world\ntestbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models\nand configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.36$\\times$-1.77$\\times$ compared\nto baselines.

Current approaches to fairness testing in large language\nmodels (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic\nheuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult\nto scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method\nfor testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific\nresources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,\nMeta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to\nuncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled\nmodifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,\nwe propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and\noutput evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and\nclassify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source\ntools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test\ncases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained\nLLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.\nThe results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,\nachieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of\nexecutions.

Despite\nthe prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture\nnon-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and\nconditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural\npreservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static\nstructures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual\nprocess complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce\nRLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process\ngraphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining\ntheory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively\ncombining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and\nemploys reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to\nautomatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process\ninstance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with\nrelation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next\nactivity.

While its effects on training\nstability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.\nAdditionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing\nadditional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual\nmodel components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every\nGPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03\ncross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in\nlanguage modeling.

The\nreliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR\ndata. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including\nmisrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they\nare primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality\nassessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess\ndata fitness for research.\n  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit\ntesting and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data\nquality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking\nTool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test\ngenerator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a\ntest suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework\nthat executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.\n  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and\nSyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These\ntests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We\npresent a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of\nreference grounding and value accuracy.\n  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable\ncontext-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to\nimprove the validity of its outcomes.

Crucially, this enables\nthe framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby\nfreeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely\non human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and\nseeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner\niteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,\nregularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and\nconstraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy\ncorresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at\nlower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression.

To unlock reasoning ability in such\nsettings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current\noutput distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good\npositive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a\nnatural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.\nInstead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they\nshould (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's\nlikelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we\npropose $\\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and\nmodular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the\nground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to\nproduce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written\nCoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.\nExperiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final\nperformance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based\nmethods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially\nstruggles the most.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aExPO\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6837\u672c\u4f9d\u8d56\u521d\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u80fd\u529b\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u4e14\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "ExPO\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982MATH level-5\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ExPO\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u6837\u672c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

In this paper, we\nfirst investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an\nempirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings\nreveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or\nsemantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to\ndifferentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)\nand those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical\nregions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time\ndecoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code\ngeneration. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)\nself-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks\nthem based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining\ndiversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies\ntokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling\ntemperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens\nand higher temperature for exploratory ones.

Notably, recent advances in\npre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated\nconsiderable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep\nlearning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain\nprompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of\ndisentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging\nthe controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text\nmodality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel\nframework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first\nautomatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)\nand then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the\ndisentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual\nfeature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be\ntoo complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address\nthis, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which\nextends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of\nabstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through\nstylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual\nrepresentations remain consistent across both the original and augmented\ndistributions.

However, for some applications, a\nmore suitable approach is to balance response time, safety of the paths, and\npath length. In this context, a skeleton map is a useful tool in graph-based\nschemes, as it provides an intrinsic representation of free configuration\nspace. However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being\nprimarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient\npath-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing\ntime. This methodology leverages a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on\nU-Net architecture to compute a skeletonized version of the navigation map,\nwhich we refer to as SkelUnet. The SkelUnet network facilitates exploration of\nthe entire workspace through one-shot sampling (OSS), as opposed to the\niterative process used by exact algorithms or the probabilistic sampling\nprocess. SkelUnet is trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 12,500\nbi-dimensional dungeon maps.

However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated\nmedical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,\nas a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective\nalternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble\nannotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks\nsufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for\ntraining segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel\nweakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key\ncomponents: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the\nboundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances\nfeature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity\ntransformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast\nvariations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by\nmasking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global\nanatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to\nrecover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper\nsemantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP\nmodule enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing\ndual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a\nboundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement.

Our findings\nreveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable\nportion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the\nfeature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC.

To achieve this, data scientists adaptively use problem\n(re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable\nfor another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g.,\npredictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable\nto capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives.
