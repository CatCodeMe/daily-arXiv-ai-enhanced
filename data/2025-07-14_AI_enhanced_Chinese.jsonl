We introduce H-Planarity as the problem of deciding whether a graph G\nhas a planar H-modulator. We prove that, if H is hereditary, CMSO-definable,\nand decidable in polynomial time, then H-Planarity is solvable in polynomial\ntime. Further, we introduce two parametric extensions of H-Planarity by\ndefining the notions of H-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth, which\ngeneralize the concepts of elimination distance and tree decompositions to the\nclass H. Combining this result with existing FPT algorithms for various\nH-modulator problems, we thereby obtain FPT algorithms parameterized by\nH-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth for numerous graph classes H. By\ncombining the well-known algorithmic properties of planar graphs and graphs of\nbounded treewidth, our methods for computing H-planar treedepth and H-planar\ntreewidth lead to a variety of algorithmic applications. For instance, once we\nknow that a given graph has bounded H-planar treedepth or bounded H-planar\ntreewidth, we can derive additive approximation algorithms for graph coloring\nand polynomial-time algorithms for counting (weighted) perfect matchings.\nFurthermore, we design Efficient Polynomial-Time Approximation Schemes\n(EPTAS-es) for several problems, including Maximum Independent Set.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u7684H-\u5e73\u9762\u8c03\u5236\u5668\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7H-\u5e73\u9762\u8c03\u5236\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u591a\u56fe\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97H-\u5e73\u9762\u8c03\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49H-\u5e73\u9762\u6811\u6df1\u548cH-\u5e73\u9762\u6811\u5bbd\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bH-\u5e73\u9762\u6027\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u591a\u79cdFPT\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u56fe\u7740\u8272\u3001\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5339\u914d\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86EPTAS\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We formulate a joint\noptimization problem that aims to minimize the peak AoI while determining\noptimal UAV trajectories and laser charging strategies. This problem is\nparticularly challenging due to its non-convex nature, complex temporal\ndependencies, and the need to balance data collection efficiency with energy\nconsumption constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nmulti-agent proximal policy optimization with temporal memory and multi-agent\ncoordination (MAPPO-TM) framework. Specifically, MAPPO-TM incorporates temporal\nmemory mechanisms to capture the dynamic nature of UAV operations and\nfacilitates effective coordination among multiple UAVs through decentralized\nlearning while considering global system objectives. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed MAPPO-TM algorithm outperforms conventional\napproaches in terms of peak AoI minimization and energy efficiency.

To\nbridge this gap, we introduce \\emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}\n(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the\nsimplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile\nrewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized\nRL objective.

Moreover, QRPO\nscales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new\ndimension for pre-computation scaling.

The model is equivalent to content-oblivious computation,\nwhere nodes communicate solely via pulses. They showed that if the network is\n2-edge-connected, then any algorithm for a noiseless setting can be simulated\nin the fully-defective setting; otherwise, no non-trivial computation is\npossible in the fully-defective setting. However, their simulation requires a\npredesignated leader, which they conjectured to be necessary for any\nnon-trivial content-oblivious task.\n  Recently, Frei, Gelles, Ghazy, and Nolin (DISC 2024) refuted this conjecture\nfor the special case of oriented ring topology. They designed two asynchronous\ncontent-oblivious leader election algorithms with message complexity $O(n \\cdot\n\\mathsf{ID}_{\\max})$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $\\mathsf{ID}_{\\max}$\nis the maximum $\\mathsf{ID}$.

A prominent subset of the workloads in such centers are\nworkflows with interdependent tasks, usually represented as directed acyclic\ngraphs (DAGs). To reduce the carbon emissions resulting from executing such\nworkflows in centers with a mixed (renewable and non-renewable) energy supply,\nit is advisable to move task executions to time intervals with sufficient green\nenergy when possible. To this end, we formalize the above problem as a\nscheduling problem with a given mapping and ordering of the tasks. We show that\nthis problem can be solved in polynomial time in the uniprocessor case. For at\nleast two processors, however, the problem becomes NP-hard. Hence, we propose a\nheuristic framework called CaWoSched that combines several greedy approaches\nwith local search. To assess the 16 heuristics resulting from different\ncombinations, we also devise a simple baseline algorithm and an exact ILP-based\nsolution.

Under this model, observed rankings are noisy\nperturbations of a central ranking $\\sigma$, with likelihood decaying\nexponentially in distance from $\\sigma$, i.e, $P (\\pi) \\propto \\exp\\big(-\\beta\n\\cdot d(\\pi, \\sigma)\\big),$ where $\\beta > 0$ controls dispersion and $d$ is a\ndistance function.\n  Existing methods mainly focus on fixed distances (such as Kendall's $\\tau$\ndistance), with no principled approach to learning the distance metric directly\nfrom data. In practice, however, rankings naturally vary by context; for\ninstance, in some sports we regularly see long-range swaps (a low-rank team\nbeating a high-rank one), while in others such events are rare.

Using this sampling algorithm, we\npropose an efficient Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithm that jointly\nestimates the central ranking, the dispersion parameter, and the optimal\ndistance metric.

Therefore, it is crucial\nto determine whether a given input could produce such errors. Researchers tend\nto take the results of high-precision floating-point programs as oracles for\ndetecting floating-point errors, which introduces two main limitations: (1)\ndifficulty of implementation and (2) prolonged execution time.

However, when the system operates in dynamic\nenvironments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates\nwill inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts,\nwhich reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and\nlocal drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such,\nexisting offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to\nthese implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration\nperformance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online\nconfiguration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to\nthese drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the\nlocal and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper\nlevel, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the\nlocal model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the\nlower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and\nadapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA\ncombines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize\nredundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight\nsoftware systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA\nachieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with\nup to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to\nimprove different local models in handling concept drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "DHDA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u7ebf\u914d\u7f6e\u6027\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u5c42\u6b21\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u66f4\u65b0\u7b49\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "method": "DHDA\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u5c42\u6b21\u9002\u5e94\uff1a\u4e0a\u5c42\u91cd\u65b0\u5212\u5206\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5168\u5c40\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4e0b\u5c42\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u5f02\u6b65\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u5c40\u90e8\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u5b9a\u671f\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cDHDA\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u6f02\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u53472\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5408\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "DHDA\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte\nCarlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise\nratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently\ndemonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of\nsource amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja\noffers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise\ncharacterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,\nreliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and\ndevice physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.", "AI": {"tldr": "RTNinja\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u6790\u968f\u673a\u7535\u62a5\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5373\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u85cf\u6e90\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u673a\u7535\u62a5\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u7eb3\u7c73\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "RTNinja\u5305\u542bLevelsExtractor\uff08\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u53bb\u566a\uff09\u548cSourcesMapper\uff08\u6982\u7387\u805a\u7c7b\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u57287000\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0cRTNinja\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u63d0\u53d6\u6e90\u7279\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RTNinja\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u7535\u62a5\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u7eb3\u7c73\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL\ntraining framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner\nacross clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data\nheterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.\nHowever, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting\nin heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge\nlearned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL\nframework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called\nSFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the\ncurrent round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled\nKnowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign\ndistinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based\non the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.\nThrough this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training\nefficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent\nknowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge\ndistillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.\nBased on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection\nmechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge\nspace coverage while reducing communication and computational costs.

The challenge is\neven greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the\ncanonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep\nlearning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.\nFurthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far\nlower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning\nframework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for\npredicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of\ntwo subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing\n(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant\nspecies. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering\npreviously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability\nanalyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing\nto its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational\nmethod and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a\nfoundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA\nannotation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6CircFormerMoE\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u690d\u7269\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4DNA\u9884\u6d4bcircRNAs\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709circRNA\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56RNA-seq\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4DNA\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u690d\u7269\u4e2dcircRNA\u526a\u63a5\u4f4d\u70b9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5178\u578bGT-AG\u6a21\u4f53\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "CircFormerMoE\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u526a\u63a5\u4f4d\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08SSD\uff09\u548c\u526a\u63a5\u4f4d\u70b9\u914d\u5bf9\uff08SSP\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4DNA\u9884\u6d4bcircRNAs\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u79cd\u690d\u7269\u57fa\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u672a\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684circRNAs\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "CircFormerMoE\u4e3a\u690d\u7269\u5927\u89c4\u6a21circRNA\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u690d\u7269\u529f\u80fd\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u548c\u975e\u7f16\u7801RNA\u6ce8\u91ca\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Sustainable\nirrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and\ndrying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping\nsecure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a\nkey component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited\ndata on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking\nand targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework\nto monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a\nregion facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect\nessential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's\nPromoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained\napproximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their\nfield-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with\nSentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and\nirrigation dimensions.

In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the\nforgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local\noverfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input\nspace. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without\nconventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent\nphenomenon.\n  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages\nthe training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten\nknowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by\ndistilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing\nperformance without added inference cost.\n  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and\ntraining regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the\npresence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge\nDistillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained\nensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference\ncomplexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8861\u91cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9057\u5fd8\u7387\u7684\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u84b8\u998f\uff09\u6765\u6062\u590d\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5f88\u5c11\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u53cc\u4e0b\u964d\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u96c6\u6210\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u539f\u59cb\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c40\u90e8\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u662f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u53cc\u8d62\u3002"}}

Notably, most interpretability\npapers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear\nrepresentation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a\nmodel's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by\nthe definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical\nfindings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to\nperfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of\nsolving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised\nlanguage models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention\naccuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear\nrepresentation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to\nalignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled\nway to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and\naccuracy.

To bridge these gaps, this work\npresents the Energy-based Parallel Graph Attention Neural Network, a novel\napproach for predicting future movements for multiple stocks. First, it\ngenerates a dynamic stock graph with the energy difference between stocks and\nBoltzmann distribution, capturing evolving inter-dependencies between stocks.\nThen, a parallel graph attention mechanism is proposed to preserve the\nhierarchical intra-stock dynamics.

This challenge persists due\nto the reluctance of companies to disclose incidents that could damage their\nreputation or investor confidence. Therefore, from an actuarial perspective,\npotential resolutions conclude two aspects: the enhancement of existing cyber\nincident datasets and the implementation of advanced modeling techniques to\noptimize the use of the available data. A review of existing data-driven\nmethods highlights a significant lack of entity-specific organizational\nfeatures in publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we propose a\nnovel InsurTech framework that enriches cyber incident data with\nentity-specific attributes. We develop various machine learning (ML) models: a\nmultilabel classification model to predict the occurrence of cyber incident\ntypes (e.g., Privacy Violation, Data Breach, Fraud and Extortion, IT Error, and\nOthers) and a multioutput regression model to estimate their annual\nfrequencies. While classifier and regressor chains are implemented to explore\ndependencies among cyber incident types as well, no significant correlations\nare observed in our datasets. Besides, we apply multiple interpretable ML\ntechniques to identify and cross-validate potential risk factors developed by\nInsurTech across ML models. We find that InsurTech empowered features enhance\nprediction occurrence and frequency estimation robustness compared to only\nusing conventional risk factors.

By drawing inspiration\nfrom classical problems in distributed systems and graph theory, AgentsNet\nmeasures the ability of multi-agent systems to collaboratively form strategies\nfor problem-solving, self-organization, and effective communication given a\nnetwork topology. We evaluate a variety of baseline methods on AgentsNet\nincluding homogeneous networks of agents which first have to agree on basic\nprotocols for organization and communication. We find that some frontier LLMs\nare already demonstrating strong performance for small networks but begin to\nfall off once the size of the network scales. While existing multi-agent\nbenchmarks cover at most 2-5 agents, AgentsNet is practically unlimited in size\nand can scale with new generations of LLMs. As such, we also probe frontier\nmodels in a setup with up to 100 agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentsNet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u501f\u9274\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u56fe\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1AgentsNet\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u4e0b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1bAgentsNet\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8fbe100\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentsNet\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

This is a tricky question to answer in general, as any function\nmatching the outputs on those examples can in principle be a correct\nextrapolant. We argue that a \"good\" extrapolant should follow certain kinds of\nrules, and here we study a particularly appealing criterion for rule-following\nin list functions: that the function should behave predictably even when\ncertain elements are removed. In functional programming, a standard way to\nexpress such removal operations is by using a filter function. Accordingly, our\npaper introduces a new semantic class of functions -- the filter equivariant\nfunctions. We show that this class contains interesting examples, prove some\nbasic theorems about it, and relate it to the well-known class of map\nequivariant functions. We also present a geometric account of filter\nequivariants, showing how they correspond naturally to certain simplicial\nstructures.
