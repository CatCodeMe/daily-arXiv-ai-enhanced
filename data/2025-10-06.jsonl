However, since its inception and consequent improvements, there have\nbeen no attempts to document a method which constrains the values of attributes\ncapable of only possessing a limited quantity of values. These non-limited\ndistinct attributes pose a problem throughout many relational databases as they\nhave the potential to cause data anomalies and query inaccuracies. Thus, a new\ndatabase normalization method, Limited Distinct Normal Form (LDNF), is\nnecessary in order to improve upon the currently established data normalization\nprocess. In brief, LDNF is a method which turns non-limited distinct attributes\ninto limited distinct attributes by forcing the attributes to conform to a\nlimited quantity of values. Utilizing LDNF in tandem with existing normal forms\nfulfills a need in normalization that is otherwise not present when only using\ncurrent methods. A formal approach to LDNF is therefore proposed."}

However, most production\nworkloads require high throughput and low resource utilization, so most\nresearch systems have seen little adoption. Instead, real world improvements in\ncompression are increasingly often realized by building application-specific\ncompressors which can exploit knowledge about the structure and semantics of\nthe data being compressed. These systems easily outperform even the best\ngeneric compressors, but application-specific compression schemes are not\nwithout drawbacks. They are inherently limited in applicability and are\ndifficult to maintain and deploy.\n  We show that these challenges can be overcome with a new way of thinking\nabout compression. We propose the ``graph model'' of compression, a new\ntheoretical framework for representing compression as a directed acyclic graph\nof modular codecs. This motivates OpenZL, an implementation of this model that\ncompresses data into a self-describing wire format, any configuration of which\ncan be decompressed by a universal decoder. OpenZL's design enables rapid\ndevelopment of tailored compressors with minimal code, its universal decoder\neliminates deployment lag, and its investment in a well-vetted standard\ncomponent library minimizes security risks. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat OpenZL achieves superior compression ratios and speeds compared to\nstate-of-the-art general-purpose compressors on a variety of real-world\ndatasets. Internal deployments at Meta have also shown consistent improvements\nin size and/or speed, with development timelines reduced from months to days.\nOpenZL thus represents an advance in practical, scalable, and maintainable data\ncompression for modern data-intensive applications."}

A key design principle is that\nboth the winning set and the per-QLAN quota are fixed by measurements alone, so\nthe contention loop requires no classical round trip.

To structure these findings, we\nclassify the issues based on when they arise during the software lifecycle:\nArchitecture, Implementation, and Deployment. The Architecture phase covers\nhigh-level decisions such as service decomposition and inter-service\ndependencies. The Implementation phase includes aspects like initialization\noverhead, metrics instrumentation, and error propagation. The Deployment phase\nfocuses on runtime configurations such as resource limits and health checks. We\nvalidate these considerations using the Sock-Shop benchmark and evaluate\ndiverse auto-scaling strategies, including threshold-based, control-theoretic,\nlearning-based, black-box optimization, and dependency-aware approaches. Our\nfindings show that overlooking key lifecycle concerns can degrade autoscaler\nperformance, while addressing them leads to more stable and efficient scaling.\nThese results underscore the importance of lifecycle-aware engineering for\nunlocking the full potential of auto-scaling in microservice-based systems."}

To our\nknowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic\nembedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's\narchitecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each\ncluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely\nlow-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per\ngroup while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage\nhierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to\nspecific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and\nthe volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision\nscheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled\nwith dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption\nto levels comparable to dense models.

This paper introduces a graph-centric, multimodal detector that fuses\nphysical-layer and behavioral indicators over ego-centric star subgraphs and\nshort temporal windows to detect passive attacks. To capture stealthy\nperturbations, a two-stage encoder is introduced: graph convolution aggregates\nspatial context across ego-centric star subgraphs, while a bidirectional GRU\nmodels short-term temporal dependencies. The encoder transforms heterogeneous\nfeatures into a unified spatio-temporal representation suitable for\nclassification.

However, unlike\nautoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for\nembodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot\nparallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action\ndepends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this\nend, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft\nmodel estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target\nmodel and selectively skips communication and computation for server\noperations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection\nprobability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the\npath deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference\nperformance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid\ninference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while\nlowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without\nskipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model\nonly inference."}

Existing\nmetrics have been used for this purpose, but they either fail to provide a\ncomprehensive basis for guiding oracle improvement, or they are tailored to\nspecific types of oracles, thus limiting their generality.\n  In this paper, we introduce state field coverage, a novel metric for\nassessing oracle quality. This metric measures the proportion of an object's\nstate, as statically defined by its class fields, that an oracle may access\nduring test execution. The main intuition of our metric is that oracles with a\nhigher state field coverage are more likely to detect faults in the software\nunder analysis, as they inspect a larger portion of the object states to\ndetermine whether tests pass or not.\n  We implement a mechanism to statically compute the state field coverage\nmetric.

We evaluate state field coverage through experiments involving 273\nrepresentation invariants and 249,027 test assertions.

We\nintroduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug\nabstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the\nagentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that\nare unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug.

One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,\nwhich states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during\nthe course of learning.

In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in\nthis field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)\nbecomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.\nIndeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the\nmiscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To\nevaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically\nconsidered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width\nminimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run\ncoverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during\nthe threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity\nof the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside\nor outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this\npaper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose\nenhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation\n(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance\nof the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent\nabrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction\nintervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that\nthese functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods\nwhile maintaining coverage validity."}

Our analysis suggests that\nan unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and\ndestabilizing training.

The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of\n\\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft\nregularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL\ndivergence.

Yet, even a brief GRPO training\ncan markedly conceal contamination signals that most detection methods rely on.\nFurther empirical experiments and theoretical analysis indicate that PPO style\nimportance sampling and clipping objectives are the root cause of this\ndetection concealment, indicating that a broad class of RL methods may\ninherently exhibit similar concealment capability; (II) when SFT contamination\nwith CoT is applied to advanced LRMs as the final stage, most contamination\ndetection methods perform near random guesses.

This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble\nlearning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade\nand freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A\nnovel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,\nwith egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert\nassessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and\nHaugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply\nmachine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only\nexternal, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding\nlabeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from\nexternal egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and\nweight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature\nextraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,\nDenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,\nSMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning\nalgorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the\nbest-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only\nand tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble\napproach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in\nfreshness prediction.
