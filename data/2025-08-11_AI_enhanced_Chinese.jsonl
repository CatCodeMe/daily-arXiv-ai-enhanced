However, as qualitative and static representations, CLDs are limited\nin their ability to support dynamic analysis and inform intervention\nstrategies. Additionally, quantitative CLD analysis methods like network\ncentrality analysis often lead to false inference. We propose\nDiagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D), a method for converting CLDs into exploratory\nsystem dynamics models (SDMs) in the absence of empirical data. With minimal\nuser input - following a protocol to label variables as stocks,\nflows/auxiliaries, or constants - D2D leverages the structural information\nalready encoded in CLDs, namely, link existence and polarity, to simulate\nhypothetical interventions and explore potential leverage points under\nuncertainty. Results suggest that D2D helps distinguish between high- and\nlow-ranked leverage points. We compare D2D to a data-driven SDM constructed\nfrom the same CLD and variable labeling. D2D showed greater consistency with\nthe data-driven model than network centrality analysis, while providing\nuncertainty estimates and guidance for future data collection. The method is\nimplemented in an open-source Python package and a web-based application to\nsupport further testing and lower the barrier to dynamic modeling for\nresearchers working with CLDs.

However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as\ndatabase intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise.\nInternal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it\neasier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external\nmasqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the\norganization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect\nanomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences\nof operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent\nnormal behavior.

Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based\nmodels to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using\nrole-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data.

Existing methods often struggle with capturing nuanced\ndomain-specific terminology, modeling long-range dependencies, adapting to\ntemporal evolution, and scaling to massive datasets. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel framework that integrates TAPE (Text-Attributed Graph\nRepresentation Enhancement) with Graphormer. Our approach leverages a large\nlanguage model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT, within the TAPE framework to\ngenerate semantically rich explanations from paper content, which are then\nfused into enhanced node representations. These embeddings are combined with\nstructural features using a novel integration layer with learned attention\nweights. Graphormer's path-aware position encoding and multi-head attention\nmechanisms are employed to effectively capture long-range dependencies across\nthe citation network. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on the\nchallenging ogbn-arxiv dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a\nclassification accuracy of 0.772, significantly surpassing the best GCN\nbaseline of 0.713. Our method also yields strong results in precision (0.671),\nrecall (0.577), and F1-score (0.610).

Using historical data of tracked\nconjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation\nstudy on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction\nevents, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average\npropellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy\nthat initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA).

In many practical scenarios, data points come with associated\nweights that reflect their importance, frequency, or confidence. Given a\nweighted point set $P \\subset R^d$, where each point $p \\in P$ has a positive\nweight $w_p$, the goal is to compute a set of $k$ centers $C = \\{ c_1, c_2,\n\\ldots, c_k \\} \\subset R^d$ that minimizes the weighted clustering cost:\n$\\Delta_w(P,C) = \\sum_{p \\in P} w_p \\cdot d(p,C)^2$, where $d(p,C)$ denotes the\nEuclidean distance from $p$ to its nearest center in $C$. Although most\nexisting coreset-based algorithms for $k$-means extend naturally to the\nweighted setting and provide a PTAS, no prior work has offered a simple,\ncoreset-free PTAS designed specifically for the weighted $k$-means problem.\n  In this paper, we present a simple PTAS for weighted $k$-means that does not\nrely on coresets. Building upon the framework of Jaiswal, Kumar, and Sen (2012)\nfor the unweighted case, we extend the result to the weighted setting by using\nthe weighted $D^2$-sampling technique. Our algorithm runs in time $n d \\cdot\n2^{O\\left(\\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon}\\right)}$ and outputs a set of $k$ centers whose\ntotal clustering cost is within a $(1 + \\epsilon)$-factor of the optimal cost.\nAs a key application of the weighted $k$-means, we obtain a PTAS for the sensor\ncoverage problem, which can also be viewed as a continuous locational\noptimization problem.

This study introduces a genetic\nalgorithm-based method for test input generation that innovatively integrates\ngenetic operators and adaptive learning to enhance software vulnerability\ndetection. A key contribution is the application of the crossover operator,\nwhich facilitates exploration by searching across a broader space of potential\ntest inputs.

This strategic integration of exploration\nand exploitation ensures that both diverse and targeted test inputs are\ndeveloped over time.

Decomposition is done by applying machine learning to fit\na dual signal. Machine learning minimizes the loss function which compromises\nbetween fitting the original time series and penalizing irregularities of the\ndual signal. The latter includes terms based on the first and second order\nderivatives along time. To preserve special patterns, weighting of the\nregularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on\nStatistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be\napplied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time\nseries. By isolating noise, the proposed decomposition can be seen as a\ndenoising algorithm. Two approaches of the learning process have been\nconsidered: sequential and jointly. The former approach learns the mean signal\nfirst and then dispersion. The latter approach fits the dual signal jointly.\nJointly learning can uncover complex relationships for the time series with\nheteroskedasticity. Learning has been set by solving the direct non-linear\nunconstrained optimization problem or by applying neural networks that have\nsequential or twin output architectures. Tuning of the loss function\nhyperparameters focuses on the isolated noise to be a stationary stochastic\nprocess without autocorrelation properties. Depending on the applications, the\nhyperparameters of the learning can be tuned towards either the discrete states\nby stepped signal or smoothed series. The decomposed dual signal can be\nrepresented on the 2D space and used to learn inherent structures, to forecast\nboth mean and dispersion, or to analyze cross effects in case of multiple time\nseries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5747\u503c\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u62df\u5408\u53cc\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5747\u503c\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u62df\u5408\u53cc\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u652f\u6301\u987a\u5e8f\u6216\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u6216\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5206\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5982\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

However, the contract\nstate update process can have issues. In particular, inconsistent state update\nissues can arise for reasons such as unsynchronized modifications. Inconsistent\nstate update bugs have been exploited by attackers many times, but existing\ndetection tools still have difficulty in effectively identifying them. This\npaper conducts the first large-scale empirical study about inconsistent state\nupdate vulnerabilities (that is, inconsistent state update bugs that are\nexploitable) in smart contracts, aiming to shed light for developers,\nresearchers, tool builders, and language or library designers in order to avoid\ninconsistent state update vulnerabilities.

We evaluated\nour approach in several environments and showed that semantic reward can guide\nlearning to achieve competitive control behavior, even in the absence of\nhand-crafted reward functions. Our study demonstrates a correlation between the\nlanguage embedding space and the conventional Euclidean space. This framework\nopens new horizons for aligning agent behavior with natural language goals and\nlays the groundwork for a more seamless integration of larger language models\n(LLMs) and fluid control applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SBERT\u8ba1\u7b97\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u96be\u4ee5\u6570\u503c\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SBERT\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f53\u524d\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u624b\u5de5\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u5956\u52b1\u80fd\u6307\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u5de5\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Clinical\ninformation that informs prognostication is collected serially over time.\nShortly after cardiac arrest, various time-invariant baseline features are\ncollected (e.g., demographics, cardiac arrest characteristics). After ICU\nadmission, additional features are gathered, including time-varying hemodynamic\ndata (e.g., blood pressure, doses of vasopressor medications). We view these as\ntwo phases in which we collect new features. In this study, we propose a novel\nstepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the prediction of\nneurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage of\ntime-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase).\nNotably, our model finds patients for whom this second phase (time-varying\nhemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and also when this\ninformation is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data for a patient\nover time, how important these data are for prognostication varies).

In this work, we first identify two main challenges in\nmodeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and\nmeta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of\nsemantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive\nHeterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges.

Traditional multilingual\nmodels, which require simultaneous access to all language data, are impractical\ndue to the sequential arrival of data and privacy constraints. Continual\nLearning (CL) offers a solution by enabling models to learn new languages\nsequentially without catastrophically forgetting previously learned knowledge.\nThis paper investigates CL for ASR on Indian languages using a subset of the\nIndicSUPERB benchmark. We employ a Conformer-based hybrid RNN-T/CTC model,\ninitially pretrained on Hindi, which is then incrementally trained on eight\nadditional Indian languages, for a total sequence of nine languages. We\nevaluate three prominent regularization- and distillation-based CL strategies:\nElastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), and Learning\nwithout Forgetting (LwF), selected for their suitability in no-replay,\nprivacy-conscious scenarios. Performance is analyzed using Word Error Rate\n(WER) for both RNN-T and CTC paths on clean and noisy data, as well as\nknowledge retention via Backward Transfer. We also explore the impact of\nvarying the number of training epochs (1, 2, 5, and 10) per task.

A key algorithmic tool in neuromorphic\ncomputing is spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs are biologically inspired\nneural networks which utilize stateful neurons, and provide low-bit data\nprocessing by encoding and decoding information using spikes. Similar to SNNs,\ndeep state-space models (SSMs) utilize stateful building blocks. However, deep\nSSMs, which recently achieved competitive performance in various temporal\nmodeling tasks, are typically designed with high-precision activation functions\nand no reset mechanisms. To bridge the gains offered by SNNs and the recent\ndeep SSM models, we propose a novel multiple-output spiking neuron model that\ncombines a linear, general SSM state transition with a non-linear feedback\nmechanism through reset. Compared to the existing neuron models for SNNs, our\nproposed model clearly conceptualizes the differences between the spiking\nfunction, the reset condition and the reset action. The experimental results on\nvarious tasks, i.e., a keyword spotting task, an event-based vision task and a\nsequential pattern recognition task, show that our proposed model achieves\nperformance comparable to existing benchmarks in the SNN literature.

The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately\nfabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a\nsignificant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such\ndeception by explicitly setting a \"hidden\" objective through prompting or\nfine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.\nMoving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated\ndeception on benign prompts.

Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we\nfind that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in\nparallel for most models.

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful\nplugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based\noptimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay\nnumber, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the\nrisk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a\nperiodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network\nplasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective,\ncombining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further\nbolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR\nsignificantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods\non both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative\nDPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging\nmath tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based\nalgorithms.

Instead of heavily relying\non the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation\ndirection, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient\nand the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation\ndirection. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of\nResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the\ntransferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current\ninput transformation methods.

As a more\nfeasible alternative, inferring user preferences from massive implicit feedback\nhas shown great potential (e.g., a user quickly skipping a recommended video\nusually indicates disinterest). Unfortunately, implicit feedback is often\nnoisy: a user might skip a video due to accidental clicks or other reasons,\nrather than disliking it. Such noise can easily misjudge user interests,\nthereby undermining recommendation performance. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel Group-aware User Behavior Simulation (G-UBS) paradigm, which\nleverages contextual guidance from relevant user groups, enabling robust and\nin-depth interpretation of implicit feedback for individual users.\nSpecifically, G-UBS operates via two key agents. First, the User Group Manager\n(UGM) effectively clusters users to generate group profiles utilizing a\n``summarize-cluster-reflect\" workflow based on LLMs. Second, the User Feedback\nModeler (UFM) employs an innovative group-aware reinforcement learning\napproach, where each user is guided by the associated group profiles during the\nreinforcement learning process, allowing UFM to robustly and deeply examine the\nreasons behind implicit feedback. To assess our G-UBS paradigm, we have\nconstructed a Video Recommendation benchmark with Implicit Feedback (IF-VR). To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal benchmark for implicit\nfeedback evaluation in video recommendation, encompassing 15k users, 25k\nvideos, and 933k interaction records with implicit feedback.

However,\nthese methods require making forward passes through the underlying model to\nprobe the LLM's knowledge about a specific fact, making them computationally\nexpensive and time-consuming. To bridge this gap, we propose $\\textbf{PEEK}$ or\n$\\textbf{P}$roxy $\\textbf{E}$mbeddings to $\\textbf{E}$stimate\n$\\textbf{K}$nowledge of LLMs, by leveraging the pre-trained embedding models\nthat effectively encode factual knowledge as text or graphs as proxies for\nLLMs. First, we identify a training set of facts known by LLMs through various\nprobing strategies and then adapt embedding models to predict the LLM outputs\nwith a linear decoder layer. Comprehensive evaluation on $3$ Wikipedia-derived\ndatasets, $4$ LLMs, and $7$ embedding models shows that embeddings can predict\nLLM knowledge on a held-out set with up to 90 % accuracy. Furthermore, we find\nthat sentence embedding models are more suitable than graph embeddings to\npredict LLM knowledge, shedding light on the underlying representation of the\nfactual landscape. Thus, we believe that knowledge-adapted embeddings can be\nused to identify knowledge gaps in LLMs at scale and can provide deeper\ninsights into LLMs' internal inductive bias.

However, because short text\nrepresentations have limited expressiveness, conventional methods struggle to\nidentify cluster centers that truly capture each category's underlying\nsemantics, causing the representations to be optimized in suboptimal\ndirections. To address this issue, we propose IOCC, a novel few-shot\ncontrastive learning method that achieves alignment between the cluster centers\nand the semantic centers. IOCC consists of two key modules:\nInteraction-enhanced Optimal Transport (IEOT) and Center-aware Contrastive\nLearning (CACL). Specifically, IEOT incorporates semantic interactions between\nindividual samples into the conventional optimal transport problem, and\ngenerate pseudo-labels. Based on these pseudo-labels, we aggregate\nhigh-confidence samples to construct pseudo-centers that approximate the\nsemantic centers. Next, CACL optimizes text representations toward their\ncorresponding pseudo-centers. As training progresses, the collaboration between\nthe two modules gradually reduces the gap between cluster centers and semantic\ncenters. Therefore, the model will learn a high-quality distribution, improving\nclustering performance. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets show\nthat IOCC outperforms previous methods, achieving up to 7.34\\% improvement on\nchallenging Biomedical dataset and also excelling in clustering stability and\nefficiency.

A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which\nprunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.\nHowever, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,\napplying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and\nstatistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal\ntrade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful\nones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \\textbf{TADrop}\n(\\textbf{T}ensor-wise \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{Drop}), an adaptive\nsparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global\nratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based\non its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with\ndenser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,\nmore critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we\nvalidate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging\nmethods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and\nmultimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and\nsignificantly boosts their performance. For instance, when enhancing a leading\nmerging method, it achieves an average performance gain of 2.0\\% across 8\nViT-B/32 tasks.

In this case, the FI often tends to be\ndistributed among all features which are in correlation with the\nresponse-generating signal features. Even worse, if multiple signal features\nare in strong correlation with a noise feature, while being only modestly\ncorrelated with one another, this can result in a noise feature having a\ndistinctly larger FI score than any signal feature. Here we propose local\nsample weighting (losaw) which can flexibly be integrated into many ML\nalgorithms to improve FI scores in the presence of feature correlation in the\ntraining data. Our approach is motivated from inverse probability weighting in\ncausal inference and locally, within the ML model, uses a sample weighting\nscheme to decorrelate a target feature from the remaining features. This\nreduces model bias locally, whenever the effect of a potential signal feature\nis evaluated and compared to others.

On an independent out-of-distribution benchmark from Maple's\ninternal test suite, our tree transformer model maintains strong\ngeneralisation, outperforming Maple's built-in selector and prior ML\napproaches.\n  These results highlight the critical role of data representation and problem\nframing in ML for symbolic computation, and we expect our methodology to\ngeneralise effectively to similar optimisation problems in mathematical\nsoftware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4ee3\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6811\u57fa\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5148\u7b5b\u9009\u9002\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u518d\u6309\u9884\u6d4b\u8f93\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b\u6570\u5b66\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4ee5\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u57287\u4e07\u4f8b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u8fd190%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eMaple\u5185\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u548c\u5176\u4ed6ML\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u7b26\u53f7\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684ML\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u6570\u5b66\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Prior\nworks showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,\nexhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce\nTRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language\nmodality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates\npseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel\nuncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to\nestimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated\nuncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the\nadverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To\nfurther increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal\nsoft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature\nspaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision\nmodel on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as\nboth a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are\nattracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their\ncaptions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and\nnegative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting.

Land Surface\nTemperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from\nremote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between\nspatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer\npromising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m\nresolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative\nNetwork for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra\nMODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning\nframework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative\nadversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature\nextraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage\nemploys a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from\nthe inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,\nnormalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the\nfused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to\nsuppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy\nbased on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN\ndiscriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods\nin both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the\nbest-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves\nSSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and\neffectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33\nground-based sensors.
