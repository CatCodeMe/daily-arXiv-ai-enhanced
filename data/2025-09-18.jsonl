However,\ndecomposing SLAs is highly challenging due to the heterogeneity of domains,\ndynamic network conditions, and the fact that the SLA orchestrator is oblivious\nto the domain's resource optimization.

Even\nthough earlier attempts focused on caching as the chief solution to tackling\nthis issue, its success was extremely limited. Prefetching has come to be the\nprimary technique in supplementing caching towards soothing the latency problem\nassociated with the contemporary Internet. However, existing approaches in\nprefetching are extremely limited in their ability to employ application level\nweb document relationship which is often visible only to the content developer.\nThis is because most approaches are access history based schemes that make\nfuture users' access prediction only based on past user access. Attempts to\nincorporate prefetching schemes that utilize semantic information with those\nthat use users past access history are extremely limited in their\nextensibility. In this work we present a novel framework that enables\nintegration of schemes from both worlds of prefetching without the need for a\nmajor modification to the algorithms. When there is a need/possibility to\ncapture new application level context, a new algorithm could be developed to do\nso and then it can be integrated into the framework.

Paradoxically,\ntoday's hybrid backbones rely on conventional transport protocols that take\npacket loss to signal network congestion, as opposed to transient environmental\nobstacles. A common approach to address this challenge is to use network coding\n(NC) between the end hosts to recover from these occasional packet loss events.\nHowever, current NC proposals assume full access to the end-hosts' stack to\nperform end-to-end encoding/decoding operations.

Prior work by Livshits, Bertossi, Kimelfeld, and\nSebag (2020) established that this task is #P-hard for every nontrivial\naggregation function when the query is non-hierarchical with respect to its\nexistential variables, assuming the absence of self-joins.

This\nsetting naturally generalizes the study of sublinear-time solvers for symmetric\ndiagonally dominant (SDD) systems [AKP19] to the asymmetric case.\n  Our first contributions are characterizations of the problem's mathematical\nstructure. We express a solution $x^*$ via a Neumann series, prove its\nconvergence, and upper bound the truncation error on this series through a\nnovel quantity of $M$, termed the maximum $p$-norm gap. This quantity\ngeneralizes the spectral gap of symmetric matrices and captures how the\nstructure of $M$ governs the problem's computational difficulty.\n  For systems with bounded maximum $p$-norm gap, we develop a collection of\nalgorithmic results for locally approximating $t^{\\top}x^*$ under various\nscenarios and error measures. We derive these results by adapting the\ntechniques of random-walk sampling, local push, and their bidirectional\ncombination, which have proved powerful for special cases of solving RDD/CDD\nsystems, particularly estimating PageRank and effective resistance on graphs.\nOur general framework yields deeper insights, extended results, and improved\ncomplexity bounds for these problems.

NBTest offers\na library of assertion APIs, and a JupyterLab plugin that enables executing\nassertions. We also develop the first automated approach for generating\ncell-level assertions for key components in ML notebooks, such as data\nprocessing, model building, and model evaluation. NBTest aims to improve the\nreliability and maintainability of ML notebooks without adding developer\nburden.\n  We evaluate NBTest on 592 Kaggle notebooks. Overall, NBTest generates 21163\nassertions (35.75 on average per notebook). The generated assertions obtain a\nmutation score of 0.57 in killing ML-specific mutations. NBTest can catch\nregression bugs in previous versions of the Kaggle notebooks using assertions\ngenerated for the latest versions. Because ML pipelines involve non\ndeterministic computations, the assertions can be flaky. Hence, we also show\nhow NBTest leverages statistical techniques to minimize flakiness while\nretaining high fault-detection effectiveness. NBTest has been adopted in the CI\nof a popular ML library. Further, we perform a user study with 17 participants\nthat shows that notebook users find NBTest intuitive (Rating 4.3/5) and useful\nin writing assertions and testing notebooks (Rating 4.24/5)."}

However, this method frequently discards valuable information, including\nnormal traces that are essential for comparative analysis. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce Trace Sampling 2.0, which operates at the span level\nwhile maintaining trace structure consistency. This approach allows for the\nretention of all traces while significantly reducing storage overhead. Based on\nthis concept, we design and implement Autoscope, a span-level sampling method\nthat leverages static analysis to extract execution logic, ensuring that\ncritical spans are preserved without compromising structural integrity. We\nevaluated Autoscope on two open-source microservices. Our results show that it\nreduces trace size by 81.2% while maintaining 98.1% faulty span coverage,\noutperforming existing trace-level sampling methods. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in root cause analysis, achieving an average\nimprovement of 8.3%.

Prior approaches focus primarily on\nmeasuring faithfulness, while methods for systematically improving it remain\nlimited. We introduce Faithful Reasoning via Intervention Training (FRIT), a\nscalable alignment method that trains models to produce causally consistent\nreasoning by learning from systematically corrupted examples. FRIT generates\nsynthetic training data by intervening on individual reasoning steps in\nmodel-generated CoTs, creating faithful/unfaithful pairs that highlight when\nreasoning breaks down. We then apply Direct Preference Optimization to teach\nmodels to prefer causally consistent reasoning paths. Evaluating on Qwen3-8B\nand Mistral-7B-v0.1 across factual and symbolic reasoning tasks, FRIT increases\nfaithful reasoning by $3.4$ percentage points for Mistral on GSM8K while\nimproving accuracy by $7.6$ percentage points.

However, in the absence of labeled faulty samples for validation and\nthe limited reliability of commonly used metrics, such as validation\nreconstruction error, effective model selection remains a significant\nchallenge. To overcome these limitations, a domain-knowledge-informed approach\nfor model selection is proposed, in which proxy-anomalies engineered through\nstructured perturbations of healthy spectrograms are used in the validation set\nto support model selection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a\nhigh-fidelity electric vehicle dataset comprising healthy and faulty cabin\nsounds across five representative fault types viz., Imbalance, Modulation,\nWhine, Wind, and Pulse Width Modulation. This dataset, generated using advanced\nsound synthesis techniques, and validated via expert jury assessments, has been\nmade publicly available to facilitate further research. Experimental\nevaluations on the five fault cases demonstrate the selection of optimal models\nusing proxy-anomalies, significantly outperform conventional model selection\nstrategies."}

Ablation studies on qubit number and\ncircuit depth reveal trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, and extended\nevaluations confirm robust generation under long diffusion schedules."}

Prior LLM work has focused on\nsupport systems for investors and financial planners. Simultaneously, numerous\nrecent studies examine broader personal finance tasks, including budgeting,\ndebt management, retirement, and estate planning, through agentic pipelines\nthat incur high maintenance costs, yielding less than 25% of their expected\nfinancial returns. In this study, we introduce a novel and reproducible\nframework that integrates relevant financial context with behavioral finance\nstudies to construct supervision data for end-to-end advisors. Using this\nframework, we create a 19k sample reasoning dataset and conduct a comprehensive\nfine-tuning of the Qwen-3-8B model on the dataset. Through a held-out test\nsplit and a blind LLM-jury study, we demonstrate that through careful data\ncuration and behavioral integration, our 8B model achieves performance\ncomparable to significantly larger baselines (14-32B parameters) across factual\naccuracy, fluency, and personalization metrics while incurring 80% lower costs\nthan the larger counterparts."}

Existing theory hypothesizes that\nsecond-order learning -- learning mechanisms that adapt first-order learning\n(i.e., learning about the task/domain) -- promotes the emergence of such\nenvironment-cognition isomorphism. In this paper, we empirically validate this\nhypothesis by proposing a hierarchical architecture comprising a Graph\nConvolutional Network (GCN) as a first-order learner and an MLP controller as a\nsecond-order learner. The GCN directly maps node-level features to predictions\nof optimal navigation paths, while the MLP dynamically adapts the GCN's\nparameters when confronting structurally novel maze environments. We\ndemonstrate that second-order learning is particularly effective when the\ncognitive system develops an internal mental map structurally isomorphic to the\nenvironment. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight significant\nperformance improvements and robust generalization on unseen maze tasks,\nproviding empirical support for the pivotal role of structured mental\nrepresentations in maximizing the effectiveness of second-order learning."}

However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and\nbenchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or\nkeyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise\navoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to\nredundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While\nthis trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like\nlecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and\nrequires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense\nVideo Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by\nreducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are\nalso limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore\npropose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed\nfor dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual\nTokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated\nTokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during\ntokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2)\nSemantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions\nwithin a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics.\nExperiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales\npositively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal\ninformation and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video\nunderstanding."}

The average-reward\nformulation, while natural in many operations research and management contexts,\nremains underexplored. This is primarily because the dynamic programming\nfoundations are technically challenging and only partially understood, with\nseveral fundamental questions remaining open. This paper steps toward a general\nframework for average-reward robust MDPs by analyzing the constant-gain\nsetting. We study the average-reward robust control problem with possible\ninformation asymmetries between the controller and an S-rectangular adversary.\nOur analysis centers on the constant-gain robust Bellman equation, examining\nboth the existence of solutions and their relationship to the optimal average\nreward. Specifically, we identify when solutions to the robust Bellman equation\ncharacterize the optimal average reward and stationary policies, and we provide\nsufficient conditions ensuring solutions' existence.

The flow dynamics can be time-varying\nand chaotic, resulting in sporadic and intermittent sensor readings, and\ncomplex environmental geometries further complicate a team's ability to model\nand predict the dispersion. To accurately account for the physical processes\nthat drive the dispersion dynamics, robots must have access to computationally\nintensive numerical models, which can be difficult when onboard computation is\nlimited. We present a distributed mobile sensing framework for source\nlocalization in which each robot carries a machine-learned, finite element\nmodel of its environment to guide information-based sampling. The models are\nused to evaluate an approximate mutual information criterion to drive an\ninfotaxis control strategy, which selects sensing regions that are expected to\nmaximize informativeness for the source localization objective. Our approach\nachieves faster error reduction compared to baseline sensing strategies and\nresults in more accurate source localization compared to baseline machine\nlearning approaches."}

Based on the analysis of the\nsolution path of the fused lasso using a LARS-type algorithm, we derive exact\nconditional $p$-values for the selected change-points.
