A broad class of such tasks involves a semantic join-joining two tables based on a natural language predicate per pair of tuples, evaluated using an LLM. Semantic joins generalize tasks such as entity matching and record categorization, as well as more complex text understanding tasks. A naive implementation is expensive as it requires invoking an LLM for every pair of rows in the cross product. Existing approaches mitigate this cost by first applying embedding-based semantic similarity to filter candidate pairs, deferring to an LLM only when similarity scores are deemed inconclusive. However, these methods yield limited gains in practice, since semantic similarity may not reliably predict the join outcome. We propose Featurized-Decomposition Join (FDJ for short), a novel approach for performing semantic joins that significantly reduces cost while preserving quality. FDJ automatically extracts features and combines them into a logical expression in conjunctive normal form that we call a featurized decomposition to effectively prune out non-matching pairs. A featurized decomposition extracts key information from text records and performs inexpensive comparisons on the extracted features. We show how to use LLMs to automatically extract reliable features and compose them into logical expressions while providing statistical guarantees on the output result-an inherently challenging problem due to dependencies among features. Experiments on real-world datasets show up to 10 times reduction in cost compared with the state-of-the-art while providing the same quality guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFeaturized-Decomposition Join (FDJ)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe10\u500d", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5b9e\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u3001\u8bb0\u5f55\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u5bf9\u5143\u7ec4\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8c13\u8bcd\uff0c\u6734\u7d20\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u6781\u9ad8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u8fde\u63a5\u7ed3\u679c", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFDJ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u5408\u53d6\u8303\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff08\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u5206\u89e3\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ec9\u4ef7\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6bd4\u8f83\u6709\u6548\u526a\u9664\u975e\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u3002\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u9760\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe10\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1", "conclusion": "FDJ\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, a subclass of the temporal graph, i.e., Property Evolution Temporal Graph, in which the value of properties on nodes or edges changes frequently while the graph's topology barely changes, is growing rapidly. However, existing temporal graph management solutions are not oriented to the Property Evolution Temporal Graph data, which leads to highly complex data modeling and low-performance query processing of temporal graph queries. To solve these problems, we developed PETGraph, a data management system for Property Evolution Temporal Graph data. PETGraph adopts a valid-time temporal property graph data model to facilitate data modeling, supporting ACID features with transactions. To improve temporal graph query performance, we designed a space-efficient temporal property storage and a fine-granularity multi-level locking mechanism. Experimental results show that PETGraph requires, on average, only 33% of the storage space needed by the current best data management solution. Additionally, it achieves an average of 58.8 times higher transaction throughput in HTAP workloads compared to the best current solutions and outperforms them by an average of 267 times in query latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "PETGraph\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u5e8f\u56fe\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u8282\u770167%\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u534758.8\u500d\u4e8b\u52a1\u541e\u5410\u548c267\u500d\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5c5e\u6027\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u5e8f\u56fe\uff08\u8282\u70b9/\u8fb9\u5c5e\u6027\u9891\u7e41\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53d8\uff09\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u5e8f\u56fe\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u6548\u65f6\u95f4\u65f6\u5e8f\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u652f\u6301ACID\u4e8b\u52a1\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5c5e\u6027\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u591a\u7ea7\u9501\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "PETGraph\u5e73\u5747\u53ea\u9700\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u684833%\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5728HTAP\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u574758.8\u500d\u7684\u4e8b\u52a1\u541e\u5410\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u67e5\u8be2\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6848\u5feb267\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "PETGraph\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u5c5e\u6027\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u5e8f\u56fe\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Previously, Shaw and Yu showed that optimal linear-gap cost chaining can produce a chain with $1 - O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}}\\right)$ recoverability, the proportion of the mutation history that is recovered, in $O\\left(mn^{2.43\u03b8} \\log n\\right)$ expected time, where $\u03b8< 0.206$ is the mutation rate under a substitution-only channel and $s_1$ is assumed to be uniformly random. However, a gap remains between theory and practice, since real genomic data includes insertions and deletions (indels), and yet seed-chain-extend remains effective. In this paper, we generalize those prior results by introducing mathematical machinery to deal with the two new obstacles introduced by indel channels: the dependence of neighboring anchors and the presence of anchors that are only partially correct. We are thus able\n  to prove that the expected recoverability of an optimal chain is $\\ge 1 - O\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}}\\Bigr)$ and the expected runtime is $O(mn^{3.15 \\cdot \u03b8_T}\\log n)$, when the total mutation rate given by the sum of the substitution, insertion, and deletion mutation rates ($\u03b8_T = \u03b8_i + \u03b8_d + \u03b8_s$) is less than $0.159$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u79cd\u5b50\u94fe\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5305\u542b\u63d2\u5165\u548c\u5220\u9664\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u603b\u7a81\u53d8\u7387\u5c0f\u4e8e0.159\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u94fe\u7684\u671f\u671b\u6062\u590d\u7387\u81f3\u5c11\u4e3a1-O(1/\u221am)\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3aO(mn^{3.15\u03b8_T} log n)\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ec5\u5305\u542b\u66ff\u6362\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u5305\u542b\u63d2\u5165\u548c\u5220\u9664(indels)\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406indels\u901a\u9053\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u79cd\u5b50\u94fe\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5904\u7406indels\u901a\u9053\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u969c\u788d\uff1a\u76f8\u90bb\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u6b63\u786e\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5305\u542b\u66ff\u6362\u3001\u63d2\u5165\u548c\u5220\u9664\u7684\u603b\u7a81\u53d8\u901a\u9053\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u7ebf\u6027\u95f4\u9699\u6210\u672c\u94fe\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u603b\u7a81\u53d8\u7387\u03b8_T = \u03b8_i + \u03b8_d + \u03b8_s < 0.159\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u94fe\u7684\u671f\u671b\u6062\u590d\u7387\u81f3\u5c11\u4e3a1-O(1/\u221am)\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3aO(mn^{3.15\u03b8_T} log n)\u3002\u8fd9\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66ff\u6362\u901a\u9053\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u79cd\u5b50\u94fe\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5305\u542bindels\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8be5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

These include computational constraints, the limitations of single-view learning algorithms and the complexity of processing large datasets from different domains, sources or views. In this context, multi-view clustering (MVC), a class of unsupervised multi-view learning, emerges as a powerful approach to overcome these challenges. MVC compensates for the shortcomings of single-view methods and provides a richer data representation and effective solutions for a variety of unsupervised learning tasks. In contrast to traditional single-view approaches, the semantically rich nature of multi-view data increases its practical utility despite its inherent complexity. This survey makes a threefold contribution: (1) a systematic categorization of multi-view clustering methods into well-defined groups, including co-training, co-regularization, subspace, deep learning, kernel-based, anchor-based, and graph-based strategies; (2) an in-depth analysis of their respective strengths, weaknesses, and practical challenges, such as scalability and incomplete data; and (3) a forward-looking discussion of emerging trends, interdisciplinary applications, and future directions in MVC research. This study represents an extensive workload, encompassing the review of over 140 foundational and recent publications, the development of comparative insights on integration strategies such as early fusion, late fusion, and joint learning, and the structured investigation of practical use cases in the areas of healthcare, multimedia, and social network analysis. By integrating these efforts, this work aims to fill existing gaps in MVC research and provide actionable insights for the advancement of the field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u4e3a\u4e03\u7c7b\u4e3b\u8981\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6e90\u5927\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5f25\u8865\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u534f\u540c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u951a\u70b9\u6cd5\u548c\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e03\u7c7b\uff1b2) \u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u5404\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6311\u6218\uff1b3) \u6574\u5408\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7140\u7bc7\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u6700\u65b0\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u878d\u5408\u3001\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\u548c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6982\u89c8\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u5404\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\uff08\u533b\u7597\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u3001\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\uff09\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u5177\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u663e\u8457\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u5305\u62ec\u65b0\u5174\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u3002"}}

To this end, we make a first attempt to formally model and analyze the problem of service provisioning for MM sessions in 5G/6G networks. We first formalize service and network graph models for the MM, using \"live audience interaction in a virtual concert\" as a reference scenario.

While rule-based methods rely on separation logic rules (lemmas) for automation, these rule statements are insufficient for describing automation strategies, which usually involve the alignment and elimination of corresponding memory layouts in specific scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Stellis, a strategy language for purifying separation logic entailments, i.e., removing all spatial formulas to reduce the entailment to a simpler pure entailment. Stellis features a powerful matching mechanism and a flexible action description, enabling the straightforward encoding of a wide range of strategies. To ensure strategy soundness, we introduce an algorithm that generates a soundness condition for each strategy, thereby reducing the soundness of each strategy to the correctness of its soundness condition. Furthermore, based on a mechanized reduction soundness theorem, our prototype implementation generates correctness proofs for the overall automation. We evaluate our system on a benchmark of 229 entailments collected from verification of standard linked data structures and the memory module of a microkernel, and the evaluation results demonstrate that, with such flexibility and convenience provided, our system is also highly effective, which automatically purifies 95.6% (219 out of 229) of the entailments using 5 libraries with 98 strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Stellis\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7eaf\u5316\u5206\u79bb\u903b\u8f91\u8574\u542b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u9664\u7a7a\u95f4\u516c\u5f0f\u5c06\u8574\u542b\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u7eaf\u8574\u542b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc1\u660e\u5206\u79bb\u903b\u8f91\u8574\u542b\u662f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u79bb\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c4\u5219\u8bed\u53e5\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u63cf\u8ff0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u76f8\u5e94\u5185\u5b58\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStellis\u7b56\u7565\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u5404\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u68b0\u5316\u7684\u5f52\u7ea6\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u539f\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u6574\u4f53\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b229\u4e2a\u8574\u542b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff08\u6765\u81ea\u6807\u51c6\u94fe\u8868\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5fae\u5185\u6838\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u75285\u4e2a\u5e93\u548c98\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u7eaf\u5316\u4e8695.6%\uff08219\u4e2a\uff09\u7684\u8574\u542b\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Stellis\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u65b9\u4fbf\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7eaf\u5316\u5206\u79bb\u903b\u8f91\u8574\u542b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget.

However, existing approaches typically rely on uniform random masking, implicitly assuming all features are equally predictable. In reality, laboratory tests exhibit substantial heterogeneity in volatility: some biomarkers (e.g., sodium) remain stable, while others (e.g., lactate) fluctuate considerably and are more difficult to model. Clinically, volatile biomarkers often signal acute pathophysiology and require more sophisticated modeling to capture their complex temporal patterns. We propose a volatility-aware pretraining strategy, Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV-Masking), that adaptively adjusts masking probabilities according to the intrinsic variability of each feature. Combined with a value-only masking objective aligned with clinical workflows, CV-Masking yields systematic improvements over random and variance-based strategies. Experiments on a large panel of laboratory tests show that CV-Masking enhances reconstruction, improves downstream predictive performance, and accelerates convergence, producing more robust and clinically meaningful EHR representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCV-Masking\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u63a9\u7801\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MAE\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u5177\u6709\u540c\u7b49\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6307\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff1a\u6709\u4e9b\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff08\u5982\u94a0\uff09\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u6709\u4e9b\uff08\u5982\u4e73\u9178\uff09\u6ce2\u52a8\u5927\u4e14\u66f4\u96be\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0a\uff0c\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u5927\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u5e38\u63d0\u793a\u6025\u6027\u75c5\u7406\u751f\u7406\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u6765\u6355\u6349\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565CV-Masking\uff08\u53d8\u5f02\u7cfb\u6570\u63a9\u7801\uff09\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5185\u5728\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u63a9\u7801\u6982\u7387\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4ec5\u503c\u63a9\u7801\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9762\u677f\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCV-Masking\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u91cd\u6784\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u7684EHR\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "CV-Masking\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recently, VNE with Alternative topologies (VNEAP) was introduced to capture malleable VNRs, where each request can be instantiated using one of several functionally equivalent topologies that trade resources differently. While this flexibility enlarges the feasible space, it also introduces an additional decision layer, making dynamic embedding more challenging. This paper proposes HRL-VNEAP, a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach for VNEAP under dynamic arrivals. A high-level policy selects the most suitable alternative topology (or rejects the request), and a low-level policy embeds the chosen topology onto the substrate network. Experiments on realistic substrate topologies under multiple traffic loads show that naive exploitation strategies provide only modest gains, whereas HRL-VNEAP consistently achieves the best performance across all metrics. Compared to the strongest tested baselines, HRL-VNEAP improves acceptance ratio by up to \\textbf{20.7\\%}, total revenue by up to \\textbf{36.2\\%}, and revenue-over-cost by up to \\textbf{22.1\\%}.

Most often, LLMs are designed as \"general purpose\" technologies meant to represent the general population. Unfortunately, this often means alignment with predominantly Western Caucasian narratives and misalignment with other cultures and populations that engage in collaborative innovation. In response to this misalignment, there have been recent efforts centered on the development of \"culturally-informed\" LLMs, such as ChatBlackGPT, that are capable of better aligning with historically marginalized experiences and perspectives. Despite this progress, there has been little effort aimed at supporting our ability to develop and evaluate culturally-informed LLMs. A recent effort proposed an approach for developing a national alignment benchmark that emphasizes alignment with national social values and common knowledge. However, given the range of cultural identities present in the United States (U.S.), a national alignment benchmark is an ineffective goal for broader representation. To help fill this gap in this US context, we propose a replication study that translates the process used to develop KorNAT, a Korean National LLM alignment benchmark, to develop CIVIQ, a Cultural Intelligence and Values Inference Quality benchmark centered on alignment with community social values and common knowledge.

Code: https://github.com/zihaowu25/InvarDiff", "summary": "Diffusion models deliver high-fidelity synthesis but remain slow due to iterative sampling. We empirically observe there exists feature invariance in deterministic sampling, and present InvarDiff, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the relative temporal invariance across timestep-scale and layer-scale. From a few deterministic runs, we compute a per-timestep, per-layer, per-module binary cache plan matrix and use a re-sampling correction to avoid drift when consecutive caches occur. Using quantile-based change metrics, this matrix specifies which module at which step is reused rather than recomputed. The same invariance criterion is applied at the step scale to enable cross-timestep caching, deciding whether an entire step can reuse cached results. During inference, InvarDiff performs step-first and layer-wise caching guided by this matrix. When applied to DiT and FLUX, our approach reduces redundant compute while preserving fidelity. Experiments show that InvarDiff achieves $2$-$3\\times$ end-to-end speed-ups with minimal impact on standard quality metrics.

We present a systematic evaluation of tokenization approaches for clinical time series modeling using transformer-based architectures, revealing task-dependent and sometimes counterintuitive findings about temporal and value feature importance. Through controlled ablations across four clinical prediction tasks on MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that explicit time encodings provide no consistent statistically significant benefit for the evaluated downstream tasks. Value features show task-dependent importance, affecting mortality prediction but not readmission, suggesting code sequences alone can carry sufficient predictive signal. We further show that frozen pretrained code encoders dramatically outperform their trainable counterparts while requiring dramatically fewer parameters. Larger clinical encoders provide consistent improvements across tasks, benefiting from frozen embeddings that eliminate computational overhead. Our controlled evaluation enables fairer tokenization comparisons and demonstrates that simpler, parameter-efficient approaches can, in many cases, achieve strong performance, though the optimal tokenization strategy remains task-dependent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u76ca\u5904\uff0c\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u51bb\u7ed3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f18\u4e8e\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7248\u672c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5728MIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u76ca\u5904\uff1b\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u800c\u5f02\uff08\u5f71\u54cd\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4f46\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u518d\u5165\u9662\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\uff1b\u51bb\u7ed3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7248\u672c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\uff1b\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\u4ecd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002"}}

It integrates new breeds of tools and advanced technologies to enable zero-touch management of an edge-cloud continuum, building on top of the 3GPP Edge Enablement Layer and the respective connectivity models, allowing to cater to the high flexibility, availability, efficiency, reliability, and resilience needs of the future 6G services and applications.

However, there are also quality concerns regarding the AI-generated code. The generated code is produced by models trained on publicly available code, which are known to contain bugs and quality issues. Those issues can cause trust and maintenance challenges during the development process. Several quality issues associated with AI-generated code have been reported, including bugs and defects. However, these findings are often scattered and lack a systematic summary. A comprehensive review is currently lacking to reveal the types and distribution of these errors, possible remediation strategies, as well as their correlation with the specific models. In this paper, we systematically analyze the existing AI-generated code literature to establish an overall understanding of bugs and defects in generated code, providing a reference for future model improvement and quality assessment. We aim to understand the nature and extent of bugs in AI-generated code, and provide a classification of bug types and patterns present in code generated by different models. We also discuss possible fixes and mitigation strategies adopted to eliminate bugs from the generated code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003", "motivation": "AI\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5b58\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5168\u9762\u7efc\u8ff0\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u4fee\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7f3a\u9677\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210"}}

It has found applications across various fields, including network centrality, graph clustering, and machine learning. These applications typically require efficient evaluation of pairwise biharmonic distances. However, existing algorithms remain computationally expensive. The state-of-the-art method attains an absolute-error guarantee epsilon_abs with time complexity O(L^5 / epsilon_abs^2), where L denotes the truncation length. In this work, we improve the complexity to O(L^3 / epsilon^2) under a relative-error guarantee epsilon via probe-driven random walks. We provide a relative-error guarantee rather than an absolute-error guarantee because biharmonic distances vary by orders of magnitude across node pairs. Since L is often very large in real-world networks (for example, L >= 10^3), reducing the L-dependence from the fifth to the third power yields substantial gains.

Yet these systems lack static guarantees about message protocols: processes communicate by sending arbitrary messages that pattern-matched at runtime, deferring protocol violations to production failures.\n  We present NVLang, a statically typed functional language that brings comprehensive type safety to the BEAM virtual machine while preserving actor model's simplicity and power. NVLang's central contribution that algebraic data types (ADTs) naturally encode actor message protocols: each actor declares the sum type representing its message vocabulary, and the type system enforces protocol conformance at compile time. We introduce typed process identifiers (Pid[T]) that encode the protocol an actor expects, and typed futures (Future[T]) that provide type-safe request-reply patterns.\n  By extending Hindley-Milner type inference to track message protocols, NVLang eliminates an entire class of message-passing errors while maintaining clean syntax that rivals dynamically typed alternatives. Our implementation compiles to Core Erlang, enabling seamless interoperability with the existing Erlang ecosystem.

As a result, genomic data vastly outpace available phenotypic labels, limiting the effectiveness of traditional supervised models. We hypothesize that combining pre-trained Protein Language Models (PLMs) with Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) can retain high predictive accuracy even when labeled data are scarce. We evaluated two SSL strategies, Self-training and Label Spreading, against fully supervised baselines using four PLM-derived embeddings (ESM-2, ProtVec, ProtT5, ProtBert) applied to haemagglutinin (HA) sequences. A nested cross-validation framework simulated low-label regimes (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% label availability) across four IAV subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H9N2). SSL consistently improved performance under label scarcity. Self-training with ProtVec produced the largest relative gains, showing that SSL can compensate for lower-resolution representations. ESM-2 remained highly robust, achieving F1 scores above 0.82 with only 25% labeled data, indicating that its embeddings capture key antigenic determinants. While H1N1 and H9N2 were predicted with high accuracy, the hypervariable H3N2 subtype remained challenging, although SSL mitigated the performance decline. These findings demonstrate that integrating PLMs with SSL can address the antigenicity labeling bottleneck and enable more effective use of unlabeled surveillance sequences, supporting rapid variant prioritization and timely vaccine strain selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6297\u539f\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6d41\u611f\u75c5\u6bd2\u6297\u539f\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d41\u611fA\u75c5\u6bd2\u6297\u539f\u6027\u5feb\u901f\u8fdb\u5316\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u66f4\u65b0\u75ab\u82d7\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8840\u51dd\u6291\u5236\u8bd5\u9a8c\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u8fdc\u591a\u4e8e\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u8868\u578b\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cd\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u4f20\u64ad\uff09\uff0c\u4e0e\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u79cdPLM\u884d\u751f\u5d4c\u5165\uff08ESM-2\u3001ProtVec\u3001ProtT5\u3001ProtBert\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8840\u51dd\u7d20\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5d4c\u5957\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u6a21\u62df\u4f4e\u6807\u7b7e\u573a\u666f\uff0825%\u300150%\u300175%\u3001100%\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u56db\u79cdIAV\u4e9a\u578b\uff08H1N1\u3001H3N2\u3001H5N1\u3001H9N2\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0eProtVec\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u5927\u76f8\u5bf9\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u8868\u660eSSL\u53ef\u8865\u507f\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8868\u793a\u3002ESM-2\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4ec5\u752825%\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230F1\u5206\u65700.82\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002H1N1\u548cH9N2\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u53d8\u7684H3N2\u4e9a\u578b\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4f46SSL\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6574\u5408\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u6297\u539f\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5f02\u4f53\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u53ca\u65f6\u75ab\u82d7\u682a\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

Consequently, software engineering education must adapt to ensure that students not only learn traditional development methods but also understand how to meaningfully and responsibly use these new technologies. In particular, project-based courses offer an effective environment to explore and evaluate the integration of AI assistance into real-world development practices. This paper presents our approach and a user study conducted within a university programming project in which students collaboratively developed computer games. The study investigates how participants used generative AI tools throughout different phases of the software development process, identifies the types of tasks where such tools were most effective, and analyzes the challenges students encountered. Building on these insights, we further examine a repository-aware, locally deployed large language model (LLM) assistant designed to provide project-contextualized support. The system employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground responses in relevant documentation and source code, enabling qualitative analysis of model behavior, parameter sensitivity, and common failure modes. The findings deepen our understanding of context-aware AI support in educational software projects and inform future integration of AI-based assistance into software engineering curricula.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6559\u80b2\u9879\u76ee\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u5f00\u53d1\u9879\u76ee\u5206\u6790\u5b66\u751f\u4f7f\u7528AI\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eRAG\u7684\u672c\u5730LLM\u52a9\u624b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u6b63\u5728\u6539\u53d8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6559\u80b2\u9700\u8981\u9002\u5e94\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u751f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b66\u4e60\u4f20\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u4e14\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5927\u5b66\u7f16\u7a0b\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u5f00\u5c55\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u534f\u4f5c\u5f00\u53d1\u7535\u8111\u6e38\u620f\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7684\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u652f\u6301\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684AI\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u5e38\u89c1\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5AI\u652f\u6301\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5c06AI\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bfe\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8bbe\u8ba1AI\u652f\u6301\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6559\u80b2\u3002"}}

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to address this by minimising domain discrepancy during training, but the discrepancy estimates suffer from high variance in stochastic settings, which can stifle the theoretical benefits of the method. This paper proposes Variance-Reduced Domain Adaptation via Stratified Sampling (VaRDASS), the first specialised stochastic variance reduction technique for UDA. We consider two specific discrepancy measures -- correlation alignment and the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) -- and derive ad hoc stratification objectives for these terms. We then present expected and worst-case error bounds, and prove that our proposed objective for the MMD is theoretically optimal (i.e., minimises the variance) under certain assumptions. Finally, a practical k-means style optimisation algorithm is introduced and analysed. Experiments on three domain shift datasets demonstrate improved discrepancy estimation accuracy and target domain performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVaRDASS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u91c7\u6837\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff08UDA\uff09\u5728\u968f\u673a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u963b\u788d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u6280\u672f", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVaRDASS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6700\u5927\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\uff08MMD\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5206\u5c42\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165k-means\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5dee\u5f02\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86MMD\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6027", "conclusion": "VaRDASS\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9UDA\u7684\u968f\u673a\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u91c7\u6837\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd"}}

We report a two-phase qualitative study with 20 software engineers to understand this. In Phase I, participants exchanged peer reviews and were interviewed about their affective responses and engagement decisions. In Phase II, we introduced a new prompt matching engineers' preferences and probed how characteristics shaped their reactions. We develop an integrative account linking emotional self-regulation to behavioral engagement and resolution. We identify self-regulation strategies that engineers use to regulate their emotions in response to negative feedback: reframing, dialogic regulation, avoidance, and defensiveness. Engagement proceeds through social calibration; engineers align their responses and behaviors to the relational climate and team norms. Trajectories to resolution, in the case of peer-led review, vary by locus (solo/dyad/team) and an internal sense-making process. With the LLM-assisted review, emotional costs and the need for self-regulation seem lower. When LLM feedback aligned with engineers' cognitive expectations, participants reported reduced processing effort and a potentially higher tendency to adopt. We show that LLM-assisted review redirects engagement from emotion management to cognitive load management. We contribute an integrative model of engagement that links emotional self-regulation to behavioral engagement and resolution, showing how affective and cognitive processes influence feedback adoption in peer-led and LLM-assisted code reviews. We conclude that AI is best positioned as a supportive partner to reduce cognitive and emotional load while preserving human accountability and the social meaning of peer review and similar socio-technical activities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5728LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u540c\u884c\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u53cd\u5e94\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5ba1\u67e5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u6210\u672c\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5c06\u53c2\u4e0e\u91cd\u70b9\u4ece\u60c5\u7eea\u7ba1\u7406\u8f6c\u5411\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4f46\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5728LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u540c\u884c\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u5f0f\u5dee\u5f02\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u5ba1\u67e5\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u53cd\u5e94\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c20\u540d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u8fdb\u884c\u540c\u884c\u5ba1\u67e5\u5e76\u63a5\u53d7\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u60c5\u611f\u53cd\u5e94\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7b26\u5408\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u504f\u597d\u7684\u65b0\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5e94\u5bf9\u8d1f\u9762\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8c03\u8282\u3001\u56de\u907f\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u6027\u3002\u53c2\u4e0e\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4f1a\u6821\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u6839\u636e\u5173\u7cfb\u6c1b\u56f4\u548c\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u8303\u8c03\u6574\u53cd\u5e94\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5728\u540c\u884c\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8f68\u8ff9\u56e0\u7126\u70b9\uff08\u4e2a\u4eba/\u4e8c\u4eba/\u56e2\u961f\uff09\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u610f\u4e49\u5efa\u6784\u8fc7\u7a0b\u800c\u5f02\u3002LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5ba1\u67e5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u6210\u672c\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5f53LLM\u53cd\u9988\u7b26\u5408\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u8ba4\u77e5\u671f\u671b\u65f6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u52aa\u529b\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91c7\u7eb3\u503e\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5ba1\u67e5\u5c06\u53c2\u4e0e\u91cd\u70b9\u4ece\u60c5\u7eea\u7ba1\u7406\u8f6c\u5411\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u7ba1\u7406\u3002AI\u6700\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u6027\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8d1f\u8377\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4eba\u7c7b\u8d23\u4efb\u548c\u540c\u884c\u5ba1\u67e5\u7b49\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u5408\u53c2\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u540c\u884c\u548cLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u91c7\u7eb3\u3002"}}

Reduced-precision (below IEEE accuracy) is an established tool to address bandwidth constraints, although it remains unclear whether AoS and precision conversions should execute on a CPU or be deployed to a GPU if the compute kernel itself must run on an accelerator. On modern superchips where CPUs and GPUs share (logically) one data space, it is also unclear whether it is advantageous to stream data to the accelerator prior to the calculation, or whether we should let the accelerator transform data on demand, i.e.~work in-place logically. We therefore introduce compiler annotations to facilitate such conversions and to give the programmer the option to orchestrate the conversions in combination with GPU offloading. For some of our compute kernels of interest, Nvidia's G200 platforms yield a speedup of around 2.6 while AMD's MI300A exhibits more robust performance yet profits less.

We report on the industrial deployment of WhatsCode, a domain-specific AI development system that supports WhatsApp (serving over 2 billion users) and processes millions of lines of code across multiple platforms. Over 25 months (2023-2025), WhatsCode evolved from targeted privacy automation to autonomous agentic workflows integrated with end-to-end feature development and DevOps processes.\n  WhatsCode achieved substantial quantifiable impact, improving automated privacy verification coverage 3.5x from 15% to 53%, identifying privacy requirements, and generating over 3,000 accepted code changes with acceptance rates ranging from 9% to 100% across different automation domains. The system committed 692 automated refactor/fix changes, 711 framework adoptions, 141 feature development assists and maintained 86% precision in bug triage. Our study identifies two stable human-AI collaboration patterns that emerged from production deployment: one-click rollout for high-confidence changes (60% of cases) and commandeer-revise for complex decisions (40%). We demonstrate that organizational factors, such as ownership models, adoption dynamics, and risk management, are as decisive as technical capabilities for enterprise-scale AI success.

However, optimizing scheduling for serverless functions remains challenging due to their dynamic and event-driven nature. While data locality has been proven effective in traditional cluster computing systems through delay scheduling, its application in serverless platforms remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing delay scheduling methods in serverless environments and identify three key observations: 1) delay scheduling benefits vary significantly based on function input characteristics; 2) serverless computing exhibits more complex locality patterns than cluster computing systems, encompassing both data locality and infrastructure locality; and 3) heterogeneous function execution times make rule-based delay thresholds ineffective. Based on these insights, we propose Metronome, a differentiated delay scheduling framework that employs predictive mechanisms to identify optimal locality-aware nodes for individual functions. Metronome leverages an online Random Forest Regression model to forecast function execution times across various nodes, enabling informed delay decisions while preventing SLA violations. Our implementation on OpenLambda shows that Metronome significantly outperforms baselines, achieving 64.88%-95.83% reduction in mean execution time for functions, while maintaining performance advantages under increased concurrency levels and ensuring SLA compliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Metronome\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5730\u6027\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u51fd\u6570\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4", "motivation": "\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08FaaS\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u7fa4\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5730\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8c03\u5ea6\uff09\u5728\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u51fd\u6570\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u672c\u5730\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u66f4\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9608\u503c\u65e0\u6548", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMetronome\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5730\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u672c\u5730\u6027\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u7684\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u505a\u51fa\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u9632\u6b62SLA\u8fdd\u89c4", "result": "\u5728OpenLambda\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u793a\uff0cMetronome\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u51fd\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1164.88%-95.83%\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fddSLA\u5408\u89c4", "conclusion": "Metronome\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8c03\u5ea6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5730\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u51fd\u6570\u5373\u670d\u52a1\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Similar to the propagation-aggregation methodology, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) algorithm tests isomorphism through color refinement according to color representations of a node and its neighbor nodes. However, 1-WL does not leverage any edge features (labels), presenting a potential improvement on exploiting edge features in some fields. To address this limitation, we proposed a novel Edged-WL algorithm (E-WL) which extends the original 1-WL algorithm to incorporate edge features. Building upon the E-WL algorithm, we also introduce an Edged Graph Isomorphism Network (EGIN) model for further exploiting edge features, which addresses one key drawback in many GNNs that do not utilize any edge features of graph data. We evaluated the performance of proposed models using 12 edge-featured benchmark graph datasets and compared them with some state-of-the-art baseline models. Experimental results indicate that our proposed EGIN models, in general, demonstrate superior performance in graph learning on graph classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faE-WL\u7b97\u6cd5\u6269\u5c551-WL\u4ee5\u7eb3\u5165\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efaEGIN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u572812\u4e2a\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfGNN\u7684\u4f20\u64ad-\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e1-WL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f461-WL\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u8bb8\u591aGNN\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faE-WL\u7b97\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u539f\u59cb1-WL\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u7eb3\u5165\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efaEGIN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5229\u7528\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u51c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cEGIN\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u5f62\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "E-WL\u7b97\u6cd5\u548cEGIN\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e861-WL\u548c\u8bb8\u591aGNN\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The overarching design unfolds across three stages, scoping through literature review, deriving personas and analytic processes, and applying the method in collaborative workshops.

Howard", "Panos Stinis"], "title": "Bridging quantum and classical computing for partial differential equations through multifidelity machine learning", "categories": ["cs.LG", "quant-ph"], "comment": "19 pages, 12 figures", "summary": "Quantum algorithms for partial differential equations (PDEs) face severe practical constraints on near-term hardware: limited qubit counts restrict spatial resolution to coarse grids, while circuit depth limitations prevent accurate long-time integration. These hardware bottlenecks confine quantum PDE solvers to low-fidelity regimes despite their theoretical potential for computational speedup. We introduce a multifidelity learning framework that corrects coarse quantum solutions to high-fidelity accuracy using sparse classical training data, facilitating the path toward practical quantum utility for scientific computing. The approach trains a low-fidelity surrogate on abundant quantum solver outputs, then learns correction mappings through a multifidelity neural architecture that balances linear and nonlinear transformations. Demonstrated on benchmark nonlinear PDEs including viscous Burgers equation and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows via quantum lattice Boltzmann methods, the framework successfully corrects coarse quantum predictions and achieves temporal extrapolation well beyond the classical training window. This strategy illustrates how one can reduce expensive high-fidelity simulation requirements while producing predictions that are competitive with classical accuracy. By bridging the gap between hardware-limited quantum simulations and application requirements, this work establishes a pathway for extracting computational value from current quantum devices in real-world scientific applications, advancing both algorithm development and practical deployment of near-term quantum computing for computational physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u89e3\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u7ecf\u5178\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6821\u6b63\u5230\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50PDE\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u9762\u4e34\u8fd1\u7aef\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\u9650\u5236\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ea\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42", "method": "\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u89e3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u6821\u6b63\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u7ecf\u5178\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3", "result": "\u5728\u7c98\u6027Burgers\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u538b\u7f29Navier-Stokes\u6d41\u52a8\u7b49\u975e\u7ebf\u6027PDE\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u6821\u6b63\u7c97\u91cf\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u51fa\u7ecf\u5178\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5916\u63a8\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53ef\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u67b6\u8d77\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u5f53\u524d\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ef7\u503c\u5efa\u7acb\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u8fd1\u7aef\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72"}}

Through a comparative analysis of influence functions across language and vision tasks, we identify subsets of training data with negligible impact on model outputs.

While mainframes are generally dependable, they can be difficult to maintain due to their high maintenance costs, the shortage of skills, and the problems in integrating them with cloud-based systems. By adopting AI-driven modernization strategies such as automated code refactoring, migration of data using smart tools, and predictive maintenance, companies can easily move to microservices, containerized environments, and hybrid cloud platforms. Machine learning models have the capability to go through legacy codebases, figure out efficiency opportunities, and carry out automated testing and deployment. Besides that, AI improves the organization's operational efficiency by generating the insights that can be used to level the workload and detect the anomalies. The coupling of the two is not only about saving the core business logic but also about enabling quicker innovation, less downtime, and enhanced system resilience.

However, traditional wet lab experiments are limited by efficiency and cost constraints, making it difficult to extensively explore potential associations between developed drugs and target miRNAs. Therefore, we have designed a novel machine learning model based on a multi-layer transformer-based graph neural network, DMAGT, specifically for predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. This model transforms drug-miRNA associations into graphs, employs Word2Vec for embedding features of drug molecular structures and miRNA base structures, and leverages a graph transformer model to learn from embedded features and relational structures, ultimately predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. To evaluate DMAGT, we tested its performance on three datasets composed of drug-miRNA associations: ncDR, RNAInter, and SM2miR, achieving up to AUC of $95.24\\pm0.05$. DMAGT demonstrated superior performance in comparative experiments tackling similar challenges. To validate its practical efficacy, we specifically focused on two drugs, namely 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin. Of the 20 potential drug-miRNA associations identified as the most likely, 14 were successfully validated.

While these models promise precise and personalized control, they also introduce new safety risks when model outputs are delivered directly to neural tissue. We propose a systematic, quantitative approach to detect and characterize unsafe stimulation patterns in ML-driven neurostimulation systems. Approach: We adapt an automated software testing technique known as coverage-guided fuzzing to the domain of neural stimulation. Here, fuzzing performs stress testing by perturbing model inputs and tracking whether resulting stimulation violates biophysical limits on charge density, instantaneous current, or electrode co-activation. The framework treats encoders as black boxes and steers exploration with coverage metrics that quantify how broadly test cases span the space of possible outputs and violation types. Main results: Applied to deep stimulus encoders for the retina and cortex, the method systematically reveals diverse stimulation regimes that exceed established safety limits. Two violation-output coverage metrics identify the highest number and diversity of unsafe outputs, enabling interpretable comparisons across architectures and training strategies. Significance: Violation-focused fuzzing reframes safety assessment as an empirical, reproducible process.

Current explainable RL methods seldom use state attributions to assist training. Rather, they treat all state features equally, thereby neglecting the heterogeneous impacts of individual state dimensions on the reward. We propose RKHS--SHAP-based Advanced Actor--Critic (RSA2C), an attribution-aware, kernelized, two-timescale AC algorithm, including Actor, Value Critic, and Advantage Critic. The Actor is instantiated in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with a Mahalanobis-weighted operator-valued kernel, while the Value Critic and Advantage Critic reside in scalar RKHSs. These RKHS-enhanced components use sparsified dictionaries: the Value Critic maintains its own dictionary, while the Actor and Advantage Critic share one.

We introduce the Continuous Flow Operator (CFO), a framework that learns continuous-time PDE dynamics without the computational burden of standard continuous approaches, e.g., neural ODE. The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency. CFO trained on only 25% of irregularly subsampled time points outperforms autoregressive baselines trained on complete data, with relative error reductions up to 87%.

Through analytic moment matching, we propagate uncertainty through deep additive structures while maintaining interpretability. We use three example studies to demonstrate the framework's ability to distinguish aleatoric from epistemic uncertainty: calibration of heteroscedastic measurement noise in fluid flow reconstruction, quantification of prediction confidence degradation in multi-step forecasting of advection-diffusion dynamics, and out-of-distribution detection in convolutional autoencoders.

The emerging challenge is no longer model fine-tuning but context engineering-how systems capture, structure, and govern external knowledge, memory, tools, and human input to enable trustworthy reasoning. Existing practices such as prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and tool integration remain fragmented, producing transient artefacts that limit traceability and accountability. This paper proposes a file-system abstraction for context engineering, inspired by the Unix notion that 'everything is a file'. The abstraction offers a persistent, governed infrastructure for managing heterogeneous context artefacts through uniform mounting, metadata, and access control. Implemented within the open-source AIGNE framework, the architecture realises a verifiable context-engineering pipeline, comprising the Context Constructor, Loader, and Evaluator, that assembles, delivers, and validates context under token constraints. As GenAI becomes an active collaborator in decision support, humans play a central role as curators, verifiers, and co-reasoners. The proposed architecture establishes a reusable foundation for accountable and human-centred AI co-work, demonstrated through two exemplars: an agent with memory and an MCP-based GitHub assistant. The implementation within the AIGNE framework demonstrates how the architecture can be operationalised in developer and industrial settings, supporting verifiable, maintainable, and industry-ready GenAI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u5de5\u7a0b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u60c5\u5883\u6784\u4ef6\u7edf\u4e00\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u91cd\u5851\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u60c5\u5883\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001RAG\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\uff09\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7Unix\"\u4e07\u7269\u7686\u6587\u4ef6\"\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6302\u8f7d\u3001\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u7ba1\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u60c5\u5883\u6784\u4ef6\u3002\u5728AIGNE\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5305\u542b\u60c5\u5883\u6784\u9020\u5668\u3001\u52a0\u8f7d\u5668\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u60c5\u5883\u5de5\u7a0b\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u5728AIGNE\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\uff08\u5177\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eMCP\u7684GitHub\u52a9\u624b\uff09\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u3001\u5de5\u4e1a\u5c31\u7eea\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684AI\u534f\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u7b56\u5c55\u4eba\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u548c\u5171\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u8005\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u60c5\u5883\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

While detecting LLM-generated text has been extensively studied, distinguishing human vs LLM-generated scientific idea remains an unexplored area. In this work, we systematically evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) machine learning models to differentiate between human and LLM-generated ideas, particularly after successive paraphrasing stages. Our findings highlight the challenges SOTA models face in source attribution, with detection performance declining by an average of 25.4\\% after five consecutive paraphrasing stages. Additionally, we demonstrate that incorporating the research problem as contextual information improves detection performance by up to 2.97%.

The former provides correctness guarantees but are rigid for complex requirements, whereas LLMs offer high flexibility at the risk of producing faulty code.This paper proposes iEcoreGen, a hybrid approach that integrates Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and LLMs. In EMF, an Ecore model defines a system structure and acts as a blueprint for code-generation.iEcoreGen decomposes requirements to derive operation specifications, uses EMF's template-based generator to produce initial Java code, and serializes specifications into docstrings. LLMs are then invoked to complete and fix unimplemented methods.

As these systems grow, extensive resources are required to develop and maintain simulation models of hardware and software components, as well as physical environments. Meanwhile, recent advances in generative AI have led to tools that can produce executable test cases for software systems, offering potential benefits such as reducing manual efforts or increasing test coverage. However, the application of generative AI techniques to simulation-based testing of large-scale cyber-physical systems remains underexplored. To better understand this gap, this study captures practitioners' perspectives on leveraging generative AI, based on a cross-company workshop with six organizations. Our contribution is twofold: (1) detailed, experience-based insights into challenges faced by engineers, and (2) a research agenda comprising three high-priority directions: (a) AI-generated scenarios and environment models, (b) simulators and AI in CI/CD pipelines, and (c) trustworthiness in generative AI for simulation. While participants acknowledged substantial potential, they also highlighted unresolved challenges.

In this paper, we test sensitivity and robustness of an artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecasting model: NVIDIAs FourCastNetv2 (FCNv2). We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity. Second, we start FCNv2 with fully random initial conditions and observe how the model responds to nonsensical inputs. Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise. With full random initial conditions, the model generates smooth and cohesive forecasts after a few timesteps, implying the models tendency towards stable, smoothed outputs. Our approach is simple and portable to other data-driven AI weather forecasting models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6d4b\u8bd5AI\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578bFourCastNetv2\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u98d3\u98ce\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u98d3\u98ce\uff09\u7684\u9884\u62a5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a1) \u5728\u98d3\u98ceFlorence\u7684ERA5\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5316\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u542f\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "FCNv2\u5728\u4f4e\u5230\u4e2d\u7b49\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4fdd\u6301\u98d3\u98ce\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u57fa\u672c\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u90fd\u4f4e\u4f30\u98ce\u66b4\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff1b\u5b8c\u5168\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u540e\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u9884\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "FCNv2\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4f4e\u4f30\u98ce\u66b4\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684AI\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Although prior work notes behavioral and other non-technical factors in AI integration, most studies still emphasize technical concerns and offer limited insight into how teams adapt to and trust AI. This paper proposes a Behavioral Software Engineering (BSE)-informed, human-centric framework to support SE organizations during early AI adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, we built and refined the framework through a literature review of organizational change models and thematic analysis of interview data, producing concrete, actionable steps. The framework comprises nine dimensions: AI Strategy Design, AI Strategy Evaluation, Collaboration, Communication, Governance and Ethics, Leadership, Organizational Culture, Organizational Dynamics, and Up-skilling, each supported by design principles and actions. To gather preliminary practitioner input, we conducted a survey (N=105) and two expert workshops (N=4). Survey results show that Up-skilling (15.2%) and AI Strategy Design (15.1%) received the highest $100-method allocations, underscoring their perceived importance in early AI initiatives. Findings indicate that organizations currently prioritize procedural elements such as strategy design, while human-centered guardrails remain less developed.

However, existing metrics for comparing optimization methods typically do not distinguish between these strategies, which often incur different communication costs in practice. To address this disparity, we introduce a simple and natural model of federated optimization that quantifies communication and local computation complexities. This new model allows for several commonly used client-selection strategies and explicitly associates each with a distinct cost. Within this setting, we propose a new algorithm that achieves the best-known communication and local complexities among existing federated optimization methods for non-convex optimization. This algorithm is based on the inexact composite gradient method with a carefully constructed gradient estimator and a special procedure for solving the auxiliary subproblem at each iteration. The gradient estimator is based on SAGA, a popular variance-reduced gradient estimator. We first derive a new variance bound for it, showing that SAGA can exploit functional similarity. We then introduce the Recursive-Gradient technique as a general way to potentially improve the error bound of a given conditionally unbiased gradient estimator, including both SAGA and SVRG. By applying this technique to SAGA, we obtain a new estimator, RG-SAGA, which has an improved error bound compared to the original one.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eSAGA\u5f00\u53d1RG-SAGA\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u5168\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u901a\u4fe1\u6216\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6848\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6bd4\u8f83\u6307\u6807\u672a\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "1) \u5efa\u7acb\u91cf\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8eSAGA\u5f00\u53d1RG-SAGA\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u9012\u5f52\u68af\u5ea6\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u6761\u4ef6\u65e0\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff1b4) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6784\u9020\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0cRG-SAGA\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cbSAGA\u5177\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Yet, as external threats such as software supply chain attacks on project health and quality assurance increase, mechanisms for assigning and enforcing responsibility have become increasingly critical. In 2017, GitHub introduced the CODEOWNERS feature, which automatically designates reviewers for specific files to strengthen accountability and protect critical parts of the codebase. Despite its potential, little is known about how CODEOWNERS is actually adopted and practiced. We present the first large-scale empirical study of CODEOWNERS usage across over 844,000 pull requests with 1.9 million comments and over 2 million reviews. We identify 10,287 code owners to track their review activities. Results indicate that codeowners tend to adhere the rules specified in the CODEOWNERS file, exhibit similar collaborative behaviours to traditional metrics of ownership, but tend to contribute to a smoother and faster PR workflow over time. Finally, using regression discontinuity design (RDD) analysis, we find that repositories adopting CODEOWNERS experience shifts in review dynamics, as ownership redistributes review responsibilities away from core developers. Our results position CODEOWNERS as a promising yet underutilized mechanism for improving software governance and resilience. We discuss how projects can leverage this alternative ownership method as a perspective to enhance security, accountability, and workflow efficiency in open-source development.", "AI": {"tldr": "GitHub\u7684CODEOWNERS\u529f\u80fd\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u4ee3\u7801\u6587\u4ef6\u5ba1\u67e5\u8005\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u672a\u77e5\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790CODEOWNERS\u5728844,000\u4e2aPR\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\u6240\u6709\u8005\u9075\u5b88\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6240\u6709\u6743\u6307\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u6d41\u7545\u5feb\u901f\u7684PR\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002\u91c7\u7528CODEOWNERS\u540e\uff0c\u5ba1\u67e5\u8d23\u4efb\u4ece\u6838\u5fc3\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u6240\u6709\u6743\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u968f\u7740\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u653b\u51fb\u7b49\u5916\u90e8\u5a01\u80c1\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6267\u884c\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53d8\u5f97\u6108\u53d1\u5173\u952e\u3002GitHub\u57282017\u5e74\u5f15\u5165CODEOWNERS\u529f\u80fd\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u7279\u5b9a\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u5ba1\u67e5\u8005\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u91c7\u7528\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u60c5\u51b5\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u8d85\u8fc7844,000\u4e2a\u62c9\u53d6\u8bf7\u6c42\u3001190\u4e07\u6761\u8bc4\u8bba\u548c200\u4e07\u6b21\u5ba1\u67e5\u8fdb\u884c\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8610,287\u540d\u4ee3\u7801\u6240\u6709\u8005\u5e76\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5ba1\u67e5\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u56de\u5f52\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u8bbe\u8ba1(RDD)\u5206\u6790\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30CODEOWNERS\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u5ba1\u67e5\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4ee3\u7801\u6240\u6709\u8005\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9075\u5b88CODEOWNERS\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6240\u6709\u6743\u6307\u6807\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u79fb\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u6d41\u7545\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u7684PR\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002\u91c7\u7528CODEOWNERS\u540e\uff0c\u5ba1\u67e5\u8d23\u4efb\u4ece\u6838\u5fc3\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u5ba1\u67e5\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "CODEOWNERS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u4f46\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u97e7\u6027\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u6240\u6709\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5f00\u6e90\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u8d23\u4efb\u6027\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

By following these steps, we demonstrate that PATHFINDER improves the performance of multi-hop QA over public benchmark datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "PATHFINDER\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u7b54\u6848\u53ec\u56de\u548cLLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9519\u8bef\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u6765\u5904\u7406\u68c0\u7d22\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u53d7LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u7b54\u6848\u53ec\u56de\u548cLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u88c1\u5224\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u5197\u957f\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b3) \u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u68c0\u7d22\u5931\u8d25\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "PATHFINDER\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9519\u8bef\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0cPATHFINDER\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While Shapley value based methods provide principled feature attributions, existing formulations cannot tractably evaluate higher order interactions: the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) requires exponential scale enumeration of subsets, and current tensor based approaches such as the Marginal SHAP Tensor (MST) are restricted to first order effects. The central problem is that no existing framework simultaneously preserves the axiomatic exactness of STII and avoids the exponential computational blow up inherent to high order discrete derivatives. Here we show that high order Shapley interactions can be represented exactly as tensor network contractions, enabling polynomial time and polylog depth computation under Tensor Train (TT) structure. We introduce Interaction Tensor SHAP (IT SHAP), which reformulates STII as the contraction of a Value Tensor and a Weight Tensor, and assume a finite state TT representation of the Weight Tensor with polynomial TT ranks. Under TT structured model and distribution tensors, we show that IT SHAP reduces the exponential complex Theta(4^n) of STII to NC2 parallel time. These results demonstrate that IT SHAP provides a unified, axiomatic, and computationally tractable formulation of main effects and higher order interactions in high dimensional models.

In such systems, end-to-end user requests traverse multiple different services and machines, exhibiting intricate interactions. Consequently, cloud service systems are vulnerable to concurrency bugs, which pose significant challenges to their reliability. Existing methods for concurrency bug detection often fall short due to their intrusive nature and inability to handle the architectural complexities of microservices. To address these limitations, we propose MicroRacer, a non-intrusive and automated framework for detecting concurrency bugs in such environments. By dynamically instrumenting widely-used libraries at runtime, MicroRacer collects detailed trace data without modifying the application code.

To mitigate these risks, we propose a novel unlearning framework tailored for LLM-based hardware code generation. Our method combines (i) a syntax-preserving unlearning strategy that safeguards the structural integrity of hardware code during forgetting, and (ii) a fine-grained floor-aware selective loss that enables precise and efficient removal of problematic knowledge. This integration achieves effective unlearning without degrading LLM code generation capabilities. Extensive experiments show that our framework supports forget sets up to 3x larger, typically requiring only a single training epoch, while preserving both syntactic correctness and functional integrity of register-transfer level (RTL) codes.

This flexibility, however, makes correctness harder to ensure as the same extensibility that accelerates development also complicates maintaining the testing infrastructure. Extensible languages require automated test generation that is both dialect-agnostic (works across dialects without manual adaptation) and dialect-effective (targets dialect-specific features to find bugs). Existing approaches typically sacrifice one of these goals by either requiring manually constructed seed corpora for each dialect, or by failing to be effective. We present a dialect-agnostic and dialect-effective grammar-based and coverage-guided fuzzing approach for extensible compilers that combines two key insights from existing work: (i) the grammars of dialects, which already encode the structural and type constraints, can often be extracted automatically from the dialect specification; and (ii) these grammars can be used in combination with pre-trained large language models to automatically generate representative and diverse seed inputs from the full dialect space without requiring any manual input or training data. These seeds can then be used to bootstrap coverage-guided fuzzers. We built this approach into a tool, Germinator. When evaluated on six MLIR projects spanning 91 dialects, Germinator generated seeds improve line coverage by 10-120% over grammar-based baselines. We compare against grammar-based baselines because they are the only class of existing automatic seed generators that can be applied uniformly across MLIR's heterogeneous dialect ecosystem.

We propose reframing this as a natural language reasoning task by transforming codebases into hierarchical NL summaries and performing NL-to-NL search instead of cross-modal retrieval. Our approach builds context-aware summaries at file, directory, and repository levels, then uses a two-phase search: first routing bug reports to relevant repositories, then performing top-down localization within those repositories. Evaluated on DNext, an industrial system with 46 repositories and 1.1M lines of code, our method achieves Pass@10 of 0.82 and MRR of 0.50, significantly outperforming retrieval baselines and agentic RAG systems like GitHub Copilot and Cursor.

Although high-dimensional text can encode rich contextual information, it also poses unique challenges for causal identification and estimation. In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "CATR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5904\u7406\u91cd\u53e0\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u8fdd\u53cd\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u7f16\u7801\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u53e0\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u8fdd\u53cd\u3001\u6781\u7aef\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u3001\u6743\u91cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u81a8\u80c0\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u6dc6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5408\u7406\u5316\uff08CATR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6807\u8bb0\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65e0\u6df7\u6dc6\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e22\u5f03\u65e0\u5173\u6587\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548cMIMIC-III\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cCATR\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "CATR\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This overhead stems primarily from pervasive instrumentation of memory accesses - a significant fraction of which is redundant. We addresses this inefficiency through a static, compiler-integrated approach that identifies and eliminates redundant instrumentation, drastically reducing the runtime cost of dynamic data race detectors. We introduce a suite of interprocedural static analyses reasoning about memory access patterns, synchronization, and thread creation to eliminate instrumentation for provably race-free accesses and show that the completeness properties of the data race detector are preserved. We further observe that many inserted checks flag a race if and only if a preceding check has already flagged an equivalent race for the same memory location - albeit potentially at a different access. We characterize this notion of equivalence and show that, when limiting reporting to at least one representative for each equivalence class, a further class of redundant checks can be eliminated. We identify such accesses using a novel dominance-based elimination analysis. Based on these two insights, we have implemented five static analyses within the LLVM, integrated with the instrumentation pass of the race detector ThreadSanitizer. Our experimental evaluation on a diverse suite of real-world applications demonstrates that our approach significantly reduces race detection overhead, achieving a geomean speedup of 1.34x, with peak speedups reaching 2.5x under high thread contention.

A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 20 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables. Our forecasts of radar composite reflectivity show that CorrDiff, as a generative model, can generate fine-scale details that lead to more realistic predictions compared to the corresponding deterministic regression models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8eCorrDiff\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2d\u56fd\u533a\u57df\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ece25km\u5168\u7403\u7f51\u683c\u9884\u62a5\u751f\u62103km\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u533a\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9884\u62a5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7edf\u8ba1\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u95f4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684CorrDiff\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u8fd120\u500d\u5927\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u5730\u8868\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u5305\u542b\u516d\u4e2a\u6c14\u538b\u5c42\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u6dfb\u52a0\u5168\u5c40\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eCMA-GFS\u548cSFF\u768425km\u5168\u7403\u7f51\u683c\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u751f\u62103km\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9884\u62a5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u540e\u7684\u9884\u62a5\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u7684MAE\u4e0a\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u4e8eCMA-MESO\u533a\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u62a5\u3002\u96f7\u8fbe\u7ec4\u5408\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u9884\u62a5\u663e\u793a\uff0cCorrDiff\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eCorrDiff\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u56fd\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u533a\u57df\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6355\u6349\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

This paper investigates whether AI-assisted end-user coding is a feasible paradigm for end-user development, which may complement or even replace the LCNC model in the future.

While many scoring functions perform well on standard benchmarks, their ability to generalize beyond training data remains a significant challenge. In this work, we evaluate the generalization capability of state-of-the-art scoring functions on dataset splits that simulate evaluation on targets with a limited number of known structures and experimental affinity measurements. Our analysis reveals that the commonly used benchmarks do not reflect the true challenge of generalizing to novel targets.

Despite mining's evolution into a capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) >= 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI <= 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multi-scale temporal patterns in mining profitability. Evaluated on data from 20 ASIC miners released between 2015 and 2024 across diverse market regimes, MineROI-Net outperforms LSTM-based and TSLANet baselines, achieving 83.7% accuracy and 83.1% macro F1-score. The model demonstrates strong economic relevance, achieving 93.6% precision in detecting unprofitable periods and 98.5% precision for profitable ones, while avoiding misclassification of profitable scenarios as unprofitable and vice versa.

Nevertheless, LLM-driven generation remains challenging: the token-level design loop is discrete and non-differentiable, preventing feedback from smoothly guiding architectural improvement. These methods, in turn, commonly suffer from mode collapse into redundant structures or drift toward infeasible designs when constructive reasoning is not well grounded. We introduce RevoNAD, a reflective evolutionary orchestrator that effectively bridges LLM-based reasoning with feedback-aligned architectural search. First, RevoNAD presents a Multi-round Multi-expert Consensus to transfer isolated design rules into meaningful architectural clues. Then, Adaptive Reflective Exploration adjusts the degree of exploration leveraging reward variance; it explores when feedback is uncertain and refines when stability is reached.

We propose Triplet-GCN, a single-branch graph convolutional model that represents each encounter as patient-feature-value triplets, constructs a bipartite EHR graph, and learns patient embeddings via a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) followed by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). The pipeline applies type-specific preprocessing -- median imputation and standardization for numeric variables, effect coding for binary features, and mode imputation with low-dimensional embeddings for rare categorical attributes -- and initializes patient nodes with summary statistics, while retaining measurement values on edges to preserve \"who measured what and by how much\". In a retrospective, multi-center Chinese cohort (N = 648; 70/30 train-test split) drawn from three tertiary hospitals, Triplet-GCN consistently outperforms strong tabular baselines (KNN, SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest) across discrimination and balanced error metrics, yielding a more favorable sensitivity-specificity trade-off and improved overall utility for early warning.

However, issues such as missing values and anomalies in sequential data hinder its further development in prediction tasks. Previous research has primarily focused on extracting feature information from sequence data or addressing these suboptimal data as positive samples for knowledge transfer. A more effective approach would be to leverage these non-ideal negative samples to enhance event prediction. In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training.

This study examines how ensembles balance accuracy and overfitting across four tabular classification tasks: Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, Pima Diabetes, and Credit Card Fraud. Using repeated stratified cross validation with statistical significance testing, we compare linear models, a single decision tree, and nine ensemble methods. The results show that ensembles can reach high accuracy without large gaps by reducing variance through averaging or controlled boosting. On nearly linear and clean data, linear models already generalize well and ensembles offer little additional benefit. On datasets with meaningful nonlinear structure, tree based ensembles increase test accuracy by 5 to 7 points while keeping gaps below 3 percent. On noisy or highly imbalanced datasets, ensembles remain competitive but require regularization to avoid fitting noise or majority class patterns. We also compute simple dataset complexity indicators, such as linearity score, Fisher ratio, and noise estimate, which explain when ensembles are likely to control variance effectively. Overall, the study provides a clear view of how and when ensembles maintain high accuracy while keeping overfitting low, offering practical guidance for model selection in real world tabular applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4f18\u52bf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9700\u8981\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u590d\u5206\u5c42\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5355\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u548c9\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8868\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u3001\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u3001\u4fe1\u7528\u5361\u6b3a\u8bc8\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u5747\u6216\u53d7\u63a7\u63d0\u5347\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u96c6\u6210\u4f18\u52bf\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6811\u57fa\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cbe\u5ea65-7\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u4f4e\u4e8e3%\uff1b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9700\u8981\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u3001Fisher\u6bd4\u7387\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u6210\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u683c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Various complex factors lead to intricate low-altitude turbulence outcomes. Under current observational conditions, especially when using only wind profile radar data, traditional methods struggle to accurately predict turbulence states. Therefore, this paper introduces a NeuTucker decomposition model utilizing discretized data. Designed for continuous yet sparse three-dimensional wind field data, it constructs a low-rank Tucker decomposition model based on a Tucker neural network to capture the latent interactions within the three-dimensional wind field data. Therefore, two core ideas are proposed here: 1) Discretizing continuous input data to adapt to models like NeuTucF that require discrete data inputs. 2) Constructing a four-dimensional Tucker interaction tensor to represent all possible spatio-temporal interactions among different elevations and three-dimensional wind speeds. In estimating missing observations in real datasets, this discretized NeuTucF model demonstrates superior performance compared to various common regression models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684NeuTucker\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7a7a\u6e4d\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u56db\u7ef4Tucker\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f20\u91cf\u6355\u6349\u4e09\u7ef4\u98ce\u573a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u89c2\u6d4b\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u7a7a\u6e4d\u6d41\u590d\u6742\u591a\u53d8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u98ce\u5ed3\u7ebf\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6e4d\u6d41\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u98ce\u573a\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "1) \u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8fde\u7eed\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94NeuTucF\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u79bb\u6563\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u6784\u5efa\u56db\u7ef4Tucker\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f20\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u98ce\u901f\u95f4\u7684\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u65f6\u7a7a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8eTucker\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6784\u5efa\u4f4e\u79e9Tucker\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u89c2\u6d4b\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u5316NeuTucF\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u591a\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316NeuTucker\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e09\u7ef4\u98ce\u573a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u6e4d\u6d41\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7a7a\u6e4d\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce Credal and Interval Deep Evidential Classifications (CDEC and IDEC, respectively) as novel approaches to address UQ in classification tasks. CDEC and IDEC leverage a credal set (closed and convex set of probabilities) and an interval of evidential predictive distributions, respectively, allowing us to avoid overfitting to the training data and to systematically assess both epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainties. When those surpass acceptable thresholds, CDEC and IDEC have the capability to abstain from classification and flag an excess of epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty, as relevant. Conversely, within acceptable uncertainty bounds, CDEC and IDEC provide a collection of labels with robust probabilistic guarantees. CDEC and IDEC are trained using standard backpropagation and a loss function that draws from the theory of evidence. They overcome the shortcomings of previous efforts, and extend the current evidential deep learning literature. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, together with their natural OoD shifts (F-MNIST/K-MNIST, SVHN/Intel, TinyImageNet), we show that CDEC and IDEC achieve competitive predictive accuracy, state-of-the-art OoD detection under epistemic and total uncertainty, and tight, well-calibrated prediction regions that expand reliably under distribution shift.

The superiority of $\\mathcal{IDK}$-$\\mathcal{S}$ is attributed to two key innovations. First, it inherits the strengths of the Isolation Distributional Kernel, an offline detector that has demonstrated significant performance advantages over foundational methods like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor due to the use of a data-dependent kernel. Second, it adopts a lightweight incremental update mechanism that significantly reduces computational overhead compared to the naive baseline strategy of performing a full model retraining. This is achieved without compromising detection accuracy, a claim supported by its statistical equivalence to the full retrained model.

Recent works in mechanistic interpretability have shown that neural networks represent meaningful concepts as directions in their representation spaces and often encode many concepts in superposition. Various sparse dictionary learning (SDL) methods, including sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders, address this by training auxiliary models with sparsity constraints to disentangle these superposed concepts into interpretable features. These methods have demonstrated remarkable empirical success but have limited theoretical understanding. Existing theoretical work is limited to sparse autoencoders with tied-weight constraints, leaving the broader family of SDL methods without formal grounding. In this work, we develop the first unified theoretical framework considering SDL as one unified optimization problem. We demonstrate how diverse methods instantiate the theoretical framwork and provide rigorous analysis on the optimization landscape. We provide the first theoretical explanations for some empirically observed phenomena, including feature absorption, dead neurons, and the neuron resampling technique. We further design controlled experiments to validate our theoretical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u8f6c\u7801\u5668\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u5438\u6536\u3001\u6b7b\u4ea1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7b49\u7ecf\u9a8c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6210\u529f\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6743\u91cd\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684SDL\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u79cdSDL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u8f6c\u7801\u5668\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u7ecf\u9a8c\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684SDL\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u5438\u6536\u3001\u6b7b\u4ea1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u7b49\u7ecf\u9a8c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6210\u529f\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recent approaches consider a representation of local neighborhood in each view independently, and then capture the consistent neighbors across all views via a learning process.

First, there is no guarantee that they can capture consistent neighbors well, especially when the same neighbors are in regions of varied densities in different views, resulting in inferior detection accuracy. Second, the learning process has a high computational cost of $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, rendering them inapplicable for large datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel method termed \\textbf{S}pherical \\textbf{C}onsistent \\textbf{N}eighborhoods \\textbf{E}nsemble (SCoNE). It has two unique features: (a) the consistent neighborhoods are represented with multi-view instances directly, requiring no intermediate representations as used in existing approaches; and (b) the neighborhoods have data-dependent properties, which lead to large neighborhoods in sparse regions and small neighborhoods in dense regions. The data-dependent properties enable local neighborhoods in different views to be represented well as consistent neighborhoods, without learning. This leads to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ time complexity.

Yet despite evidence that LLMs exhibit complementary strengths across tasks, traditionally best-of-$n$ relies on a single model to generate responses. We propose RoBoN (Routed Online Best-of-$n$), a sequential multi-LLM alternative to the prevailing single-model best-of-$n$. Given a suite of models $\\{m_i\\}_{i=1}^M$, RoBoN sequentially routes generations one-by-one across models, based on scores computed using a reward model and an agreement signal on the predicted responses.

Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) is a widely used technique that explains the prediction of any classifier by learning an interpretable model locally around the predicted instance. However, it assumes that the local decision boundary is linear and fails to capture the non-linear relationships, leading to incorrect explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can generate high-fidelity explanations. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity of the explanation. Additionally, we utilize the N-ball sampling technique, which samples directly from the desired distribution instead of reweighting samples as done in LIME, further improving the faithfulness score. We evaluate our method on three UCI datasets across different classifiers and varying kernel widths. Experimental results show that our method yields more faithful explanations compared to baselines, achieving an average reduction of 37% in root mean square error, significantly improving local fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMARS\u548cN-ball\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4LIME\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5c40\u90e8\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9ed1\u76d2\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u91ca\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002LIME\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5c40\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5143\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56de\u5f52\u6837\u6761\uff08MARS\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5c40\u90e8\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u91c7\u7528N-ball\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u671f\u671b\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u50cfLIME\u90a3\u6837\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u6837\u672c", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aUCI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1137%\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7MARS\u5efa\u6a21\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u548cN-ball\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LIME\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027"}}

However, the off-policy training paradigm introduces distribution shift, which often pushes the policy beyond the trust region, leading to training instabilities manifested as fluctuations in policy entropy and unstable gradients. Although PPO-Clip mitigates this issue through importance clipping, it still overlooks the global distributional shift of actions. To address these challenges, we propose using the entropy ratio between the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce an \\textbf{Entropy Ratio Clipping} (ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio.

Code available at: https://github.com/charliezchen/scaling-matrix-preconditioning", "summary": "Several recently introduced deep learning optimizers utilizing matrix-level preconditioning have shown promising speedups relative to the current dominant optimizer AdamW, particularly in relatively small-scale experiments. However, efforts to validate and replicate their successes have reported mixed results. To better understand the effectiveness of these optimizers at scale, in this work we investigate how to scale preconditioned optimizers via hyperparameter transfer, building on prior works such as $\u03bc$P. We study how the optimal learning rate and weight decay should scale with model width and depth for a wide range of optimizers, including Shampoo, SOAP, and Muon, accounting for the impact of commonly used techniques such as blocking and grafting. We find that scaling the learning rate according to $\u03bc$P improves transfer, but can still suffer from significant finite-width deviations that cause drifting optimal learning rates, which we show can be mitigated by blocking and explicit spectral normalization. For compute-optimal scaling, we find scaling independent weight decay as $1/\\mathrm{width}$ is nearly optimal across optimizers. Applying these scaling rules, we show Muon and Shampoo consistently achieve $1.4\\times$ and $1.3\\times$ speedup over AdamW for training Llama-architecture language models of sizes ranging from $190$M to $1.4$B, whereas the speedup vanishes rapidly with scale under incorrect scaling. Based on these results and further ablations, we argue that studying optimal hyperparameter transfer is essential for reliably comparing optimizers at scale given a realistic tuning budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8fc1\u79fb\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982Shampoo\u3001SOAP\u3001Muon\uff09\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9075\u5faa\u03bcP\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5219\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5757\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7f29\u653e\u4e2d\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5e94\u968f\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53cd\u6bd4\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728Llama\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b01.3-1.4\u500d\u4e8eAdamW\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u671f\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u9635\u7ea7\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8eAdamW\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u590d\u73b0\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u3002\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8fc1\u79fb\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6Shampoo\u3001SOAP\u3001Muon\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u5206\u5757\u548c\u5ac1\u63a5\u7b49\u5e38\u7528\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u03bcP\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6709\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5757\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u9075\u5faa\u03bcP\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5219\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6709\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5206\u5757\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7f29\u653e\u4e2d\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u63091/\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c4\u5219\u540e\uff0cMuon\u548cShampoo\u5728190M\u81f31.4B\u53c2\u6570\u7684Llama\u67b6\u6784\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b01.4\u500d\u548c1.3\u500d\u4e8eAdamW\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u800c\u9519\u8bef\u7f29\u653e\u4e0b\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u968f\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\u8fc5\u901f\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6700\u4f18\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8fc1\u79fb\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u8c03\u4f18\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u6bd4\u8f83\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5219\u80fd\u4f7f\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u800c\u9519\u8bef\u7f29\u653e\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u52bf\u8fc5\u901f\u6d88\u5931\u3002"}}

Such evaluations quantify how well a function behaves on a distribution, but they do not address whether the internal decomposition of a model is uniquely determined by the data and evaluation design. In this paper, we introduce \\emph{Modular Jets} for regression and classification pipelines. Given a task manifold (input space), a modular decomposition, and access to module-level representations, we estimate empirical jets, which are local linear response maps that describe how each module reacts to small structured perturbations of the input. We propose an empirical notion of \\emph{mirage} regimes, where multiple distinct modular decompositions induce indistinguishable jets and thus remain observationally equivalent, and contrast this with an \\emph{identifiable} regime, where the observed jets single out a decomposition up to natural symmetries. In the setting of two-module linear regression pipelines we prove a jet-identifiability theorem. Under mild rank assumptions and access to module-level jets, the internal factorisation is uniquely determined, whereas risk-only evaluation admits a large family of mirage decompositions that implement the same input-to-output map.

While data filtering has emerged as a pretraining-time mitigation, it faces significant challenges: labeling whether data is harmful is expensive at scale, and given improving sample efficiency with larger models, even small amounts of mislabeled content could give rise to dangerous capabilities. To address risks associated with mislabeled harmful content, prior work proposed Gradient Routing (Cloud et al., 2024) -- a technique that localizes target knowledge into a dedicated subset of model parameters so they can later be removed. We explore an improved variant of Gradient Routing, which we call Selective GradienT Masking (SGTM), with particular focus on evaluating its robustness to label noise. SGTM zero-masks selected gradients such that target domain examples only update their dedicated parameters. We test SGTM's effectiveness in two applications: removing knowledge of one language from a model trained on a bilingual synthetic dataset, and removing biology knowledge from a model trained on English Wikipedia. In both cases SGTM provides better retain/forget trade-off in the presence of labeling errors compared to both data filtering and a previously proposed instantiation of Gradient Routing. Unlike shallow unlearning approaches that can be quickly undone through fine-tuning, SGTM exhibits strong robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, requiring seven times more fine-tuning steps to reach baseline performance on the forget set compared to a finetuning-based unlearning method (RMU).

In current practice, analog beamforming uses a codebook of pre-configured beams with each of them radiating towards a specific direction, and a beam management function continuously selects \\textit{optimal} beams for moving user equipments (UEs). However, large codebooks and effects caused by reflections or blockages of beams make an optimal beam selection challenging. In contrast to previous work and standardization efforts that opt for supervised learning to train classifiers to predict the next best beam based on previously selected beams we formulate the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and model the environment as the codebook itself. At each time step, we select a candidate beam conditioned on the belief state of the unobservable optimal beam and previously probed beams. This frames the beam selection problem as an online search procedure that locates the moving optimal beam.

We introduce a computational framework for teaching language models to predict chemical reaction mechanisms through arrow pushing formalism, a century-old notation that tracks electron flow while respecting conservation laws. We developed MechSMILES, a compact textual format encoding molecular structure and electron flow, and trained language models on four mechanism prediction tasks of increasing complexity using mechanistic reaction datasets, such as mech-USPTO-31k and FlowER. Our models achieve more than 95\\% top-3 accuracy on elementary step prediction and scores that surpass 73\\% on mech-USPTO-31k, and 93\\% on FlowER dataset for the retrieval of complete reaction mechanisms on our hardest task. This mechanistic understanding enables three key applications. First, our models serve as post-hoc validators for CASP systems, filtering chemically implausible transformations.

Third, they extract catalyst-aware reaction templates that distinguish recycled catalysts from spectator species.

We begin by highlighting the limitations of standard neural differential equations in modeling complex systems, where physical invariants (like energy) are often absent but other constraints (like mass conservation, network locality, bounded rationality) must be enforced. To address this, we introduce Agent-Based-Model informed Neural Networks(ABM-NNs), which leverage restricted graph neural networks and hierarchical decomposition to learn interpretable, structure-preserving dynamics. We validate the framework across three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a generalized Generalized Lotka--Volterra system, where we recover ground-truth parameters from short trajectories in presence of interventions; (ii) a graph-based SIR contagion model, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning baselines (GCN, GraphSAGE, Graph Transformer) in out-of-sample forecasting and noise robustness; and (iii) a real-world macroeconomic model of the ten largest economies, where we learn coupled GDP dynamics from empirical data and demonstrate gradient-based counterfactual analysis for policy interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faABM-NNs\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u539f\u5219\u878d\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u795e\u7ecf\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u80fd\u91cf\uff09\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5176\u4ed6\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u8d28\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u3001\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\uff09\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u5219\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ABM-NNs\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u89e3\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a1\uff09\u5e7f\u4e49Lotka-Volterra\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ece\u77ed\u8f68\u8ff9\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u53c2\u6570\uff1b2\uff09\u56fe\u57faSIR\u4f20\u67d3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b3\uff09\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8026\u5408GDP\u52a8\u6001\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "ABM-NNs\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u539f\u5219\u878d\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

While classical analyses emphasize numerical stability of Jacobian products, we show that stability alone is insufficient: learnability is governed instead by the \\emph{effective learning rates} $\u03bc_{t,\\ell}$, per-lag and per-neuron quantities obtained from first-order expansions of gate-induced Jacobian products in Backpropagation Through Time. These effective learning rates act as multiplicative filters that control both the magnitude and anisotropy of gradient transport. Under heavy-tailed ($\u03b1$-stable) gradient noise, we prove that the minimal sample size required to detect a dependency at lag~$\\ell$ satisfies $N(\\ell)\\propto f(\\ell)^{-\u03b1}$, where $f(\\ell)=\\|\u03bc_{t,\\ell}\\|_1$ is the effective learning rate envelope. This leads to an explicit formula for $\\mathcal{H}_N$ and closed-form scaling laws for logarithmic, polynomial, and exponential decay of $f(\\ell)$. The theory predicts that broader or more heterogeneous gate spectra produce slower decay of $f(\\ell)$ and hence larger learnability windows, whereas heavier-tailed noise compresses $\\mathcal{H}_N$ by slowing statistical concentration. By linking gate-induced time-scale structure, gradient noise, and sample complexity, the framework identifies the effective learning rates as the fundamental quantities that govern when -- and for how long -- gated recurrent networks can learn long-range temporal dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u51b3\u5b9a\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\"\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7a97\u53e3\"\u2014\u2014\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u7531\"\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\"\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5f3a\u8c03\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u4e58\u79ef\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u957f\u7a0b\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u5c55\u5f00\u95e8\u63a7\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u4e58\u79ef\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u6ede\u548c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u03bc_{t,\u2113}\u3002\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\uff08\u03b1-\u7a33\u5b9a\uff09\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u6ede\u2113\u4f9d\u8d56\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u91cfN(\u2113)\u221df(\u2113)^{-\u03b1}\uff0c\u5176\u4e2df(\u2113)=\u2016\u03bc_{t,\u2113}\u2016\u2081\u662f\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u5305\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7a97\u53e3H_N\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caf(\u2113)\u5bf9\u6570\u3001\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u548c\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u6807\u5ea6\u5f8b\u3002\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u5bbd\u6216\u66f4\u5f02\u8d28\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u8c31\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6162\u7684f(\u2113)\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u91cd\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u6162\u7edf\u8ba1\u96c6\u4e2d\u6765\u538b\u7f29H_N\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u662f\u63a7\u5236\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u4f55\u65f6\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u957f\u7a0b\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u91cf\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u95e8\u63a7\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Despite rapid empirical progress, its theoretical foundations remain limited: existing methods (gradient, distribution, trajectory matching) are built on heterogeneous surrogate objectives and optimization assumptions, which makes it difficult to analyze their common principles or provide general guarantees. Moreover, it is still unclear under what conditions distilled data can retain the effectiveness of full datasets when the training configuration, such as optimizer, architecture, or augmentation, changes. To answer these questions, we propose a unified theoretical framework, termed configuration--dynamics--error analysis, which reformulates major DD approaches under a common generalization-error perspective and provides two main results: (i) a scaling law that provides a single-configuration upper bound, characterizing how the error decreases as the distilled sample size increases and explaining the commonly observed performance saturation effect; and (ii) a coverage law showing that the required distilled sample size scales linearly with configuration diversity, with provably matching upper and lower bounds. In addition, our unified analysis reveals that various matching methods are interchangeable surrogates, reducing the same generalization error, clarifying why they can all achieve dataset distillation and providing guidance on how surrogate choices affect sample efficiency and robustness. Experiments across diverse methods and configurations empirically confirm the derived laws, advancing a theoretical foundation for DD and enabling theory-driven design of compact, configuration-robust dataset distillation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u6837\u672c\u6570\u589e\u957f\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u968f\u914d\u7f6e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u867d\u7136\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8fdb\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u5171\u540c\u539f\u7406\u6216\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff09\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u914d\u7f6e-\u52a8\u6001-\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e3b\u8981\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a1) \u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\uff08\u5355\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u754c\uff09\uff1b2) \u8986\u76d6\u89c4\u5f8b\uff08\u6240\u9700\u84b8\u998f\u6837\u672c\u6570\u4e0e\u914d\u7f6e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff1a1) \u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u84b8\u998f\u6837\u672c\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9971\u548c\u6548\u5e94\uff1b2) \u6240\u9700\u84b8\u998f\u6837\u672c\u6570\u4e0e\u914d\u7f6e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u548c\u4e0b\u754c\uff1b3) \u5404\u79cd\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u914d\u7f6e\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This work investigates the application of SNNs to high-frequency price-spike forecasting, enhancing performance via robust hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian Optimization (BO). This work converts high-frequency stock data into spike trains and evaluates three architectures: an established unsupervised STDP-trained SNN, a novel SNN with explicit inhibitory competition, and a supervised backpropagation network. BO was driven by a novel objective, Penalized Spike Accuracy (PSA), designed to ensure a network's predicted price spike rate aligns with the empirical rate of price events. Simulated trading demonstrated that models optimized with PSA consistently outperformed their Spike Accuracy (SA)-tuned counterparts and baselines. Specifically, the extended SNN model with PSA achieved the highest cumulative return (76.8%) in simple backtesting, significantly surpassing the supervised alternative (42.54% return).

However, it remains an open question of how to best determine which of the many possible model checkpoints resulting from a large training run to use as the starting point. This becomes especially important when data for the target task of interest is scarce, unlabeled and out-of-distribution. In such scenarios, common methods relying on in-distribution validation data become unreliable or inapplicable. This work proposes a novel approach for model selection that operates reliably on just a few unlabeled examples from the target task. Our approach is based on a novel concept: Neural Coherence, which entails characterizing a model's activation statistics for source and target domains, allowing one to define model selection methods with high data-efficiency.

Rather, they minimize the constraint violations in a soft way. Strict satisfaction of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) to embed domain knowledge and first-principles in data-driven models is generally challenging. This is because data-driven models consider the original functions to be black-box whose derivatives can only be obtained after evaluating the functions. We introduce DAE-HardNet, a physics-constrained (rather than simply physics-informed) neural network that learns both the functions and their derivatives simultaneously, while enforcing algebraic as well as differential constraints. This is done by projecting model predictions onto the constraint manifold using a differentiable projection layer. We apply DAE-HardNet to several systems and test problems governed by DAEs, including the dynamic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system and transient heat conduction. We also show the ability of DAE-HardNet to estimate unknown parameters through a parameter estimation problem. Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and PINNs, DAE-HardNet achieves orders of magnitude reduction in the physics loss while maintaining the prediction accuracy. It has the added benefits of learning the derivatives which improves the constrained learning of the backbone neural network prior to the projection layer. For specific problems, this suggests that the projection layer can be bypassed for faster inference.

Simultaneously, controlling the Lipschitz constant in neural networks has emerged as an essential area of research to enhance adversarial robustness and network certifiability. This paper presents a rigorous approach to the general design of $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz deep residual networks using a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) framework. Initially, the ResNet architecture was reformulated as a cyclic tridiagonal LMI, and closed-form constraints on network parameters were derived to ensure $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz continuity; however, using a new $LDL^\\top$ decomposition approach for certifying LMI feasibility, we extend the construction of $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipchitz networks to any other nonlinear architecture. Our contributions include a provable parameterization methodology for constructing Lipschitz-constrained residual networks and other hierarchical architectures. Cholesky decomposition is also used for efficient parameterization. These findings enable robust network designs applicable to adversarial robustness, certified training, and control systems.

In this work, we prove that such strategies are suboptimal for approximating the attention matrix. We introduce KQ-SVD, a simple and computationally efficient method that directly performs an optimal low-rank decomposition of the attention matrix via a closed-form solution.

An emerging approach to address this problem relies on \\emph{disagreement discrepancy} -- a measure of how the disagreement between two models changes under a shifting distribution. The process of maximizing this measure has seen applications in bounding error under shifts, testing for harmful shifts, and training more robust models. However, this optimization involves the non-differentiable zero-one loss, necessitating the use of practical surrogate losses. We prove that existing surrogates for disagreement discrepancy are not Bayes consistent, revealing a fundamental flaw: maximizing these surrogates can fail to maximize the true disagreement discrepancy. To address this, we introduce new theoretical results providing both upper and lower bounds on the optimality gap for such surrogates. Guided by this theory, we propose a novel disagreement loss that, when paired with cross-entropy, yields a provably consistent surrogate for disagreement discrepancy. Empirical evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides more accurate and robust estimates of disagreement discrepancy than existing approaches, particularly under challenging adversarial conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u5206\u6b67\u5dee\u5f02\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u8fb9\u754c\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u56e0\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u800c\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u5206\u6b67\u5dee\u5f02\u5ea6\u91cf\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u53ef\u5fae\u76840-1\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u7136\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u6b67\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6b67\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u914d\u5bf9\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u5206\u6b67\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5206\u6b67\u5dee\u5f02\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6b67\u5dee\u5f02\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u8fb9\u754c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, large increases in computing power and the greater availability of Big Data have dramatically increased the probability of re-identifying anonymized data, potentially violating the pledge of confidentiality given to survey respondents. Data science tools can be used to produce synthetic data that preserve critical moments of the empirical data but do not contain the records of any existing individual respondent or business. Developing public-use firm data from surveys presents unique challenges different from demographic data, because there is a lack of anonymity and certain industries can be easily identified in each geographic area. This paper briefly describes a machine learning model used to construct a synthetic PUMS based on the Annual Business Survey (ABS) and discusses various quality metrics. Although the ABS PUMS is currently being refined and results are confidential, we present two synthetic PUMS developed for the 2007 Survey of Business Owners, similar to the ABS business data. Econometric replication of a high impact analysis published in Small Business Economics demonstrates the verisimilitude of the synthetic data to the true data and motivates discussion of possible ABS use cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u5e74\u5ea6\u5546\u4e1a\u8c03\u67e5(ABS)\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u516c\u5171\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c(PUMS)\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5546\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u53bb\u533f\u540d\u5316\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u590d\u5236\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u5927\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u533f\u540d\u5316\u5546\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc6\u522b\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdd\u53cd\u8c03\u67e5\u53d7\u8bbf\u8005\u7684\u4fdd\u5bc6\u627f\u8bfa\u3002\u5546\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u53bb\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6311\u6218\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u533f\u540d\u6027\u4e14\u67d0\u4e9b\u884c\u4e1a\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5730\u7406\u533a\u57df\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e74\u5ea6\u5546\u4e1a\u8c03\u67e5(ABS)\u7684\u5408\u6210PUMS\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u4f46\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u4efb\u4f55\u771f\u5b9e\u4e2a\u4f53\u6216\u4f01\u4e1a\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e862007\u5e74\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e3b\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u5408\u6210PUMS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5236\u300a\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u300b\u4e0a\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002\u867d\u7136ABS PUMS\u4ecd\u5728\u5b8c\u5584\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u4fdd\u5bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6848\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u5546\u4e1a\u8c03\u67e5\u53d7\u8bbf\u8005\u7684\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aABS\u7b49\u5546\u4e1a\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u7684\u516c\u5171\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Sensors fail, records are inconsistent, and datasets collected from different sources often differ in scale, sampling rate, and quality. These differences create missing values that make it difficult to combine data and build reliable models. Standard imputation methods such as regression models, expectation-maximization, and multiple imputation rely on strong assumptions about linearity and independence. These assumptions rarely hold for complex or heterogeneous data, which can lead to biased or over-smoothed estimates. We propose Impugan, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for imputing missing values and integrating heterogeneous datasets. The model is trained on complete samples to learn how missing variables depend on observed ones. During inference, the generator reconstructs missing entries from available features, and the discriminator enforces realism by distinguishing true from imputed data. This adversarial process allows Impugan to capture nonlinear and multimodal relationships that conventional methods cannot represent. In experiments on benchmark datasets and a multi-source integration task, Impugan achieves up to 82\\% lower Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and 70\\% lower mutual-information deviation (MI) compared to leading baselines. These results show that adversarially trained generative models provide a scalable and principled approach for imputing and merging incomplete, heterogeneous data.

However, growing evidence shows that models trained in such way often suffer from a significant loss in diversity. We argue that this arises because RL implicitly optimizes the \"mode-seeking\" or \"zero-forcing\" Reverse KL to a target distribution causing the model to concentrate mass on certain high-probability regions of the target while neglecting others. In this work, we instead begin from an explicit target distribution, obtained by filtering out incorrect answers while preserving the relative probabilities of correct ones. Starting from a pre-trained LLM, we approximate this target distribution using the $\u03b1$-divergence family, which unifies prior approaches and enables direct control of the precision-diversity trade-off by interpolating between mode-seeking and mass-covering divergences. On a Lean theorem-proving benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance along the coverage-precision Pareto frontier, outperforming all prior methods on the coverage axis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u03b1-\u6563\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316LLM\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u65f6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3aRL\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\"\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bfb\u6c42\"\u7684Reverse KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u533a\u57df\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u5176\u4ed6\u533a\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u663e\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u51fa\u53d1\uff08\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u4f46\u4fdd\u7559\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6982\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u03b1-\u6563\u5ea6\u65cf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8be5\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d2\u503c\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bfb\u6c42\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u8986\u76d6\u6563\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6743\u8861\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728Lean\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u7387-\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u8f74\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u03b1-\u6563\u5ea6\u65cf\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u7b49\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Our approach combines a lightweight U-Net transfer encoder with a diffusion-based generative model. The simpler U-Net is first pretrained on a long time series of coarse resolution data to learn spatiotemporal representations; its encoder is then frozen and transferred to a larger downscaling model as physically meaningful latent features. Our application uses NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis as the low resolution source domain (50 km) and the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) as the high resolution target (7 km). Our study area included a large area in Asia, which was made computationally tractable by splitting into two subregions and four seasons. We conducted domain similarity analysis using Wasserstein distances confirmed minimal distributional shift between MERRA-2 and G5NR, validating the safety of parameter frozen transfer. Across seasonal regional splits, our model achieved excellent performance (R2 = 0.65 to 0.94), outperforming comparison models including deterministic U-Nets, variational autoencoders, and prior transfer learning baselines. Out of data evaluations using semivariograms, ACF/PACF, and lag-based RMSE/R2 demonstrated that the predicted downscaled images preserved physically consistent spatial variability and temporal autocorrelation, enabling stable autoregressive reconstruction beyond the G5NR record. These results show that transfer enhanced diffusion models provide a robust and physically coherent solution for downscaling a long time series of coarse resolution images with limited training periods.

We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\\bf Q}$ and ${\\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness.

The associated transfer operator $P: L^2(M,\u03bc) \\to L^2(M,\u03bc)$ encodes the propagation of semantic mass. Under mild regularity assumptions (compactness, ergodicity, bounded Jacobian), $P$ is compact with discrete spectrum. Within this setting, we prove the Semantic Characterization Theorem (SCT): the leading eigenfunctions of $P$ induce finitely many spectral basins of invariant meaning, each definable in an o-minimal structure over $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus spectral lumpability and logical tameness coincide. This explains how discrete symbolic semantics can emerge from continuous computation: the continuous activation manifold collapses into a finite, logically interpretable ontology.

We propose a key principle for compositing image latents: Pixel-Equivalent Latent Compositing (PELC). An equivalent latent compositor should be the same as compositing in pixel space. This principle enables full-resolution mask control and true soft-edge alpha compositing, even though VAEs compress images 8x spatially. Modern VAEs capture global context beyond patch-aligned local structure, so linear latent blending cannot be pixel-equivalent: it produces large artifacts at mask seams and global degradation and color shifts. We introduce DecFormer, a 7.7M-parameter transformer that predicts per-channel blend weights and an off-manifold residual correction to realize mask-consistent latent fusion. DecFormer is trained so that decoding after fusion matches pixel-space alpha compositing, is plug-compatible with existing diffusion pipelines, requires no backbone finetuning and adds only 0.07% of FLUX.1-Dev's parameters and 3.5% FLOP overhead. On the FLUX.1 family, DecFormer restores global color consistency, soft-mask support, sharp boundaries, and high-fidelity masking, reducing error metrics around edges by up to 53% over standard mask interpolation. Used as an inpainting prior, a lightweight LoRA on FLUX.1-Dev with DecFormer achieves fidelity comparable to FLUX.1-Fill, a fully finetuned inpainting model.

Yet experimental annotation lags far behind the rapid growth of protein sequence data. Computational approaches address this gap by associating proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which encode functional knowledge through hierarchical relations and textual definitions. However, existing models often emphasize one modality over the other, limiting their ability to generalize, particularly to unseen or newly introduced GO terms that frequently arise as the ontology evolves, and making the previously trained models outdated. We present STAR-GO, a Transformer-based framework that jointly models the semantic and structural characteristics of GO terms to enhance zero-shot protein function prediction. STAR-GO integrates textual definitions with ontology graph structure to learn unified GO representations, which are processed in hierarchical order to propagate information from general to specific terms. These representations are then aligned with protein sequence embeddings to capture sequence-function relationships. STAR-GO achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior zero-shot generalization, demonstrating the utility of integrating semantics and structure for robust and adaptable protein function prediction.

Existing sampling algorithms typically require many iterative steps to produce high-quality samples, leading to high computational costs. We introduce one-step diffusion samplers which learn a step-conditioned ODE so that one large step reproduces the trajectory of many small ones via a state-space consistency loss. We further show that standard ELBO estimates in diffusion samplers degrade in the few-step regime because common discrete integrators yield mismatched forward/backward transition kernels. Motivated by this analysis, we derive a deterministic-flow (DF) importance weight for ELBO estimation without a backward kernel. To calibrate DF, we introduce a volume-consistency regularization that aligns the accumulated volume change along the flow across step resolutions. Our proposed sampler therefore achieves both sampling and stable evidence estimate in only one or few steps. Across challenging synthetic and Bayesian benchmarks, it achieves competitive sample quality with orders-of-magnitude fewer network evaluations while maintaining robust ELBO estimates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u5b66\u4e60\u6b65\u957f\u6761\u4ef6ODE\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6d41\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u4f53\u79ef\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bc1\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b65\u9aa4\u624d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5728\u5c11\u6b65\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6807\u51c6ELBO\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f1a\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u5bfc\u81f4\u524d\u5411/\u540e\u5411\u8f6c\u79fb\u6838\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "1. \u5b66\u4e60\u6b65\u957f\u6761\u4ef6ODE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u4f7f\u4e00\u5927\u6b65\u590d\u5236\u591a\u4e2a\u5c0f\u6b65\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b2. \u63a8\u5bfc\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6d41\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u7528\u4e8eELBO\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u540e\u5411\u6838\uff1b3. \u5f15\u5165\u4f53\u79ef\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6821\u51c6DF\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u957f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u6cbf\u6d41\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u4f53\u79ef\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5408\u6210\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684ELBO\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4ec5\u4e00\u6b65\u6216\u5c11\u6570\u51e0\u6b65\u5185\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bc1\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

This scarcity introduces epistemic uncertainty, i.e., reducible uncertainty stemming from incomplete knowledge of the underlying data distribution, which fundamentally limits predictive performance. This review paper examines formal methodologies that address data-limited regimes through two complementary approaches: quantifying epistemic uncertainty and mitigating data scarcity via synthetic data augmentation. We begin by reviewing generalized Bayesian learning frameworks that characterize epistemic uncertainty through generalized posteriors in the model parameter space, as well as ``post-Bayes'' learning frameworks. We continue by presenting information-theoretic generalization bounds that formalize the relationship between training data quantity and predictive uncertainty, providing a theoretical justification for generalized Bayesian learning. Moving beyond methods with asymptotic statistical validity, we survey uncertainty quantification methods that provide finite-sample statistical guarantees, including conformal prediction and conformal risk control. Finally, we examine recent advances in data efficiency by combining limited labeled data with abundant model predictions or synthetic data.

Prior work shows strong impossibility results, e.g. that even under natural assumptions, no aggregation of the experts' individual forecasts can outperform simply following a random expert (Neyman and Roughgarden, 2022).\n  In this paper, we introduce a more general framework that allows the principal to elicit richer information from experts through structured queries. Our framework ensures that experts will truthfully report their underlying beliefs, and also enables us to define notions of complexity over the difficulty of asking these queries. Under a general model of independent but overlapping expert signals, we show that optimal aggregation is achievable in the worst case with each complexity measure bounded above by the number of agents $n$. We further establish tight tradeoffs between accuracy and query complexity: aggregation error decreases linearly with the number of queries, and vanishes when the \"order of reasoning\" and number of agents relevant to a query is $\u03c9(\\sqrt{n})$. These results demonstrate that modest extensions to the space of expert queries dramatically strengthen the power of robust forecast aggregation. We therefore expect that our new query framework will open up a fruitful line of research in this area.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u9884\u6d4b\u805a\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u4ece\u4e13\u5bb6\u5904\u83b7\u53d6\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u968f\u673a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u805a\u5408\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u805a\u5408\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff08Neyman\u548cRoughgarden\uff0c2022\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5bfb\u6c42\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u805a\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4e3b\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u4ece\u4e13\u5bb6\u5904\u83b7\u53d6\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u786e\u4fdd\u4e13\u5bb6\u4f1a\u5982\u5b9e\u62a5\u544a\u5176\u5e95\u5c42\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u4fe1\u53f7\u72ec\u7acb\u4f46\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u90fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u6570\u91cfn\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u805a\u5408\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u91cf\u7ebf\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u5f53\"\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6570\"\u548c\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6570\u91cf\u4e3a\u03c9(\u221an)\u65f6\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u67e5\u8be2\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u9884\u6d4b\u805a\u5408\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u671b\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5f00\u8f9f\u5bcc\u6709\u6210\u679c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While the research community has made significant progress in WebShell detection (i.e., distinguishing malicious samples from benign ones), we argue that it is time to transition from passive detection to in-depth analysis and proactive defense. One promising direction is the automation of WebShell family classification, which involves identifying the specific malware lineage in order to understand an adversary's tactics and enable a precise, rapid response. This crucial task, however, remains a largely unexplored area that currently relies on slow, manual expert analysis. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study to automate WebShell family classification. Our method begins with extracting dynamic function call traces to capture inherent behaviors that are resistant to common encryption and obfuscation. To enhance the scale and diversity of our dataset for a more stable evaluation, we augment these real-world traces with new variants synthesized by Large Language Models. These augmented traces are then abstracted into sequences, graphs, and trees, providing a foundation to benchmark a comprehensive suite of representation methods.

We study this problem in a controlled setting using the CoT-ICL Lab framework, and propose meta-training techniques to learn novel abstract reasoning tasks in-context. Although CoT examples facilitate reasoning, we noticed that their excessive inclusion during meta-training degrades performance when CoT supervision is limited. To mitigate such behavior, we propose CoT-Recipe, a formal approach to modulate the mix of CoT and non-CoT examples in meta-training sequences. We demonstrate that careful modulation via CoT-Recipe can increase the accuracy of transformers on novel tasks by up to 300% even when there are no CoT examples available in-context.

This wastes inference-time compute and can hurt accuracy. Existing attempts to stop early either manipulate decoding with extra sampling and heuristics, rely on auxiliary verifier models, or operate only as post-hoc analysis pipelines without formal guarantees. We introduce LYNX, an online early-exit mechanism that turns a model's own hidden-state awareness into confidence-controlled stopping decisions. LYNX attaches exit decisions to naturally occurring reasoning cues (e.g., \"hmm\", \"wait\") during generation, trains a lightweight probe on hidden states at those cue tokens using supervision from forced exits, and wraps the resulting scores in split conformal prediction to obtain distribution-free control over premature exits. Crucially, we train and calibrate this probe once on a generic mathematical corpus and reuse it unchanged across benchmarks, decoding temperatures, and even non-mathematical tasks. Across three model families spanning 1.5B to 32B parameters, a single mathematically trained probe per base model yields strong accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On GSM8K, LYNX matches or improves baseline accuracy while reducing tokens by 40--65\\%; on MATH-500 it improves accuracy by up to 12 points with roughly 35--60\\% fewer tokens; on AIME 2024 it recovers baseline accuracy with more than 50\\% token savings; and on CommonsenseQA, a non-math benchmark, it transfers zero-shot with modest accuracy gains and up to 70\\% fewer tokens.

Training in a symmetric-log domain ensures numerical stability. Evaluated on a reproducible FDTD benchmark (200 unique simulations, structure-wise split), FieldSeer I achieves higher suffix fidelity than GRU and deterministic baselines across three practical settings: (i) software-in-the-loop filtering (64x64, P=80->Q=80), (ii) offline single-file rollouts (80x140, P=240->Q=40), and (iii) offline multi-structure rollouts (80x140, P=180->Q=100).

Object verification has relied heavily on human eyes, which usually results in significant labor costs. In order to address this limitation and reduce the reliance on manual intervention, we propose a multi-input convolutional neural network integrated with a convolutional block attention module. This method is specifically tailored to enhance the moving object detection system that we have developed and used previously. The current method introduces two innovations. This first one is a multi-input architecture that processes multiple stacked images simultaneously. The second is the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module which enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions. These advancements facilitate efficient learning from multiple inputs, leading to more robust detection of moving objects. The performance of the model is evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 2,000 observational images. We achieved an accuracy of nearly 99% with AUC (an Area Under the Curve) of >0.99.

While music information retrieval and computational musicology have explored structured and multimodal understanding, few resources support factual and contextual music question answering (MQA) grounded in artist metadata or historical context. We introduce MusWikiDB, a vector database of 3.2M passages from 144K music-related Wikipedia pages, and ArtistMus, a benchmark of 1,000 questions on 500 diverse artists with metadata such as genre, debut year, and topic. These resources enable systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for MQA. Experiments show that RAG markedly improves factual accuracy; open-source models gain up to +56.8 percentage points (for example, Qwen3 8B improves from 35.0 to 91.8), approaching proprietary model performance. RAG-style fine-tuning further boosts both factual recall and contextual reasoning, improving results on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. MusWikiDB also yields approximately 6 percentage points higher accuracy and 40% faster retrieval than a general-purpose Wikipedia corpus. We release MusWikiDB and ArtistMus to advance research in music information retrieval and domain-specific question answering, establishing a foundation for retrieval-augmented reasoning in culturally rich domains such as music.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86MusWikiDB\u97f3\u4e50\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548cArtistMus\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u5728\u97f3\u4e50\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aRAG\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u97f3\u4e50\u76f8\u5173\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u97f3\u4e50\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a00\u758f\u3002\u867d\u7136\u97f3\u4e50\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u97f3\u4e50\u5b66\u5df2\u7ecf\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u4e8e\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5386\u53f2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u97f3\u4e50\u95ee\u7b54\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efaMusWikiDB\uff1a\u5305\u542b144K\u97f3\u4e50\u76f8\u5173\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u9875\u9762\u7684320\u4e07\u6bb5\u843d\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\n2. \u521b\u5efaArtistMus\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u5305\u542b500\u4f4d\u591a\u6837\u5316\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u76841000\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9644\u5e26\u6d41\u6d3e\u3001\u51fa\u9053\u5e74\u4efd\u7b49\u5143\u6570\u636e\n3. \u4f7f\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u97f3\u4e50\u95ee\u7b54\u8bc4\u4f30\n4. \u8fdb\u884cRAG\u98ce\u683c\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u5fc6\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "result": "1.

A Modern Look at Drawing Inference with Predicted Data", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "comment": "32 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables", "summary": "As artificial intelligence and machine learning tools become more accessible, and scientists face new obstacles to data collection (e.g., rising costs, declining survey response rates), researchers increasingly use predictions from pre-trained algorithms as substitutes for missing or unobserved data. Though appealing for financial and logistical reasons, using standard tools for inference can misrepresent the association between independent variables and the outcome of interest when the true, unobserved outcome is replaced by a predicted value. In this paper, we characterize the statistical challenges inherent to drawing inference with predicted data (IPD) and show that high predictive accuracy does not guarantee valid downstream inference. We show that all such failures reduce to statistical notions of (i) bias, when predictions systematically shift the estimand or distort relationships among variables, and (ii) variance, when uncertainty from the prediction model and the intrinsic variability of the true data are ignored. We then review recent methods for conducting IPD and discuss how this framework is deeply rooted in classical statistical theory. We then comment on some open questions and interesting avenues for future work in this area, and end with some comments on how to use predicted data in scientific studies that is both transparent and statistically principled.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u505a\u63a8\u65ad\uff08IPD\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u5f52\u7ed3\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI/ML\u5de5\u5177\u66f4\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u9762\u4e34\u65b0\u969c\u788d\uff08\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u3001\u8c03\u67e5\u54cd\u5e94\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\uff08IPD\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5f52\u7ed3\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6539\u53d8\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u6216\u626d\u66f2\u53d8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\uff08\u5ffd\u7565\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5185\u5728\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff09\u4e24\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u6709IPD\u95ee\u9898\u90fd\u53ef\u5f52\u7ed3\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u7edf\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u73b0\u6709IPD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u8c28\u614e\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

Artifact classification offers advantages in stability and transparency, providing a viable alternative to ICA-based methods that enable flexible use alongside human inspections and across various applications. However, artifact classification is limited by its training data as it requires extensive manual labeling, which cannot fully cover the diversity of real-world EEG. Semi-synthetic data (SSD) methods have been proposed to address this limitation, but prior approaches typically injected single artifact types using ICA components or required separately recorded artifact signals, reducing both the realism of the generated data and the applicability of the method. To overcome these issues, we introduce SSDLabeler, a framework that generates realistic, annotated SSDs by decomposing real EEG with ICA, epoch-level artifact verification using RMS and PSD criteria, and reinjecting multiple artifact types into clean data. When applied to train a multi-label artifact classifier, it improved accuracy on raw EEG across diverse conditions compared to prior SSD and raw EEG training, establishing a scalable foundation for artifact handling that captures the co-occurrence and complexity of real EEG.", "AI": {"tldr": "SSDLabeler\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7ICA\u5206\u89e3\u771f\u5b9eEEG\u3001RMS/PSD\u6807\u51c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f2a\u8ff9\u3001\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u4f2a\u8ff9\u7c7b\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u6ce8\u5165\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u534a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u4f2a\u8ff9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u539f\u59cbEEG\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "EEG\u8bb0\u5f55\u56fa\u6709\u5730\u53d7\u5230\u773c\u52a8\u3001\u808c\u8089\u548c\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u4f2a\u8ff9\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfICA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u4f2a\u8ff9\u5206\u7c7b\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u771f\u5b9eEEG\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u534a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u6ce8\u5165\u5355\u4e00\u4f2a\u8ff9\u7c7b\u578b\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5355\u72ec\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u4f2a\u8ff9\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSSDLabeler\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528ICA\u5206\u89e3\u771f\u5b9eEEG\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eRMS\u548cPSD\u6807\u51c6\u8fdb\u884cepoch\u7ea7\u4f2a\u8ff9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b3\uff09\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u4f2a\u8ff9\u7c7b\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u6ce8\u5165\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u534a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff1b4\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u4f2a\u8ff9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u7684\u534a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u539f\u59cbEEG\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cSSDLabeler\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4f2a\u8ff9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u539f\u59cbEEG\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9eEEG\u4e2d\u4f2a\u8ff9\u7684\u5171\u73b0\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SSDLabeler\u4e3a\u4f2a\u8ff9\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u534a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f2a\u8ff9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u771f\u5b9eEEG\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, effective MSA is challenged by alignment and fusion issues. Alignment requires synchronizing both temporal and semantic information across modalities, while fusion involves integrating these aligned features into a unified representation. Existing methods often address alignment or fusion in isolation, leading to limitations in performance and efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion (DashFusion). Firstly, dual-stream alignment module synchronizes multimodal features through temporal and semantic alignment. Temporal alignment employs cross-modal attention to establish frame-level correspondences among multimodal sequences. Semantic alignment ensures consistency across the feature space through contrastive learning. Secondly, supervised contrastive learning leverages label information to refine the modality features. Finally, hierarchical bottleneck fusion progressively integrates multimodal information through compressed bottleneck tokens, which achieves a balance between performance and computational efficiency. We evaluate DashFusion on three datasets: CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS. Experimental results demonstrate that DashFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our alignment and fusion techniques.

LLMs require few, if any, training examples and can be utilized by users without expertise in model development. However, this comes at the cost of substantially higher resource and energy consumption compared to smaller models, which often achieve similar predictive performance for simple tasks. In this paper, we present our vision for just-in-time model replacement (JITR), where, upon identifying a recurring task in calls to an LLM, the model is replaced transparently with a cheaper alternative that performs well for this specific task. JITR retains the ease of use and low development effort of LLMs, while saving significant cost and energy. We discuss the main challenges in realizing our vision regarding the identification of recurring tasks and the creation of a custom model. Specifically, we argue that model search and transfer learning will play a crucial role in JITR to efficiently identify and fine-tune models for a recurring task.

While visual arts such as painting and architecture have been studied through eye tracking, revealing distinct gaze patterns between experts and novices, analogous methods for auditory art forms remain underdeveloped. Music, despite being a pervasive component of modern life and culture, still lacks objective tools to quantify listeners' attention and perceptual focus during natural listening experiences. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to decode selective attention to musical elements using naturalistic, studio-produced songs and a lightweight consumer-grade EEG device with only four electrodes. By analyzing neural responses during real world like music listening, we test whether decoding is feasible under conditions that minimize participant burden and preserve the authenticity of the musical experience. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) decoding music attention in real studio-produced songs, (ii) demonstrating feasibility with a four-channel consumer EEG, (iii) providing insights for music attention decoding, and (iv) demonstrating improved model ability over prior work. Our findings suggest that musical attention can be decoded not only for novel songs but also across new subjects, showing performance improvements compared to existing approaches under our tested conditions. These findings show that consumer-grade devices can reliably capture signals, and that neural decoding in music could be feasible in real-world settings.

Conditioning on the data and averaging over a design measure \u03bc, we formalize \u03bc-coverage for central intervals and \u03bc-probabilistic calibration through randomized probability integral transforms. We introduce two methods. cps-gp adapts conformal predictive systems to GP interpolation using standardized leave-one-out residuals, yielding stepwise predictive distributions with finite-sample marginal calibration. bcr-gp retains the GP posterior mean and replaces the Gaussian residual by a generalized normal model fitted to cross-validated standardized residuals. A Bayesian selection rule-based either on a posterior upper quantile of the variance for conservative prediction or on a cross-posterior Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion for probabilistic calibration-controls dispersion and tail behavior while producing smooth predictive distributions suitable for sequential design. Numerical experiments on benchmark functions compare cps-gp, bcr-gp, Jackknife+ for GPs, and the full conformal Gaussian process, using calibration metrics (coverage, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, integral absolute error) and accuracy or sharpness through the scaled continuous ranked probability score.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u63d2\u503c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1acps-gp\u548cbcr-gp\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fb9\u9645\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u63d2\u503c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fb9\u9645\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) cps-gp\uff1a\u5c06\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9002\u5e94\u4e8eGP\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7559\u4e00\u6b8b\u5dee\uff1b2) bcr-gp\uff1a\u4fdd\u7559GP\u540e\u9a8c\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u7528\u62df\u5408\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6b8b\u5dee\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u6b63\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362\u9ad8\u65af\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\u63a7\u5236\u79bb\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0ccps-gp\u548cbcr-gp\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u6307\u6807\uff08\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3001Kolmogorov-Smirnov\u3001\u79ef\u5206\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eJackknife+ for GPs\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u4fdd\u5f62\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "cps-gp\u548cbcr-gp\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8fb9\u9645\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u987a\u5e8f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing semantic alignment methods typically rely on additional digital processing at the transmitter or receiver, increasing overall device complexity. In this work, we introduce the first over-the-air semantic alignment framework based on stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM), which enables latent-space alignment directly in the wave domain, reducing substantially the computational burden at the device level. We model SIMs as trainable linear operators capable of emulating both supervised linear aligners and zero-shot Parseval-frame-based equalizers. To realize these operators physically, we develop a gradient-based optimization procedure that tailors the metasurface transfer function to a desired semantic mapping. Experiments with heterogeneous vision transformer (ViT) encoders show that SIMs can accurately reproduce both supervised and zero-shot semantic equalizers, achieving up to 90% task accuracy in regimes with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while maintaining strong robustness even at low SNR values.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5806\u53e0\u667a\u80fd\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6ce2\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bbe\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5", "motivation": "\u5f02\u6784\u6536\u53d1\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u6570\u5b57\u5904\u7406\u589e\u52a0\u8bbe\u5907\u590d\u6742\u5ea6", "method": "\u5c06SIM\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u76d1\u7763\u7ebf\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u5668\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672cParseval\u6846\u67b6\u5747\u8861\u5668\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b9a\u5236\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u4f20\u9012\u51fd\u6570", "result": "SIM\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u590d\u73b0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5747\u8861\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u8fbe\u523090%\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "conclusion": "SIM\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6ce2\u57df\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bbe\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

While these models differ in the architecture and the dataset used, they share the ability to compress a staggering amount of chemical information into descriptive latent features. Herein, we systematically analyze what the different uMLIPs have learned by quantitatively assessing the relative information content of their latent features with feature reconstruction errors as metrics, and observing how the trends are affected by the choice of training set and training protocol. We find that the uMLIPs encode chemical space in significantly distinct ways, with substantial cross-model feature reconstruction errors. When variants of the same model architecture are considered, trends become dependent on the dataset, target, and training protocol of choice. We also observe that fine-tuning of a uMLIP retains a strong pre-training bias in the latent features. Finally, we discuss how atom-level features, which are directly output by MLIPs, can be compressed into global structure-level features via concatenation of progressive cumulants, each adding significantly new information about the variability across the atomic environments within a given system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\uff08uMLIPs\uff09\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u606f\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u4ecd\u4fdd\u7559\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u538b\u7f29\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\uff08uMLIPs\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5316\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ec4\u6210\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fd1\u4f3c\u57fa\u6001\u52bf\u80fd\u9762\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u5927\u91cf\u5316\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\u5230\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e0d\u540cuMLIPs\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540cuMLIPs\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u9009\u62e9\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u5c06\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540cuMLIPs\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u76f8\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u3002\u5fae\u8c03uMLIPs\u65f6\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u4ecd\u4fdd\u7559\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540cuMLIPs\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u538b\u7f29\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u539f\u5b50\u73af\u5883\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

KANFormer combines a Dilated Causal Convolutional network with a Transformer encoder, enhanced by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which improve nonlinear approximation. Unlike existing models that rely solely on a series of snapshots of the limit order book, KANFormer integrates the actions of agents related to LOB dynamics and the position of the order in the queue to more effectively capture patterns related to execution likelihood. We evaluate the model using CAC 40 index futures data with labeled orders. The results show that KANFormer outperforms existing works in both calibration (Right-Censored Log-Likelihood, Integrated Brier Score) and discrimination (C-index, time-dependent AUC). We further analyze feature importance over time using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

Chang"], "title": "The Missing Layer of AGI: From Pattern Alchemy to Coordination Physics", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "comment": "13 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Influential critiques argue that Large Language Models (LLMs) are a dead end for AGI: \"mere pattern matchers\" structurally incapable of reasoning or planning. We argue this conclusion misidentifies the bottleneck: it confuses the ocean with the net. Pattern repositories are the necessary System-1 substrate; the missing component is a System-2 coordination layer that selects, constrains, and binds these patterns. We formalize this layer via UCCT, a theory of semantic anchoring that models reasoning as a phase transition governed by effective support (rho_d), representational mismatch (d_r), and an adaptive anchoring budget (gamma log k). Under this lens, ungrounded generation is simply an unbaited retrieval of the substrate's maximum likelihood prior, while \"reasoning\" emerges when anchors shift the posterior toward goal-directed constraints. We translate UCCT into architecture with MACI, a coordination stack that implements baiting (behavior-modulated debate), filtering (Socratic judging), and persistence (transactional memory).

However, transforming the resulting high-dimensional data into interpretable deformation pattern maps remains a resource-intensive and largely manual process. In this work, we introduce a data-driven workflow that automates this interpretation step using unsupervised and supervised learning. Grain-orientation-colored computational tomograph pictures obtained from CuNi alloy simulations were first compressed through an autoencoder to a 32-dimensional global feature vector. Despite this strong compression, the reconstructed images retained the essential microstructural motifs: grain boundaries, stacking faults, twins, and partial lattice rotations, while omitting only the finest defects. The learned representations were then combined with simulation metadata (composition, load, time, temperature, and spatial position) to train a CNN-MLP model to predict the dominant deformation pattern. The resulting model achieves a prediction accuracy of approximately 96% on validation data. A refined evaluation strategy, in which an entire spatial region containing distinct grains was excluded from training, provides a more robust measure of generalization. The approach demonstrates that essential tribological deformation signatures can be automatically identified and classified from structural images using Machine Learning. This proof of concept constitutes a first step towards fully automated, data-driven construction of tribological mechanism maps and, ultimately, toward predictive modeling frameworks that may reduce the need for large-scale MD simulation campaigns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6469\u64e6\u53d8\u5f62\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CNN-MLP\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f62\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe96%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6469\u64e6\u53d8\u5f62\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u6a21\u5f0f\u56fe\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06CuNi\u5408\u91d1\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6676\u7c92\u53d6\u5411\u5f69\u8272\u8ba1\u7b97\u65ad\u5c42\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a32\u7ef4\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\uff1b2. \u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff08\u6210\u5206\u3001\u8f7d\u8377\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\uff1b3. \u8bad\u7ec3CNN-MLP\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u53d8\u5f62\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b4. \u91c7\u7528\u6392\u9664\u6574\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "1. \u5373\u4f7f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5f3a\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\u4ecd\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6676\u754c\u3001\u5806\u579b\u5c42\u9519\u3001\u5b6a\u6676\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u6676\u683c\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2. \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea696%\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b3. \u6392\u9664\u8bad\u7ec3\u533a\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6469\u64e6\u53d8\u5f62\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6469\u64e6\u673a\u5236\u56fe\u8fc8\u51fa\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u53ef\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Accurate postoperative facial appearance prediction remains challenging due to the complex nonlinear interactions between skeletal movements and facial soft tissue. Existing biomechanical, parametric models and deep-learning approaches either lack computational efficiency or fail to fully capture these intricate interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model (NICE) which employs implicit neural representations for accurate anatomical reconstruction and surgical outcome prediction. NICE comprises a shape module, which employs region-specific implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) decoders to reconstruct the facial surface, maxilla, and mandible, and a surgery module, which employs region-specific deformation decoders. These deformation decoders are driven by a shared surgical latent code to effectively model the complex, nonlinear biomechanical response of the facial surface to skeletal movements, incorporating anatomical prior knowledge.

The design problem we study is the placement of sensors to monitor spatiotemporal processes, explicitly accounting for the temporal dimension in our modeling and optimization. We observe that recent advancements in computational sciences often yield large datasets based on physics-based simulations, which are rarely leveraged in experimental design. We introduce a novel model-based sensor placement criterion, along with a highly-efficient optimization algorithm, which integrates physics-based simulations and Bayesian experimental design principles to identify sensor networks that \"minimize information loss\" from simulated data. Our technique relies on sparse variational inference and (separable) Gauss-Markov priors, and thus may adapt many techniques from Bayesian experimental design. We validate our method through a case study monitoring air temperature in Phoenix, Arizona, using state-of-the-art physics-based simulations.

While reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods traditionally rely on global kernel regressors, it is also common to use a smoothness-based approach that exploits local approximations. We show that these perspectives are deeply connected through the spectral properties of isotropic kernels. In particular, we characterize the Fourier spectra of the Mat\u00e9rn, square-exponential, rational-quadratic, $\u03b3$-exponential, piecewise-polynomial, and Dirichlet kernels, and show that the decay rate determines asymptotic regret from both viewpoints. For kernelized bandit algorithms, spectral decay yields upper bounds on the maximum information gain, governing worst-case regret, while for smoothness-based methods, the same decay rates establish H\u00f6lder space embeddings and Besov space norm-equivalences, enabling local continuity analysis. These connections show that kernel-based and locally adaptive algorithms can be analyzed within a unified framework. This allows us to derive explicit regret bounds for each kernel family, obtaining novel results in several cases and providing improved analysis for others. Furthermore, we analyze LP-GP-UCB, an algorithm that combines both approaches, augmenting global Gaussian process surrogates with local polynomial estimators. While the hybrid approach does not uniformly dominate specialized methods, it achieves order-optimality across multiple kernel families.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u4e0eRKHS\u51fd\u6570bandit\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5LP-GP-UCB\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRKHS\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u89c6\u89d2\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u7684\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3abandit\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Mat\u00e9rn\u3001\u5e73\u65b9\u6307\u6570\u3001\u6709\u7406\u4e8c\u6b21\u3001\u03b3-\u6307\u6570\u3001\u5206\u6bb5\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u548cDirichlet\u6838\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u8c31\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u8c31\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6838\u5316bandit\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8c31\u8870\u51cf\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86H\u00f6lder\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u548cBesov\u7a7a\u95f4\u8303\u6570\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684LP-GP-UCB\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6838\u65cf\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u6790\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5LP-GP-UCB\u867d\u7136\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u95e8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6838\u65cf\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u9636\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6838\u7684\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u5168\u5c40\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6838\u65cf\u4e0a\u90fd\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3abandit\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite their impressive effectiveness in many areas, RAG systems based solely on semantic similarity often fail to ensure factual accuracy in specialized domains, where terminological ambiguity can affect retrieval relevance. This study proposes an enhanced RAG architecture that integrates a factual signal derived from Entity Linking to improve the accuracy of educational question-answering systems in Italian. The system includes a Wikidata-based Entity Linking module and implements three re-ranking strategies to combine semantic and entity-based information: a hybrid score weighting model, reciprocal rank fusion, and a cross-encoder re-ranker. Experiments were conducted on two benchmarks: a custom academic dataset and the standard SQuAD-it dataset. Results show that, in domain-specific contexts, the hybrid schema based on reciprocal rank fusion significantly outperforms both the baseline and the cross-encoder approach, while the cross-encoder achieves the best results on the general-domain dataset. These findings confirm the presence of an effect of domain mismatch and highlight the importance of domain adaptation and hybrid ranking strategies to enhance factual precision and reliability in retrieval-augmented generation. They also demonstrate the potential of entity-aware RAG systems in educational environments, fostering adaptive and reliable AI-based tutoring tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u7684RAG\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u6559\u80b2\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u60e0\u6392\u540d\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728LLM\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0cRAG\u67b6\u6784\u56e0\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u77e5\u8bc6\u6e90\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5e38\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u672f\u8bed\u6b67\u4e49\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u7684RAG\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u57fa\u4e8eWikidata\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e09\u79cd\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\uff1a1) \u6df7\u5408\u5206\u6570\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u4e92\u60e0\u6392\u540d\u878d\u5408\uff1b3) \u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u3002\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b66\u672f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6807\u51c6SQuAD-it\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u60e0\u6392\u540d\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6392\u540d\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u4f53\u611f\u77e5RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u8f85\u5bfc\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
