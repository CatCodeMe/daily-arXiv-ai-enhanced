In this work, we address\nthese challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens.

A graph is $k$-planar if it admits a drawing in the plane in which\neach edge is crossed at most $k$ times. The local crossing number of a graph is\nthe minimum integer $k$ such that it is $k$-planar. The problem of determining\nwhether an input graph is $1$-planar is known to be NP-complete even for\nnear-planar graphs [Cabello and Mohar, SIAM J. Comput. 2013], that is, the\ngraphs obtained from planar graphs by adding a single edge. Moreover, the local\ncrossing number is hard to approximate within a factor $2 - \\varepsilon$ for\nany $\\varepsilon > 0$ [Urschel and Wellens, IPL 2021]. To address this\ncomputational intractability, Bannister, Cabello, and Eppstein [JGAA 2018]\ninvestigated the parameterized complexity of the case of $k = 1$, particularly\nfocusing on structural parameterizations on input graphs, such as treedepth,\nvertex cover number, and feedback edge number. In this paper, we extend their\napproach by considering the general case $k \\ge 1$ and give (tight)\nparameterized upper and lower bound results. In particular, we strengthen the\naforementioned lower bound results to subclasses of constant-treewidth graphs:\nwe show that testing $1$-planarity is NP-complete even for near-planar graphs\nwith feedback vertex set number at most $3$ and pathwidth at most $4$, and the\nlocal crossing number is hard to approximate within any constant factor for\ngraphs with feedback vertex set number at most $2$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86k-\u5e73\u9762\u6027\uff08k-planarity\uff09\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u5bf9k=1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86k\u22651\u65f6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5b50\u7c7b\u56fe\u4e2d1-\u5e73\u9762\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684NP\u5b8c\u5168\u6027\u53ca\u5c40\u90e8\u4ea4\u53c9\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u56fe\u7684k-\u5e73\u9762\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4ea4\u53c9\u6570\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff08\u5982NP\u5b8c\u5168\u6027\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u96be\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Bannister\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8003\u8651k\u22651\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u53cd\u9988\u9876\u70b9\u96c6\u6570\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e861-\u5e73\u9762\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u53cd\u9988\u9876\u70b9\u96c6\u6570\u22643\u4e14\u8def\u5f84\u5bbd\u5ea6\u22644\u7684\u8fd1\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u4e2d\u4ecd\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u5c40\u90e8\u4ea4\u53c9\u6570\u5728\u53cd\u9988\u9876\u70b9\u96c6\u6570\u22642\u7684\u56fe\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u4ee5\u4efb\u4f55\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86k-\u5e73\u9762\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4ea4\u53c9\u6570\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

This\ndominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with\nperformance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms\nposes significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming\nparadigms and hardware architectures.

In these so-called brownfield software development\nsettings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like\nGitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the\nimpact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks\nremains underexplored.

We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10\nundergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield\ndevelopment tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a\nmixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and\nexit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 35% faster (p < 0.05)\nand made 50% more solution progress p (< 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover,\nour analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 11% less time\nmanually writing code (p < 0.05), and 12% less time conducting web searches (p\n< 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in\nprogramming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not\nunderstanding how or why Copilot suggestions work.

However, imbalanced pipeline workloads and complex data\ndependencies in the prefill and decode phases result in massive pipeline\nbubbles and further severe performance reduction. To better exploit the\npipeline parallelism for high-throughput LLM inference, we propose TD-Pipe,\nwith the key idea lies in the temporally-disaggregated pipeline parallelism\narchitecture. Specifically, this architecture disaggregates the prefill and\ndecode phases in the temporal dimension, so as to eliminate pipeline bubbles\ncaused by the phase switching. TD-Pipe identifies potential issues of\nexploiting the novel architecture and provides solutions. First, a\nhierarchy-controller structure is used to better coordinate devices in pipeline\nparallelism by decoupling the scheduling from execution. Second, the AI-based\ngreedy prefill approach aggressively performs more prefills by predicting the\noutput length and simulating the memory usage.

One drawback regarding this pure\ndecentralization is it introduces communication inefficiencies, which arise\nfrom increased message exchanges in large-scale setups.

Additionally, the distributed nature of\nthese frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy\nerror and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs\nremains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and\nroot causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component\ninteractions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal\ncode changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic\noptimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility\nhandling, indicating potential for automation.

It is also shown that the cost can decrease by up to a linear factor\nthis way, but in general, it is NP-hard to decide whether partial computations\nallow for a smaller cost in a specific DAG. We then discuss how $S$-partitions,\na crucial tool for deriving I/O lower bounds in RBP, can be adapted to the PRBP\nmodel.

Although recent advancements\nin Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for\nrepository-level repair tasks, current methodologies exhibit two notable\nlimitations: (1) they often address issues in isolation, neglecting to\nincorporate insights from previously resolved issues, and (2) they rely on\nstatic and rigid prompting strategies, which constrain their ability to\ngeneralize across diverse and evolving issue scenarios. Inspired by the dual\nmemory systems of human cognition, where episodic and semantic memories work\nsynergistically to support human reasoning and decision-making, we propose\nExpeRepair, a novel LLM-based approach that continuously learns from historical\nrepair experiences through dual-channel knowledge accumulation. ExpeRepair\norganizes historical repair experiences into two complementary memories: an\nepisodic memory that stores concrete repair demonstrations, and a semantic\nmemory that encodes abstract reflective insights. At inference time, ExpeRepair\nactivates both memory systems by retrieving relevant demonstrations from\nepisodic memory and recalling high-level repair insights from semantic memory.\nIt further enhances adaptability through dynamic prompt composition,\nsynergistically integrating both memory types to replace static prompts with\ncontext-aware, experience-driven prompts.

Dynamically selecting the\noptimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a\npromising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and\nperformance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive\nand often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on\nhuman-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in\nreal-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task\ndifficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that\ndynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically\nassessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using\nChain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into\nthree difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed\ndifficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best\nmodel for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental\nresults show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score\nwhile reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method\nComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an\napproximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of\ncost consumption.

However, how users perceive, evaluate, and\ncritique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the\noverwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first\ncomprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,\nleveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with\n894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a\nmulti-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and\nsystematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.\nEach stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and\nclustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables\nscalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million\naspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.\nOur analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:\npositive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized\nassistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,\nscanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language\nsupport.

As CPS grow in\ncomplexity and scale, particularly in safety-critical and learning-enabled\nsettings, accurate analysis and synthesis increasingly rely on the rapid use of\nsimulation experiments. Because CPS inherently integrate hardware, software,\nand physical processes, simulation platforms must support co-simulation of\nheterogeneous components at varying levels of fidelity. Despite recent advances\nin high-fidelity modeling of hardware, firmware, and physics, co-simulation in\ndiverse environments remains challenging. These limitations hinder the\ndevelopment of reusable benchmarks and impede the use of simulation for\nautomated and comparative evaluation.\n  Existing simulation tools often rely on rigid configurations, lack automation\nsupport, and present obstacles to portability and modularity.

In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated\npipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our\npipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce\nSWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment\nconstruction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a\ncollaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to\nenhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based\ngrading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.\nFinally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit\ncode signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show\nthat our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,\nwith GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per\ninstance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at\nthe lowest cost of $0.024 per instance.

However,\nthey typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while\noverlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating\nmultimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)\nis essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,\nand recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three\nparadigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.\nMLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via\nmultimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in\nlanguage or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor\ntreats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.\nDespite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly\nevaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been\nmade. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for\nmultimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms\nacross six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we\nobserve that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes\nbenefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment\nmodels (e.g., CLIP) as encoders.

However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from\nobserved progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data\nassimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex\ncoupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from\nmeasurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.\nIn this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from\nVIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height\ndata.

We propose a two-stage\npipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net\nbased segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping\nsignals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the\nprimary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into\na time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an\nadaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG\nformats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained\nsegmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior\nperformance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both\nnon-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping\nsignals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson\nCorrelation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,\nrespectively, for the baseline.

In this paper, we offer a new perspective on\nachieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established\ntechniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints\npenalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained\nRL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable\nactions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.\nFurthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through\npenalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely\nby an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This\nreformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving\nresilience to disturbances.

While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate\ndemographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail\nwhen realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures\nthrough internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive\nattribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction\nacross all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4\nSonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,\nMistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,\nculture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring\nconstraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\\%\") induces\nsignificant racial and gender biases (up to 12\\% differences in interview\nrates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White\ncandidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and\nscenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from\nsubtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible\neven when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning.

While prior work has primarily\nfocused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on\nunlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods\noften suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To\naddress this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And\nRetention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight\nproxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the\n\"alignment\" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally\nefficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that\nassigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely\nproportional to their proxy attribution scores.

Such fundamental\ndisparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from\nachieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in\nother fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural\nnetworks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate\ndeep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems.

Speech features included low level\nprosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions\n(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker\ndisplacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise\ndisplacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech\nfeatures to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently\nelicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness\nshowed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed\ngestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for\nprosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower\nand more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was\nenhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u4e2d\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u624b\u52bf\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u540c\u65f6\u6027\u8bed\u97f3\u5bf9\u60c5\u611f\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u9762\u90e8\u53ca\u624b\u52bf\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u4e2d\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u624b\u52bf\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u65f6\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u548cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528IEMOCAP\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u4eba\u4e92\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u97f3\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u97f5\u5f8b\u3001MFCCs\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u884d\u751f\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6307\u6807\uff09\u4e0e3D\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u624b\u90e8\u6807\u8bb0\u4f4d\u79fb\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u6d3b\u8dc3\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u8bed\u97f3\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u624b\u52bf\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u8bed\u97f3\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u624b\u90e8\u7684\u6d3b\u8dc3\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e0b\u8138\u548c\u5634\u90e8\uff1b\u60b2\u4f24\u5728\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u65f6\u8868\u8fbe\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u6124\u6012\u5219\u5728\u91cd\u53e0\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u624b\u52bf\uff1b\u97f5\u5f8b\u548cMFCCs\u5728\u53d1\u97f3\u533a\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u5524\u9192\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u4ef7\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\u4e14\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u540c\u65f6\u6027\u8bed\u97f3\u65f6\u3002"}}

As a result, treatment replanning is often required\nto maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual\nreplanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a\npatient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT\nreplanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality\nscore addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning\nprocess as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust\noptimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based\napproaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using\ntheir planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating\nanatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific\napproach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling\neffective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network\nand Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state\nrepresentations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.\nEvaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL\nagents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \\pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \\pm\n6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \\pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by\na human planner ($137.20 \\pm 5.58$).

Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing\nand sampling from the distribution of the next token.

However, obtaining annotations for\nintracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the\ntedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged\nas a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in\nvolumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that\nprimarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,\nwe propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary\nadvantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The\nLaplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance\ndetail precision through flexible feature mapping.

Pok\\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an\nextraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately\n$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,\ncombinatorial nature of team building in Pok\\'emon VGC causes optimal\nstrategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and\nthe opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance\nresearch on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides\ncritical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies\nhuman-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents\nand behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic\nmethods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle.

The demonstrated approach utilizes\nmultiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to\nestimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained\nfrom real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain\nand finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation\nperformed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted\nto include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on\ncontainers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The\nevaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,\nand object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain\npretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of\nfinetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over\nmultiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining\nthe relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,\nonly a subset of them can be used as input.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u5438\u76d8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ed3\u5e93\u7b49\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ece\u6742\u4e71\u5806\u4e2d\u6293\u53d6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f00\u653e\u7269\u54c1\u96c6\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528RGB\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u6293\u53d6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7269\u54c1\u6293\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6293\u53d6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u4ec5\u9700\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u5373\u53ef\u63a8\u65ad\u3002"}}

The code is available at\n  https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer", "summary": "Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges\nin addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data\nsimultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce\nexcessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),\nand introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize\nthe definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a\nModel-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal\nInference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a\nweight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,\nattention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level\nSelf-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a\nMultimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.\nTo tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate\nlabel and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and\nfine-grained counterfactual texts.

Traditional\nMonte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow\nconvergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the\ndimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we\nadopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity\nsolutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve\nsampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate\nmodels based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).\nThese deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical\nproperties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and\nasymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching\nthem with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our\nmethod achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical\nconsistency and asymptotic accuracy.

Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the\nimplicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the\nnuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix.

Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for\nautoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,\ncontradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we\npropose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,\nwhich realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.\nSpecifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with\nNested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency\ncomponents. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine\nmanner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels\nof detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token\nefficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on\nImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and\nSpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters.

Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit\nsolution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the\nsampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data\ndistribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a\nspecific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses\nregions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength\n$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.\nNotably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We\nalso show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation\n($\\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for\nboth $1$D and $2$D.

However, existing attention perturbation methods\nlack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be\napplied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where\nquality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer\nlevel down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads\ngovern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose \"HeadHunter\", a systematic framework for\niteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,\nenabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In\naddition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected\nhead's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to\ntune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only\nmitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but\nalso enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through\ncompositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale\nDiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,\ndemonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and\nstyle-specific guidance.
