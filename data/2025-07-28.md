### [1] [ApproxJoin: Approximate Matching for Efficient Verification in Fuzzy Set Similarity Join](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18891)
*Michael Mandulak,S M Ferdous,Sayan Ghosh,Mahantesh Halappanavar,George Slota*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: ApproxJoin提出了一种基于近似最大权重匹配算法的模糊集合相似性连接方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模糊集合相似性连接问题中因使用匈牙利算法导致的高验证成本问题。

Method: 应用三种近似匹配算法（Greedy、Locally Dominant和Paz Schwartzman）优化验证过程。

Result: 性能提升2-19倍，同时保持高准确率（99%召回率）。

Conclusion: ApproxJoin在模糊集合相似性连接中有效平衡了性能与精度。

Abstract: The set similarity join problem is a fundamental problem in data processing
and discovery, relying on exact similarity measures between sets. In the
presence of alterations, such as misspellings on string data, the fuzzy set
similarity join problem instead approximately matches pairs of elements based
on the maximum weighted matching of the bipartite graph representation of sets.
State-of-the-art methods within this domain improve performance through
efficient filtering methods within the filter-verify framework, primarily to
offset high verification costs induced by the usage of the Hungarian algorithm
- an optimal matching method. Instead, we directly target the verification
process to assess the efficacy of more efficient matching methods within
candidate pair pruning.
  We present ApproxJoin, the first work of its kind in applying approximate
maximum weight matching algorithms for computationally expensive fuzzy set
similarity join verification. We comprehensively test the performance of three
approximate matching methods: the Greedy, Locally Dominant and Paz Schwartzman
methods, and compare with the state-of-the-art approach using exact matching.
Our experimental results show that ApproxJoin yields performance improvements
of 2-19x the state-of-the-art with high accuracy (99% recall).

architectures, peer-to-peer data management, and blockchains, are provided,
along with practical recommendations for achieving enhanced data sharing and
regulatory compliance.

DBMS+LLM integration and identifies key future challenges. Specifically, we
categorize five representative architectural patterns based on their core
design principles, strengths, and trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we
further highlight several critical open challenges. We aim to provide a
systematic understanding of the current integration landscape and to outline
the unresolved issues that must be addressed to achieve scalable and efficient
integration of traditional data management and advanced language reasoning in
future intelligent applications.

*Fernando Orejas,Elvira Pino,Renzo Angles,E. Pasarella,Nikos Milonakis*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于定义图数据库中路径属性的形式化方法，用于限制导航查询的解数量，并支持定量属性（如长度或累积成本）作为查询过滤器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图数据库中路径查询的解数量过多问题，并支持更灵活的路径筛选。

Method: 通过操作语义定义新的查询语言构造，证明其与简单逻辑语义的兼容性，并分析其表达能力。

Result: 路径属性比寄存器自动机更具表达力，使用路径属性过滤的查询性能优于标准查询。

Conclusion: 新形式化方法有效提升了图数据库查询的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a formalism for defining properties of paths in graph
databases, which can be used to restrict the number of solutions to
navigational queries. In particular, our formalism allows us to define
quantitative properties such as length or accumulated cost, which can be used
as query filters. Furthermore, it enables the identification and removal of
paths that may be considered ill-formed.
  The new formalism is defined in terms of an operational semantics for the
query language that incorporates these new constructs, demonstrating its
soundness and completeness by proving its compatibility with a simple logical
semantics. We also analyze its expressive power, showing that path properties
are more expressive than register automata. Finally, after discussing some
complexity issues related to this new approach, we present an empirical
analysis carried out using our prototype implementation of the graph database
that serves as a running example throughout the paper. The results show that
queries using path properties as filters outperform standard queries that do
not use them.

### [5] [CUTHERMO: Understanding GPU Memory Inefficiencies with Heat Map Profiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18729)
*Yanbo Zhao,Jinku Cui,Zecheng Li,Shuyin Jiao,Xu Liu,Jiajia Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: cuThermo是一个轻量级GPU内存分析工具，通过热图识别内存访问模式，优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU内存子系统的高效利用对性能至关重要，但缺乏全面的运行时和细粒度内存分析工具。

Method: cuThermo通过分析GPU二进制文件，生成基于访问模式的热图，无需修改硬件或源代码。

Result: 实验表明，cuThermo识别出五种可移植的内存访问模式，并在两种GPU上实现了最高721.79%的性能提升。

Conclusion: cuThermo为GPU内存分析提供了实用且高效的解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: GPUs have become indispensable in high-performance computing, machine
learning, and many other domains. Efficiently utilizing the memory subsystem on
GPUs is critical for maximizing computing power through massive parallelism.
Analyzing memory access patterns has proven to be an effective method for
understanding memory bottlenecks in applications. However, comprehensive
runtime and fine-grained memory profiling support is lacking on GPU
architectures. In this work, we introduce cuThermo, a lightweight and practical
profiling tool for GPU memory analysis. It operates on GPU binaries without
requiring any modifications to hardware, operating system, or application
source code. Given a CUDA application, cuThermo identifies memory
inefficiencies at runtime via a heat map based on distinct visited warp counts
to represent word-sector-level data sharing and provides optimization guidance
in performance tuning iterations. Through our experiments on six applications,
we identified five memory access patterns that are portable across different
GPU architectures. By evaluating optimization on two GPUs, cuThermo achieves up
to $721.79\%$ performance improvement.

### [6] [PPipe: Efficient Video Analytics Serving on Heterogeneous GPU Clusters via Pool-Based Pipeline Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18748)
*Z. Jonny Kong,Qiang Xu,Y. Charlie Hu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用流水线并行技术（PPipe）在异构GPU集群上高效服务延迟敏感型模型推理的方法，显著提升了低端GPU的利用率和服务吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GPU的快速创新，异构GPU集群在云计算和本地数据中心中日益普遍。然而，低端GPU在延迟敏感型推理任务中的潜力被忽视，本文旨在探索如何利用流水线并行技术充分发挥其能力。

Method: 提出PPipe系统，通过基于MILP的控制平面和基于资源预留的自适应批处理数据平面，实现池化流水线并行，充分利用模型层和GPU架构的多样性。

Result: 在18种CNN模型上的评估显示，PPipe将低端GPU利用率提升41.1%-65.5%，同时保持高端GPU的高利用率，服务吞吐量比基线高32.2%-75.1%。

Conclusion: PPipe证明了流水线并行技术在异构GPU集群中用于模型推理服务的有效性，显著提升了资源利用率和吞吐量。

Abstract: With the rapid innovation of GPUs, heterogeneous GPU clusters in both public
clouds and on-premise data centers have become increasingly commonplace. In
this paper, we demonstrate how pipeline parallelism, a technique wellstudied
for throughput-oriented deep learning model training, can be used effectively
for serving latency-bound model inference, e.g., in video analytics systems, on
heterogeneous GPU clusters. Our work exploits the synergy between diversity in
model layers and diversity in GPU architectures, which results in comparable
inference latency for many layers when running on low-class and high-class
GPUs. We explore how such overlooked capability of low-class GPUs can be
exploited using pipeline parallelism and present a novel inference serving
system, PPipe, that employs pool-based pipeline parallelism via an MILP-based
control plane and a data plane that performs resource reservation-based
adaptive batching. Evaluation results on diverse workloads (18 CNN models) show
that PPipe achieves 41.1% - 65.5% higher utilization of low-class GPUs while
maintaining high utilization of high-class GPUs, leading to 32.2% - 75.1%
higher serving throughput compared to various baselines.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化的任务调度算法，旨在满足移动边缘计算和云系统中的严格交互服务质量要求，通过低复杂度的算法实现高效调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动边缘计算和云系统对交互服务质量要求的提高，需要优化任务调度以满足低延迟和截止时间要求。

Method: 设计了最优任务调度算法，确定任务的最优顺序，并提供在线方法处理随机到达的任务。

Result: 算法具有线性和线性对数时间复杂度，性能分析显示其最优性和高效性。

Conclusion: 数值结果表明，该算法在服务率和调度成本方面表现优异。

Abstract: The demand for stringent interactive quality-of-service has intensified in
both mobile edge computing (MEC) and cloud systems, driven by the imperative to
improve user experiences. As a result, the processing of computation-intensive
tasks in these systems necessitates adherence to specific deadlines or
achieving extremely low latency. To optimize task scheduling performance,
existing research has mainly focused on reducing the number of late jobs whose
deadlines are not met. However, the primary challenge with these methods lies
in the total search time and scheduling efficiency. In this paper, we present
the optimal job scheduling algorithm designed to determine the optimal task
order for a given set of tasks. In addition, users are enabled to make informed
decisions for offloading tasks based on the information provided by servers.
The details of performance analysis are provided to show its optimality and low
complexity with the linearithmic time O(nlogn), where $n$ is the number of
tasks. To tackle the uncertainty of the randomly arriving tasks, we further
develop an online approach with fast outage detection that achieves rapid
acceptance times with time complexity of O(n). Extensive numerical results are
provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of
the service ratio and scheduling cost.

### [8] [GPUnion: Autonomous GPU Sharing on Campus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18928)
*Yufang Li,Yuanbo Zhang,Hanlong Liao,Guoming Tang,Deke Guo*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: GPUnion是一个校园级GPU共享平台，通过自愿参与和保持提供者自主性，提高GPU利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 校园中GPU资源分配不均，部分实验室资源闲置而其他实验室缺乏AI研究所需的计算能力。

Method: GPUnion采用容器化任务调度、资源提供者优先架构和弹性执行机制（如自动检查点和迁移），并支持自定义数据存储和非根执行以提升安全性。

Result: 案例研究表明，GPU利用率提高30%，交互会话增加40%，提供者退出时工作负载迁移成功率达94%。

Conclusion: GPUnion证明提供者自主性与平台可靠性可共存，挑战传统集中式模式，促进校园内计算资源的民主化访问。

Abstract: A pronounced imbalance in GPU resources exists on campus, where some
laboratories own underutilized servers while others lack the compute needed for
AI research. GPU sharing can alleviate this disparity, while existing platforms
typically rely on centralized oversight and persistent allocation models,
conflicting with the voluntary and autonomous nature of academic resource
ownership. We present GPUnion, a campus-scale GPU sharing platform enabling
voluntary participation while preserving full provider autonomy. GPUnion
incorporates three core mechanisms: i) container-based task dispatching and
execution, ii) resource provider-first architecture, and iii) resilient
execution featuring automatic checkpointing and migration. GPUnion also
supports custom data storage and integrates the non-root execution and image
attestation for isolation and security improvement for containerization. Case
studies across multiple campus scenarios demonstrate 30% more GPU utilization
improvement, 40% increase in interactive sessions, and 94% successful workload
migration during provider departures. GPUnion demonstrates that provider
autonomy and platform reliability can coexist, challenging conventional
centralized paradigms and democratizing access to computational resources
within campus networks.

### [9] [The Case for Time-Shared Computing Resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19287)
*Pierre Jacquet,Adrien Luxey-Bitri*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文探讨了ICT行业的环境影响，提出通过改进租户间资源共享来减少物理资源使用，从而提升能源效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICT行业的环境影响日益显著，资源有限性要求更严格的管理。当前租户间资源共享不足，导致资源浪费。

Method: 提出超越传统硬件级时间共享的高层次资源共享方法，强调在性能降低条件下减少资源使用。

Result: 通过基础设施共享，可以减少集群规模并提高能源效率，性能与资源使用的权衡可能更易被社会接受。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁研究更高层次的资源共享方法，以减少ICT行业的环境影响，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The environmental impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)
continues to grow, driven notably by increasing usage, rebound effects, and
emerging demands. However, despite the virtual nature of its services, the
sector remains inherently constrained by its materiality and cannot rely on an
infinite pool of resources. As a result, the wide variety of supported services
may need to be managed under stricter limits within hosting facilities in the
future. Contrary to common assumptions, we show that tenants typically do not
share computing resources, even in environments commonly perceived as
mutualized, such as cloud platforms. Time-sharing has been progressively phased
out for reasons of performance, security, predictability, and, perhaps more
importantly, due to the decreasing cost of computing resources. This paper
advocates for managing fewer physical resources by improving resource sharing
between tenants. It represents a paradigm shift, moving beyond traditional
time-sharing at the hardware level to a higher abstraction. This approach
entails "doing with fewer resources" under conditions of "reduced performance".
Nonetheless, enhancing the mutualization of infrastructure can reduce cluster
sizes (through consolidation) and improve energy efficiency, with gains related
to the accepted performance trade-off, a situation potentially more socially
acceptable than eliminating services. We review the current state of the art,
identify challenges and opportunities, propose interpretations of Time-Shared
Computing, and outline key research directions.

### [10] [A Truly Subcubic Combinatorial Algorithm for Induced 4-Cycle Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18845)
*Amir Abboud,Shyan Akmal,Nick Fischer*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种首个真正次立方的组合算法，用于检测图中的诱导4-周期，运行时间为O(n^2.84)，解决了诱导4-周期检测是否与三角形检测复杂度相同的开放问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决诱导子图检测的复杂性分类问题，特别是诱导4-周期检测是否与三角形检测（在BMM假设下需要n^{3-o(1)}时间）具有相同的复杂度。

Method: 方法采用图分解技术，不同于传统的子图检测算法，将全局问题中的分解技术应用于局部问题。

Result: 结果展示了一种运行时间为O(n^2.84)的组合算法，首次在确定性算法中实现了非平凡的性能。

Conclusion: 结论表明诱导4-周期检测的复杂度低于三角形检测，为相关分类问题提供了负面的解答。

Abstract: We present the first truly subcubic, combinatorial algorithm for detecting an
induced $4$-cycle in a graph. The running time is $O(n^{2.84})$ on $n$-node
graphs, thus separating the task of detecting induced $4$-cycles from detecting
triangles, which requires $n^{3-o(1)}$ time combinatorially under the popular
BMM hypothesis.
  Significant work has gone into characterizing the exact time complexity of
induced $H$-detection, relative to the complexity of detecting cliques of
various sizes. Prior work identified the question of whether induced $4$-cycle
detection is triangle-hard as the only remaining case towards completing the
lowest level of the classification, dubbing it a "curious" case [Dalirrooyfard,
Vassilevska W., FOCS 2022]. Our result can be seen as a negative resolution of
this question.
  Our algorithm deviates from previous techniques in the large body of subgraph
detection algorithms and employs the trendy topic of graph decomposition that
has hitherto been restricted to more global problems (as in the use of expander
decompositions for flow problems) or to shaving subpolynomial factors (as in
the application of graph regularity lemmas). While our algorithm is slower than
the (non-combinatorial) state-of-the-art $\tilde{O}(n^{\omega})$-time algorithm
based on polynomial identity testing [Vassilevska W., Wang, Williams, Yu, SODA
2014], combinatorial advancements often come with other benefits. In
particular, we give the first nontrivial deterministic algorithm for detecting
induced $4$-cycles.

Motivation: 研究字符串共识问题的扩展版本，允许更多操作（如交换）以更灵活地解决实际问题。

Result: 证明了扩展问题是FPT的，并提出了一个多项式时间算法用于特定变体。

Conclusion: 扩展问题在参数d下可高效解决，且特定变体有快速算法支持。

Abstract: String consensus problems aim at finding a string that minimizes some given
distance with respect to an input set of strings. In particular, in the
\textsc{Closest String} problem, we are given a set of strings of equal length
and a radius $d$. The objective is to find a new string that differs from each
input string by at most $d$ substitutions. We study a generalization of this
problem where, in addition to substitutions, swaps of adjacent characters are
also permitted, each operation incurring a unit cost. Amir et al. showed that
this generalized problem is NP-hard, even when only swaps are allowed. In this
paper, we show that it is FPT with respect to the parameter $d$. Moreover, we
investigate a variant in which the goal is to minimize the sum of distances
from the output string to all input strings. For this version, we present a
polynomial-time algorithm.

Motivation: 研究如何在移除图的边时，以最小成本或最大利润增加最小生成树的权重，填补现有近似算法在此类问题中的空白。

Result: 证明了预算最小化和利润最大化问题的多项式时间对数近似保证，并提供了高效算法解决最小化成本的版本。

Conclusion: 论文通过图论松弛和超模性质，为最小生成树阻断问题提供了新的近似算法和理论保证。

Abstract: We give polynomial time logarithmic approximation guarantees for the budget
minimization, as well as for the profit maximization versions of minimum
spanning tree interdiction. In this problem, the goal is to remove some edges
of an undirected graph with edge weights and edge costs, so as to increase the
weight of a minimum spanning tree. In the budget minimization version, the goal
is to minimize the total cost of the removed edges, while achieving a desired
increase $\Delta$ in the weight of the minimum spanning tree. An alternative
objective within the same framework is to maximize the profit of interdiction,
namely the increase in the weight of the minimum spanning tree, subject to a
budget constraint. There are known polynomial time $O(1)$ approximation
guarantees for a similar objective (maximizing the total cost of the tree,
rather than the increase). However, the guarantee does not seem to apply to the
increase in cost. Moreover, the same techniques do not seem to apply to the
budget version.
  Our approximation guarantees are motivated by studying the question of
minimizing the cost of increasing the minimum spanning tree by any amount. We
show that in contrast to the budget and profit problems, this version of
interdiction is polynomial time-solvable, and we give an efficient algorithm
for solving it. The solution motivates a graph-theoretic relaxation of the
NP-hard interdiction problem. The gain in minimum spanning tree weight, as a
function of the set of removed edges, is super-modular. Thus, the budget
problem is an instance of minimizing a linear function subject to a
super-modular covering constraint. We use the graph-theoretic relaxation to
design and analyze a batch greedy-based algorithm.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a structured approximation (low-rank,
sparse, banded, etc.) to an unknown matrix $A$ given access to matrix-vector
product (matvec) queries of the form $x \rightarrow Ax$ and $x \rightarrow
A^Tx$. This problem is of central importance to algorithms across scientific
computing and machine learning, with applications to fast multiplication and
inversion for structured matrices, building preconditioners for first-order
optimization, and as a model for differential operator learning. Prior work
focuses on obtaining query complexity upper and lower bounds for learning
specific structured matrix families that commonly arise in applications.
  We initiate the study of the problem in greater generality, aiming to
understand the query complexity of learning approximations from general matrix
families. Our main result focuses on finding a near-optimal approximation to
$A$ from any finite-sized family of matrices, $\mathcal{F}$. Standard results
from matrix sketching show that $O(\log|\mathcal{F}|)$ matvec queries suffice
in this setting. This bound can also be achieved, and is optimal, for
vector-matrix-vector queries of the form $x,y\rightarrow x^TAy$, which have
been widely studied in work on rank-$1$ matrix sensing.
  Surprisingly, we show that, in the matvec model, it is possible to obtain a
nearly quadratic improvement in complexity, to
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log|\mathcal{F}|})$. Further, we prove that this bound is
tight up to log-log factors.Via covering number arguments, our result extends
to well-studied infinite families. As an example, we establish that a
near-optimal approximation from any \emph{linear matrix family} of dimension
$q$ can be learned with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{q})$ matvec queries, improving on an
$O(q)$ bound achievable via sketching techniques and vector-matrix-vector
queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Oblivious Bipartite Matching问题中的分布无关算法竞争比限制，突破1-1/e的界限。

Method: 提出Quadratic Ranking算法，通过参数化两个函数，并利用二次形式优化函数选择。

Result: 实现了0.659的竞争比，优于现有的0.641分布依赖算法。

Conclusion: Quadratic Ranking算法通过二次形式优化，显著提升了竞争比，解决了开放性问题。

Abstract: We present a $0.659$-competitive Quadratic Ranking algorithm for the
Oblivious Bipartite Matching problem, a distribution-free version of
Query-Commit Matching. This result breaks the $1-\frac{1}{e}$ barrier,
addressing an open question raised by Tang, Wu, and Zhang (JACM 2023).
Moreover, the competitive ratio of this distribution-free algorithm improves
the best existing $0.641$ ratio for Query-Commit Matching achieved by the
distribution-dependent algorithm of Chen, Huang, Li, and Tang (SODA 2025).
  Quadratic Ranking is a novel variant of the classic Ranking algorithm. We
parameterize the algorithm with two functions, and let two key expressions in
the definition and analysis of the algorithm be quadratic forms of the two
functions. We show that the quadratic forms are the unique choices that satisfy
a set of natural properties. Further, they allow us to optimize the choice of
the two functions using powerful quadratic programming solvers.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于LLM的工程代理，用于大规模修复代码中的测试失败问题，结合ReAct框架和静态分析工具，取得了42.3%的解决率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的发展，大型组织可以利用其能力进行大规模代码修复，提高效率。

Method: 以Llama为基础，使用ReAct框架开发代理，通过静态分析和测试失败反馈优化解决方案，并利用LLM-as-a-Judge确保补丁质量。

Result: 离线评估中，70B模型与405B模型表现相当；生产环境中，31.5%的生成补丁被采纳。

Conclusion: 工程代理在代码修复中表现出潜力，但仍需进一步优化以提高解决率和采纳率。

Abstract: Aim: With the advent of LLMs, sophisticated agentic program repair has become
viable at large organizations with large codebases. In this work, we develop an
Engineering Agent that fixes the source code based on test failures at scale
across diverse software offerings internally.
  Method: Using Llama as the base, we employ the ReAct harness to develop an
agent. We start with a test failure that was triaged by a rule-based test
failure bot. We then set up an agentic harness and allow the agent to reason
and run a set of 15 actions from reading a file to generating a patch. We
provide feedback to the agent through static analysis and test failures so it
can refine its solution. We leverage an LLM-as-a-Judge to ensure that the patch
conforms to the standards followed by a human review to land fixes.
  Benchmark Findings: We curated offline benchmarks for our patch generator,
the Engineering Agent loop, and the LLM-as-a-Judge. In offline evaluations we
found that a specialized 70B model is highly competitive with the much larger
but vanilla Llama-405B. In an ablation study, we found that the ReAct harness
(neural model) benefited from the symbolic information from static analysis
tools and test execution traces. A model that strikes a balance between the
solve rate and error rate vs the cost and latency has a benchmark solve rate of
42.3% using an average 11.8 feedback iterations.
  Production Findings: In a three month period, 80% of the generated fixes were
reviewed, of which 31.5% were landed (25.5% of the total number of generated
fixes).
  Feedback from Engineers: We used open coding to extract qualitative themes
from engineers' feedback. We saw positive feedback in the form of quick
approvals, gratitude, and surprise. We also found mixed feedback when the
Engineering Agent's solution was partially correct and it served as a good
starting point.

TL;DR: MemoCoder是一个多代理框架，通过协作解决问题和从过去的修复中学习，提升代码生成的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在迭代调试和错误处理方面表现不佳，且缺乏知识积累和重用机制。

Method: 提出MemoCoder框架，包括一个修复知识集和一个导师代理，用于存储和重用修复经验，并指导自修复循环。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MemoCoder在Pass@10和Pass@50指标上显著优于零样本提示和自修复策略。

Conclusion: MemoCoder通过知识积累和协作修复，有效提升了代码生成的迭代优化能力。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GitHub
Copilot and ChatGPT, developers increasingly rely on AI-assisted tools to
support code generation. While LLMs can generate syntactically correct
solutions for well-structured programming tasks, they often struggle with
challenges that require iterative debugging, error handling, or adaptation to
diverse problem structures. Existing approaches such as fine-tuning or
self-repair strategies either require costly retraining or lack mechanisms to
accumulate and reuse knowledge from previous attempts.
  To address these limitations, we propose MemoCoder, a multi-agent framework
that enables collaborative problem solving and persistent learning from past
fixes. At the core of MemoCoder is a Fixing Knowledge Set, which stores
successful repairs and supports retrieval for future tasks. A central Mentor
Agent supervises the repair process by identifying recurring error patterns and
refining high-level fixing strategies, providing a novel supervisory role that
guides the self-repair loop. We evaluate MemoCoder across three public
benchmarks -- MBPP, HumanEval, and LiveCodeBench -- spanning a range of problem
complexities. Experimental results show that MemoCoder consistently outperforms
both zero-shot prompting and a Self-Repair strategy, with improvements ranging
from 3.1% to 12.1% in Pass@10 and from 1.4% to 14.5% in Pass@50, demonstrating
its effectiveness in iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Notebook的特性使其难以分析，现有软件工程工具无法捕捉其独特性，因此需要研究其错误和漏洞。

Method: 收集并分析两大平台的Notebook数据，通过定量分析和定性研究（扎根理论）分类错误，并评估部署框架的风险。

Result: 配置问题和API使用错误是最常见的错误，同时部署框架存在安全风险。

Conclusion: Notebook的支持不如传统软件，导致代码复杂、配置错误和维护不足。

Abstract: Background. Jupyter notebooks are one of the main tools used by data
scientists. Notebooks include features (configuration scripts, markdown,
images, etc.) that make them challenging to analyze compared to traditional
software. As a result, existing software engineering models, tools, and studies
do not capture the uniqueness of Notebook's behavior. Aims. This paper aims to
provide a large-scale empirical study of bugs and vulnerabilities in the
Notebook ecosystem. Method. We collected and analyzed a large dataset of
Notebooks from two major platforms. Our methodology involved quantitative
analyses of notebook characteristics (such as complexity metrics, contributor
activity, and documentation) to identify factors correlated with bugs.
Additionally, we conducted a qualitative study using grounded theory to
categorize notebook bugs, resulting in a comprehensive bug taxonomy. Finally,
we analyzed security-related commits and vulnerability reports to assess risks
associated with Notebook deployment frameworks. Results. Our findings highlight
that configuration issues are among the most common bugs in notebook documents,
followed by incorrect API usage. Finally, we explore common vulnerabilities
associated with popular deployment frameworks to better understand risks
associated with Notebook development. Conclusions. This work highlights that
notebooks are less well-supported than traditional software, resulting in more
complex code, misconfiguration, and poor maintenance.

TL;DR: SliceMate是一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的静态程序切片方法，通过三个专门代理（合成、验证和优化）实现高效切片，显著优于传统和学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统切片工具依赖计算密集的依赖图分析，难以扩展到大型程序或不完整代码；现有学习方法在完整代码上性能不足。

Method: SliceMate利用LLM代理（合成、验证和优化）绕过显式依赖图构建，通过增量扫描和验证生成高质量切片。

Result: 在包含2,200个Java和Python程序的SliceBench基准测试中，SliceMate显著优于传统和学习方法。

Conclusion: SliceMate展示了LLM在程序切片中的潜力，提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Static program slicing, which extracts the executable portions of a program
that affect the values at a specific location, supports many software analysis
tasks such as debugging and security auditing. However, traditional slicing
tools rely on computationally expensive reachability analysis over dependency
graphs, which struggle to scale to large programs and often fail to handle code
with incomplete syntax. Recently emerged learning-based methods, while more
robust to such cases, still fall short of achieving comparable performance to
traditional methods on well-formed code.
  In this work, we propose SliceMate, a novel static program slicing solution
powered by Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It bypasses the need for explicit
dependency graph construction and achieving superior slicing accuracy.
Concretely, SliceMate integrates three specialized agents: (1) a synthesis
agent that produces candidate slices by incrementally expanding the scan scope
across functions and files guided by LLM-inferred dependencies; (2) a
verification agent that performs conciseness and completeness checks of the
candidate slices, detecting missing or irrelevant statements; and (3) a
refinement agent that repairs the slices with minimal edits in accordance with
the verification results. These agents are orchestrated by a control module
that ensures timely convergence and outputs high-quality slices without manual
intervention. For rigorous evaluation, we construct a new and high-quality
benchmark, SliceBench, comprising 2,200 manually annotated Java and Python
programs, with program lengths ranging from 5 to 8,577 lines, significantly
larger than those in existing slicing benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SliceMate greatly outperforms both traditional and learning-based slicing
tools.

Conclusion: 通过自动分类GitHub问题，可以显著提升开发效率，DNN模型是有效的解决方案。

Abstract: GitHub is the most widely used platform for software maintenance in the
open-source community. Developers report issues on GitHub from time to time
while facing difficulties. Having labels on those issues can help developers
easily address those issues with prior knowledge of labels. However, most of
the GitHub repositories do not maintain regular labeling for the issues. The
goal of this work is to classify issues in the open-source community using ML
\& DNN models. There are thousands of open-source repositories on GitHub. Some
of the repositories label their issues properly whereas some of them do not.
When issues are pre-labeled, the problem-solving process and the immediate
assignment of corresponding personnel are facilitated for the team, thereby
expediting the development process. In this work, we conducted an analysis of
prominent GitHub open-source repositories. We classified the issues in some
common labels which are: API, Documentation, Enhancement, Question, Easy,
Help-wanted, Dependency, CI, Waiting for OP's response, Test, Bug, etc. Our
study shows that DNN models outperf

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文创建了一个基准数据集（SESR-Eval）来评估大语言模型（LLMs）在系统综述标题-摘要筛选中的表现，发现LLMs在软件工程领域的应用尚不成熟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在系统综述标题-摘要筛选中的性能，并为其在软件工程领域的应用提供依据。

Method: 从169个系统综述中筛选出24个适合的数据集，使用9种LLMs进行基准测试。

Result: SESR-Eval数据集包含34,528个标记的研究，LLMs表现相似，但筛选准确性在不同研究中差异较大，成本较低（<40美元/研究）。

Conclusion: 目前LLMs在标题-摘要筛选中表现不稳定，不推荐自动化使用，未来将研究影响性能的因素。

Abstract: Background: The use of large language models (LLMs) in the title-abstract
screening process of systematic reviews (SRs) has shown promising results, but
suffers from limited performance evaluation. Aims: Create a benchmark dataset
to evaluate the performance of LLMs in the title-abstract screening process of
SRs. Provide evidence whether using LLMs in title-abstract screening in
software engineering is advisable. Method: We start with 169 SR research
artifacts and find 24 of those to be suitable for inclusion in the dataset.
Using the dataset we benchmark title-abstract screening using 9 LLMs. Results:
We present the SESR-Eval (Software Engineering Systematic Review Evaluation)
dataset containing 34,528 labeled primary studies, sourced from 24 secondary
studies published in software engineering (SE) journals. Most LLMs performed
similarly and the differences in screening accuracy between secondary studies
are greater than differences between LLMs. The cost of using an LLM is
relatively low - less than $40 per secondary study even for the most expensive
model. Conclusions: Our benchmark enables monitoring AI performance in the
screening task of SRs in software engineering. At present, LLMs are not yet
recommended for automating the title-abstract screening process, since accuracy
varies widely across secondary studies, and no LLM managed a high recall with
reasonable precision. In future, we plan to investigate factors that influence
LLM screening performance between studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需求规范的生成过程繁琐且耗时，知识分散于多种来源，希望通过LLMs自动化这一过程。

Method: 使用LLMs基于需求收集文档和FDS模板生成Epic FDS和用户故事，并与人工生成结果对比。

Result: LLMs能自动化并标准化需求规范，但生成质量依赖输入且需人工修订。

Conclusion: 建议采用LLMs作为起草工具，结合人工分析实现高质量需求工程文档。

Abstract: In practice, requirements specification remains a critical challenge. The
knowledge necessary to generate a specification can often be fragmented across
diverse sources (e.g., meeting minutes, emails, and high-level product
descriptions), making the process cumbersome and time-consuming. In this paper,
we report our experience using large language models (LLMs) in an IT consulting
company to automate the requirements specification process. In this company,
requirements are specified using a Functional Design Specification (FDS), a
document that outlines the functional requirements and features of a system,
application, or process. We provide LLMs with a summary of the requirements
elicitation documents and FDS templates, prompting them to generate Epic FDS
(including high-level product descriptions) and user stories, which are
subsequently compiled into a complete FDS document. We compared the correctness
and quality of the FDS generated by three state-of-the-art LLMs against those
produced by human analysts. Our results show that LLMs can help automate and
standardize the requirements specification, reducing time and human effort.
However, the quality of LLM-generated FDS highly depends on inputs and often
requires human revision. Thus, we advocate for a synergistic approach in which
an LLM serves as an effective drafting tool while human analysts provide the
critical contextual and technical oversight necessary for high-quality
requirements engineering (RE) documentation.

Abstract: Code review is one of the primary means of assuring the quality of released
software along with testing and static analysis. However, code review requires
experienced developers who may not always have the time to perform an in-depth
review of code. Thus, automating code review can help alleviate the cognitive
burden on experienced software developers allowing them to focus on their
primary activities of writing code to add new features and fix bugs. In this
paper, we describe our experience in using Large Language Models towards
automating the code review process in Ericsson. We describe the development of
a lightweight tool using LLMs and static program analysis. We then describe our
preliminary experiments with experienced developers in evaluating our code
review tool and the encouraging results.

Motivation: 代码审查对软件质量至关重要，但耗时且认知负担重，语言模型为自动化审查任务提供了新途径。

Method: 对CodeReviewer、CodeLlama-7B和DeepSeek-R1-Distill三种模型在C#数据集上进行单语言微调，评估其在代码变更质量估计、审查评论生成和代码优化任务中的表现。

Result: 单语言微调显著提升了模型的准确性和相关性，但在语义复杂或上下文敏感的变更中，人类审查员仍表现更优。

Conclusion: 语言对齐和任务特定适配对优化语言模型在自动化代码审查中的表现至关重要。

Abstract: Code review is essential for maintaining software quality but often
time-consuming and cognitively demanding, especially in industrial
environments. Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have opened new
avenues for automating core review tasks. This study presents the empirical
evaluation of monolingual fine-tuning on the performance of open-source LMs
across three key automated code review tasks: Code Change Quality Estimation,
Review Comment Generation, and Code Refinement. We fine-tuned three distinct
models, CodeReviewer, CodeLlama-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill, on a C\# specific
dataset combining public benchmarks with industrial repositories. Our study
investigates how different configurations of programming languages and natural
languages in the training data affect LM performance, particularly in comment
generation. Additionally, we benchmark the fine-tuned models against an
automated software analysis tool (ASAT) and human reviewers to evaluate their
practical utility in real-world settings. Our results show that monolingual
fine-tuning improves model accuracy and relevance compared to multilingual
baselines. While LMs can effectively support code review workflows, especially
for routine or repetitive tasks, human reviewers remain superior in handling
semantically complex or context-sensitive changes. Our findings highlight the
importance of language alignment and task-specific adaptation in optimizing LMs
for automated code review.

Motivation: 现代语言（如Rust、C++）的复杂结构（如模板、宏）使得设计高质量的变异器具有挑战性，现有方法依赖人工设计或修正，难以扩展和跨语言通用。

Method: Mut4All通过三个代理实现：变异器发明代理（识别目标并生成元数据）、变异器实现合成代理（生成初始实现）、变异器优化代理（通过单元测试反馈验证和修正）。

Result: 处理1000个错误报告，生成319个Rust和403个C++变异器，成本约0.08美元/个。定制模糊测试器发现62个Rust编译器错误（38个新错误）和34个C++编译器错误（16个新错误），性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Mut4All在自动化和跨语言通用性方面表现出色，显著提升了编译器漏洞检测的效率和效果。

Abstract: Mutation-based fuzzing is effective for uncovering compiler bugs, but
designing high-quality mutators for modern languages with complex constructs
(e.g., templates, macros) remains challenging. Existing methods rely heavily on
manual design or human-in-the-loop correction, limiting scalability and
cross-language generalizability.
  We present Mut4All, a fully automated, language-agnostic framework that
synthesizes mutators using Large Language Models (LLMs) and compiler-specific
knowledge from bug reports. It consists of three agents: (1) a mutator
invention agent that identifies mutation targets and generates mutator metadata
using compiler-related insights; (2) a mutator implementation synthesis agent,
fine-tuned to produce initial implementations; and (3) a mutator refinement
agent that verifies and corrects the mutators via unit-test feedback.
  Mut4All processes 1000 bug reports (500 Rust, 500 C++), yielding 319 Rust and
403 C++ mutators at ~$0.08 each via GPT-4o. Our customized fuzzer, using these
mutators, finds 62 bugs in Rust compilers (38 new, 7 fixed) and 34 bugs in C++
compilers (16 new, 1 fixed). Mut4All outperforms existing methods in both
unique crash detection and coverage, ranking first on Rust and second on C++.

Motivation: 联网车辆的高可靠性和可用性要求需要快速解决故障，但复杂的云/边缘架构依赖关系使手动分析不可行。

Method: SDVDiag平台支持从数据收集到根因追踪的自动化管道，动态更新依赖图并监控异常。

Result: 在5G测试环境中，SDVDiag能可靠检测注入的故障，减少停机时间。

Conclusion: SDVDiag通过自动化诊断和动态分析，为联网车辆提供早期故障识别和解决能力。

Abstract: Connected and software-defined vehicles promise to offer a broad range of
services and advanced functions to customers, aiming to increase passenger
comfort and support autonomous driving capabilities. Due to the high
reliability and availability requirements of connected vehicles, it is crucial
to resolve any occurring failures quickly. To achieve this however, a complex
cloud/edge architecture with a mesh of dependencies must be navigated to
diagnose the responsible root cause. As such, manual analyses become unfeasible
since they would significantly delay the troubleshooting.
  To address this challenge, this paper presents SDVDiag, an extensible
platform for the automated diagnosis of connected vehicle functions. The
platform enables the creation of pipelines that cover all steps from initial
data collection to the tracing of potential root causes. In addition, SDVDiag
supports self-adaptive behavior by the ability to exchange modules at runtime.
Dependencies between functions are detected and continuously updated, resulting
in a dynamic graph view of the system. In addition, vital system metrics are
monitored for anomalies. Whenever an incident is investigated, a snapshot of
the graph is taken and augmented by relevant anomalies. Finally, the analysis
is performed by traversing the graph and creating a ranking of the most likely
causes.
  To evaluate the platform, it is deployed inside an 5G test fleet environment
for connected vehicle functions. The results show that injected faults can be
detected reliably. As such, the platform offers the potential to gain new
insights and reduce downtime by identifying problems and their causes at an
early stage.

TL;DR: ReCatcher是一个用于Python代码生成的回归测试框架，通过比较逻辑正确性、代码质量和执行性能来评估LLM更新中的回归问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的快速更新，可能引入逻辑正确性、代码质量和性能的回归问题，需要系统化的评估工具。

Method: ReCatcher通过比较当前模型和候选更新在三个维度（逻辑正确性、静态代码质量和执行性能）来评估回归问题。

Result: 评估显示，不同更新场景（如微调、合并和新模型发布）会引入不同程度的回归问题，ReCatcher在这些方面表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ReCatcher强调了在采用新模型前进行系统化回归评估的重要性，帮助研究者和从业者做出更明智的更新决策。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation evolve rapidly through
fine-tuning, merging, or new model releases. However, such updates can
introduce regressions, not only in correctness but also in code quality and
performance. To address this, we present ReCatcher, a regression testing
framework for Python code generation. ReCatcher systematically compares two
LLMs, typically a current model and a candidate update, across three
dimensions: logical correctness, static code quality, and execution
performance. We apply ReCatcher to assess regressions across three update
scenarios, fine-tuning, merging, and model release, using CodeLlama,
DeepSeek-Coder, and GPT-4o. Our evaluation shows that fine-tuning with
cross-language datasets increases syntax errors by up to 12%. Merging with
general-purpose models like Llama2 leads to regressions in correctness by up to
18%. GPT-4o introduces regressions of up to 50% in handling missing imports
compared to GPT-3.5-turbo, while GPT-4o-mini suffers up to 80% performance
degradation in execution time versus GPT-4o. Overall, logical correctness,
performance, and error handling (e.g., syntax errors and missing imports) are
the most regression-prone areas. Comparing ReCatcher with baseline solutions,
it presents better and consistent accuracy across logical and performance
aspects. ReCatcher highlights the importance of systematic regression
evaluation before adopting new models, while assisting researchers and
practitioners in making more informed update decisions.

Conclusion: 该流水线为SDV的软件变体和OTA更新管理提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，推动了未来移动技术的发展。

Abstract: Software-defined vehicles (SDVs) offer a wide range of connected
functionalities, including enhanced driving behavior and fleet management.
These features are continuously updated via over-the-air (OTA) mechanisms,
resulting in a growing number of software versions and variants due to the
diversity of vehicles, cloud/edge environments, and stakeholders involved. The
lack of a unified integration environment further complicates development, as
connected mobility solutions are often built in isolation. To ensure reliable
operations across heterogeneous systems, a dynamic orchestration of functions
that considers hardware and software variability is essential. This paper
presents an open-source CI/CD pipeline tailored for SDVs. It automates the
build, test, and deployment phases using a combination of containerized
open-source tools, creating a standardized, portable, and scalable ecosystem
accessible to all stakeholders. Additionally, a custom OTA middleware
distributes software updates and supports rollbacks across vehicles and backend
services. Update variants are derived based on deployment target dependencies
and hardware configurations. The pipeline also supports continuous development
and deployment of AI models for autonomous driving features. Its effectiveness
is evaluated using an automated valet parking (AVP) scenario involving
TurtleBots and a coordinating backend server. Two object detection variants are
developed and deployed to match hardware-specific requirements. Results
demonstrate seamless OTA updates, correct variant selection, and successful
orchestration across all targets. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides a
scalable and efficient solution for managing software variants and OTA updates
in SDVs, contributing to the advancement of future mobility technologies.

Result: 在88个真实构建冲突中，BUCOR为65个案例生成至少一个解决方案，并正确解决了43个冲突。

Conclusion: 结合上下文感知的示例学习和结构化规则解决策略的混合方法能有效解决冲突，为未来更智能的合并工具提供方向。

Abstract: Merge conflicts often arise when developers integrate changes from different
software branches. The conflicts can result from overlapping edits in programs
(i.e., textual conflicts) or cause build and test errors (i.e., build and test
conflicts). They degrade software quality and hinder programmer productivity.
While several tools detect build conflicts, few offer meaningful support for
resolving cases like those caused by method removal. To overcome limitations of
existing tools, we introduce BUCOR (Build Conflict Resolver), a new conflict
resolver. BUCOR first detects conflicts by comparing three versions related to
a merging scenario: base b, left l, and right r. To resolve conflicts, it
employs two complementary strategies: example-based transformation (BUCOR-E)
and rule-based transformation (BUCOR-R). BUCOR-R applies predefined rules to
handle common, well-understood conflicts. BUCOR-E mines branch versions (l and
r) for exemplar edits applied to fix related build errors. From these examples,
it infers and generalizes program transformation patterns to resolve more
complex conflicts.
  We evaluated BUCOR on 88 real-world build conflicts spanning 21 distinct
conflict types. BUCOR generated at least one solution for 65 cases and
correctly resolved 43 conflicts. We observed that this hybrid
approach--combining context-aware, example-based learning with structured,
rule-based resolution--can effectively help resolve conflicts. Our research
sheds light on future directions for more intelligent and automated merge
tools.

*ASM Rizvi,John Heidemann,David Plonka*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文通过商业CDN数据分析了移动设备的网络体验，重点关注延迟、吞吐量和稳定性，揭示了移动用户在不同情况下的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着5G时代的到来，移动设备对高性能网络的需求增加，本文旨在通过CDN数据提供中立、全球化的视角，分析移动用户的真实体验。

Method: 利用商业、全球分布的CDN数据，测量移动用户的延迟、吞吐量和稳定性，并与多国运营商的数据进行对比。

Result: 研究发现，移动用户的最低延迟可低至6毫秒，但仅有5%的用户能稳定低于20毫秒；60%的用户吞吐量低于50 Mb/s，而最低延迟在特定地点表现稳定。

Conclusion: 移动网络体验存在显著差异，最低延迟的稳定性可用于异常检测，为未来网络优化提供参考。

Abstract: The web experience using mobile devices is important since a significant
portion of the Internet traffic is initiated from mobile devices. In the era of
5G, users expect a high-performance data network to stream media content and
for other latency-sensitive applications. In this paper, we characterize mobile
experience in terms of latency, throughput, and stability measured from a
commercial, globally-distributed CDN. Unlike prior work, CDN data provides a
relatively neutral, carrier-agnostic perspective, providing a clear view of
multiple and international providers. Our analysis of mobile client traffic
shows mobile users sometimes experience markedly low latency, even as low as 6
ms. However, only the top 5% users regularly experience less than 20 ms of
minimum latency. While 100 Mb/s throughput is not rare, we show around 60%
users observe less than 50 Mb/s throughput. We find the minimum mobile latency
is generally stable at a specific location which can be an important
characteristic for anomaly detection.

Conclusion: LLM方法在数字孪生边缘计算网络中具有潜力，可替代传统MARL框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general digital twin edge computing network
comprising multiple vehicles and a server. Each vehicle generates multiple
computing tasks within a time slot, leading to queuing challenges when
offloading tasks to the server. The study investigates task offloading
strategies, queue stability, and resource allocation. Lyapunov optimization is
employed to transform long-term constraints into tractable short-term
decisions. To solve the resulting problem, an in-context learning approach
based on large language model (LLM) is adopted, replacing the conventional
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LLM-based method achieves comparable or even superior
performance to MARL.

Conclusion: iPLAN为IWN规划带来范式转变，展示了LLM在复杂网络规划中的潜力。

Abstract: Efficient indoor wireless network (IWN) planning is crucial for providing
high-quality 5G in-building services. However, traditional meta-heuristic and
artificial intelligence-based planning methods face significant challenges due
to the intricate interplay between indoor environments (IEs) and IWN demands.
In this article, we present an indoor wireless network Planning with large
LANguage models (iPLAN) framework, which integrates multi-modal IE
representations into large language model (LLM)-powered optimizers to improve
IWN planning. First, we instate the role of LLMs as optimizers, outlining
embedding techniques for IEs, and introducing two core applications of iPLAN:
(i) IWN planning based on pre-existing IEs and (ii) joint design of IWN and IE
for new wireless-friendly buildings. For the former, we embed essential
information into LLM optimizers by leveraging indoor descriptions,
domain-specific knowledge, and performance-driven perception. For the latter,
we conceptualize a multi-agent strategy, where intelligent agents
collaboratively address key planning sub-tasks in a step-by-step manner while
ensuring optimal trade-offs between the agents. The simulation results
demonstrate that iPLAN achieves superior performance in IWN planning tasks and
optimizes building wireless performance through the joint design of IEs and
IWNs, exemplifying a paradigm shift in IWN planning.

Abstract: Wireless support of virtual reality (VR) has challenges when a network has
multiple users, particularly for 3D VR gaming, digital AI avatars, and remote
team collaboration. This work addresses these challenges through investigation
of the low-rank channels that inevitably occur when there are more active users
than there are degrees of spatial freedom, effectively often the number of
antennas. The presented approach uses optimal nonlinear transceivers,
equivalently generalized decision-feedback or successive cancellation for
uplink and superposition or dirty-paper precoders for downlink. Additionally, a
powerful optimization approach for the users' energy allocation and decoding
order appears to provide large improvements over existing methods, effectively
nearing theoretical optima. As the latter optimization methods pose real-time
challenges, approximations using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) are used to
approximate best performance with much lower (5x at least) complexity.
Experimental results show significantly larger sum rates and very large power
savings to attain the data rates found necessary to support VR. Experimental
results show the proposed algorithm outperforms current industry standards like
orthogonal multiple access (OMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), as
well as the highly researched methods in multi-carrier NOMA (MC-NOMA),
enhancing sum data rate by 39%, 28%, and 16%, respectively, at a given power
level. For the same data rate, it achieves power savings of 75%, 45%, and 40%,
making it ideal for VR applications. Additionally, a near-optimal deep
reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation framework for real-time
use by being 5x faster and reaching 83% of the global optimum is introduced.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的方法，用于多接入点协调（MAPC）调度，以最小化网络中的最坏情况延迟。该方法在802.11bn兼容环境中训练DRL代理，显著优于现有启发式策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集Wi-Fi部署中，多接入点协调（MAPC）是提高吞吐量、延迟和可靠性的关键，但现有调度策略在复杂干扰条件下效率不足。

Method: 通过将MAPC调度建模为顺序决策问题，并使用近端策略优化（PPO）训练DRL代理，利用空间复用（SR）组调度多个AP-站点对同时传输。

Result: 仿真显示，该方法在多种网络负载和流量模式下优于现有启发式策略，99%延迟降低高达30%。

Conclusion: 基于DRL的MAPC调度方法能有效优化密集Wi-Fi网络的延迟性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key feature of IEEE 802.11bn,
with a potential impact on future Wi-Fi networks. MAPC enables joint scheduling
decisions across multiple access points (APs) to improve throughput, latency,
and reliability in dense Wi-Fi deployments. However, implementing efficient
scheduling policies under diverse traffic and interference conditions in
overlapping basic service sets (OBSSs) remains a complex task. This paper
presents a method to minimize the network-wide worst-case latency by
formulating MAPC scheduling as a sequential decision-making problem and
proposing a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) mechanism to minimize worst-case
delays in OBSS deployments. Specifically, we train a DRL agent using proximal
policy optimization (PPO) within an 802.11bn-compatible Gymnasium environment.
This environment provides observations of queue states, delay metrics, and
channel conditions, enabling the agent to schedule multiple AP-station pairs to
transmit simultaneously by leveraging spatial reuse (SR) groups. Simulations
demonstrate that our proposed solution outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic
strategies across a wide range of network loads and traffic patterns. The
trained machine learning (ML) models consistently achieve lower 99th-percentile
delays, showing up to a 30% improvement over the best baseline.

Conclusion: 该框架在计算效率和准确性之间取得了良好平衡，适用于多种逆问题，且无需任务特定调整。

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful tools for sampling from high-dimensional
distributions by progressively transforming pure noise into structured data
through a denoising process. When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these
models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper,
a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems
using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise
function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different
approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to
effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance
term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem,
the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of
inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise
into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks,
specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional
diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed
framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting
with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\)
and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only
negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.

Abstract: The rise of online learning has led to the development of various knowledge
tracing (KT) methods. However, existing methods have overlooked the problem of
increasing computational cost when utilizing large graphs and long learning
sequences. To address this issue, we introduce Dual Graph Attention-based
Knowledge Tracing (DGAKT), a graph neural network model designed to leverage
high-order information from subgraphs representing student-exercise-KC
relationships. DGAKT incorporates a subgraph-based approach to enhance
computational efficiency. By processing only relevant subgraphs for each target
interaction, DGAKT significantly reduces memory and computational requirements
compared to full global graph models. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DGAKT not only outperforms existing KT models but also sets a
new standard in resource efficiency, addressing a critical need that has been
largely overlooked by prior KT approaches.

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) with knowledge in both scientific and general
tasks is the foundation of science general intelligence. However, directly
continued pretraining an LLM using science data usually leads to catastrophic
forgetting, which indicates severe degradation in general ability. In this
report, we present Innovator, which solves this problem by upcycling a
pre-trained dense LLM into a fine-grained Mixtures-of-Experts model during
continued pretraining, where different experts are expected to learn science
knowledge in different disciplines, and a shared expert is utilized for general
tasks. Innovator introduces a four-stage upcycle training paradigm: (1)
Scientific Expert Induction on discipline-specific data, (2) Fine-grained
Expert Splitting via FFN dimension decomposition, (3) Science-Aware Routing
warmup, and (4) Generalist-Scientist Integration training on hybrid datasets.
Such a paradigm enables knowledge in the general domain, and different
scientific disciplines can be decoupled, avoiding the negative influence among
knowledge in different domains. With 53.3B total parameters and 13.3B
activated, Innovator extends Qwen2.5-7B using a shared general expert and 64
specialized scientific experts with 8 activated. Trained on 300B tokens with
tri-level quality-controlled data, Innovator achieves 25% average improvement
across 30 scientific tasks with a win rate as 70%, while retaining 99%
performance in general tasks. Furthermore, Innovator-Reason, which is
post-trained from Innovator for reasoning boosting, exhibits excellent
reasoning performance in solving complex scientific problems with improvements
over 30%.

Abstract: This thesis presents the results of a comprehensive research project focused
on applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the problem of market making in
financial markets. Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing
liquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk,
competition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL,
particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop
autonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.
  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning
problem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and
multi-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then
addresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary
approaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning
(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the
latter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing
objectives.
  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,
a novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This
method allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,
enabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.
  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches
significantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across
various performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new
methodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive
market making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic
trading in complex financial systems.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently gained popularity as a way for humans to peek
into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing,
additional classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a
model into human-defined concepts of interest. However, the performance of
these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe
from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In
this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's
representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for
a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular
the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our findings
through an exhaustive empirical analysis over different neural network models
and datasets.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to efficiently eliminate the memory about deleted
data from trained models and address the right to be forgotten. Despite the
success of existing unlearning algorithms, unlearning in sparse models has not
yet been well studied. In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data
has an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the
observation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology
``un-pruning" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we
propose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by
retained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be
integrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is
upper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both
structured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we
further find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for
assessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the
amount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we
devise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of
un-pruning. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of
un-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms. Our code is
released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UnlearningSparseModels-FBC5/.

Abstract: Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are widely used in recommender systems
that require continuous, incremental learning. A core aspect of MABs is the
exploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to
be enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear
bandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the
same linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration
strategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is
increasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration
behavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of
several linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy
linear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier
performance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This
observation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which
consistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that
pure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings.
Our results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for
bandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory
efficacy. Consequently, this research underscores the urgent necessity for
developing more robust assessment methodologies, guiding future investigations
into alternative evaluation frameworks for interactive learning in recommender
systems.

Abstract: Learning representations unaffected by superficial characteristics is
important to ensure that shifts in these characteristics at test time do not
compromise downstream prediction performance. For instance, in healthcare
applications, we might like to learn features that contain information about
pathology yet are unaffected by race, sex, and other sources of physiologic
variability, thereby ensuring predictions are equitable and generalizable
across all demographics. Here we propose Contrastive LEarning with
Anti-contrastive Regularization (CLEAR), an intuitive and easy-to-implement
framework that effectively separates essential (i.e., task-relevant)
characteristics from superficial (i.e., task-irrelevant) characteristics during
training, leading to better performance when superficial characteristics shift
at test time. We begin by supposing that data representations can be
semantically separated into task-relevant content features, which contain
information relevant to downstream tasks, and task-irrelevant style features,
which encompass superficial attributes that are irrelevant to these tasks, yet
may degrade performance due to associations with content present in training
data that do not generalize. We then prove that our anti-contrastive penalty,
which we call Pair-Switching (PS), minimizes the Mutual Information between the
style attributes and content labels. Finally, we instantiate CLEAR in the
latent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), then perform experiments to
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the resulting CLEAR-VAE over several
image datasets. Our results show that CLEAR-VAE allows us to: (a) swap and
interpolate content and style between any pair of samples, and (b) improve
downstream classification performance in the presence of previously unseen
combinations of content and style. Our code will be made publicly available.

### [44] [Ralts: Robust Aggregation for Enhancing Graph Neural Network Resilience on Bit-flip Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18804)
*Wencheng Zou,Nan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了图神经网络（GNNs）在硬件故障（如位翻转错误）下的鲁棒性问题，并提出了一种轻量级解决方案Ralts，通过图相似性度量和保护性聚合函数提升GNN的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs在金融和医疗等安全关键应用中广泛使用，但现有研究主要关注软件层面的威胁，硬件故障的影响尚未充分探索。随着硬件系统向高性能和能效方向发展，瞬态故障（如位翻转）问题日益突出，亟需解决方案。

Method: 论文首先全面分析了GNN对位翻转错误的鲁棒性，随后提出Ralts，利用图相似性度量过滤异常并恢复受损的图拓扑结构，并将保护技术集成到聚合函数中，适用于任何消息传递GNN。

Result: 实验表明，Ralts显著提升了GNN的鲁棒性，在模型权重或节点嵌入中错误存在时，预测准确率平均提高至少20%；在邻接矩阵错误时提高至少10%。Ralts的执行效率与PyTorch Geometric内置聚合函数相当。

Conclusion: Ralts是一种通用且高效的解决方案，能够有效增强GNN对硬件故障的鲁棒性，为未来可靠且高效的GNN系统提供了优化方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in safety-critical
applications, such as financial and medical networks, in which compromised
predictions may cause catastrophic consequences. While existing research on GNN
robustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced
faults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress
toward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency
demands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can
cause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major
technology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a
comprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to
reveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and
efficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and
lightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors.
Specifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out
outliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these
protective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any
message-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively
enhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error
patterns, and both dense and sparse architectures. On average, under a BER of
$3\times10^{-5}$, these robust aggregation functions improve prediction
accuracy by at least 20\% when errors present in model weights or node
embeddings, and by at least 10\% when errors occur in adjacency matrices. Ralts
is also optimized to deliver execution efficiency comparable to built-in
aggregation functions in PyTorch Geometric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G无线网络中，高分辨率获取空间信号（如SINR地图）成本高，传统神经网络方法复杂度高且数据需求大。

Method: 利用Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) 结合代数与几何约束，减少参数数量并提升稀疏数据下的重建性能。

Result: GENEO方法在稀疏采样下表现优于传统方法，通过统计和TDA指标验证了其准确性。

Conclusion: GENEO为稀疏数据下的空间信号重建提供了高效且低复杂度的解决方案。

Abstract: In emerging communication systems such as sixth generation (6G) wireless
networks, efficient resource management and service delivery rely on accurate
knowledge of spatially-varying quantities like signal-to-interference-noise
ratio (SINR) maps, which are costly to acquire at high resolution. This work
explores the reconstruction of such spatial signals from sparse measurements
using Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs), offering a
low-complexity alternative to traditional neural networks. The concept of
GENEO, which originated in topological data analysis (TDA), is a mathematical
tool used in machine learning to represent agents modelled as functional
operators acting on data while incorporating application-specific invariances.
Leveraging these invariances reduces the number of parameters with respect to
traditional neural networks and mitigates data scarcity by enforcing known
algebraic and geometric constraints that reflect symmetries in the agents'
actions. In this paper, we introduce a novel GENEO-based approach for SINR map
reconstruction in urban wireless communication networks using extremely sparse
sampling. We demonstrate that this mathematical framework achieves competitive
performance compared to established methods. Our evaluation, conducted using
both statistical and TDA metrics, highlights the advantages of our approach in
accurately reconstructing spatial signals under severe data limitations on the
number of samples.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“Squisher”的方法，通过复用训练过程中已计算的平方梯度累加器来近似Fisher对角矩阵，以减少计算成本。实验表明其性能与Fisher对角矩阵相当，且优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fisher对角矩阵常用于衡量参数敏感性，但其计算成本较高。自适应梯度方法（如Adam）在训练过程中已计算了平方梯度的移动平均，因此探索是否可以利用这些数据近似Fisher对角矩阵。

Method: 提出“Squisher”方法，复用训练过程中已计算的平方梯度累加器来近似Fisher对角矩阵。通过五项应用实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，Squisher在性能上与Fisher对角矩阵相似，且优于基线方法。同时，论文量化了Squisher与Fisher对角矩阵的具体差异及其影响。

Conclusion: Squisher提供了一种计算高效的Fisher对角矩阵近似方法，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: The diagonal of a model's Fisher Information Matrix (the "Fisher diagonal")
has frequently been used as a way to measure parameter sensitivity. Typically,
the Fisher diagonal is estimated via squared sampled gradients of the model's
likelihood with respect to its parameters, averaged over a few hundred or
thousand examples -- a process which incurs nontrivial computational costs. At
the same time, adaptive gradient methods like the ubiquitous Adam optimizer
compute a moving average of the squared gradient over the course of training.
This paper therefore explores whether an approximation of the Fisher diagonal
can be obtained "for free" by recycling the squared gradient accumulator that
has already been computed over the course of training. Through a comprehensive
set of experiments covering five applications of the Fisher diagonal, we
demonstrate that the "Squisher" (SQUared gradient accumulator as an
approximation of the FISHER) consistently performs similarly to the Fisher
diagonal while outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, we clarify the
exact differences between the Squisher and the Fisher diagonal and provide
empirical quantification of their respective impact.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索如何通过测试时训练（类似基础模型的微调）提升离线强化学习的性能，尤其是在高维导航和操作任务中。

Method: 方法包括提出自监督数据选择标准，从离线数据集中选择与当前状态和评估目标相关的过渡数据，并在测试时进行少量梯度步的微调。

Result: 实验结果表明，GC-TTT算法在多种任务中显著优于标准的离线预训练方法，且计算成本较低。

Conclusion: 结论是测试时微调策略（GC-TTT）在计算成本相近的情况下，能够通过数据选择和动态调整策略实现性能提升，而不仅仅是增加模型规模。

Abstract: Foundation models compress a large amount of information in a single, large
neural network, which can then be queried for individual tasks. There are
strong parallels between this widespread framework and offline goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning algorithms: a universal value function is trained on a
large number of goals, and the policy is evaluated on a single goal in each
test episode. Extensive research in foundation models has shown that
performance can be substantially improved through test-time training,
specializing the model to the current goal. We find similarly that test-time
offline reinforcement learning on experience related to the test goal can lead
to substantially better policies at minimal compute costs. We propose a novel
self-supervised data selection criterion, which selects transitions from an
offline dataset according to their relevance to the current state and quality
with respect to the evaluation goal. We demonstrate across a wide range of
high-dimensional loco-navigation and manipulation tasks that fine-tuning a
policy on the selected data for a few gradient steps leads to significant
performance gains over standard offline pre-training. Our goal-conditioned
test-time training (GC-TTT) algorithm applies this routine in a
receding-horizon fashion during evaluation, adapting the policy to the current
trajectory as it is being rolled out. Finally, we study compute allocation at
inference, demonstrating that, at comparable costs, GC-TTT induces performance
gains that are not achievable by scaling model size.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative neural networks, particularly flow matching
(FM), have enabled the generation of high-fidelity samples while significantly
reducing computational costs. A promising application of these models is
accelerating simulations in high-energy physics (HEP), helping research
institutions meet their increasing computational demands. In this work, we
leverage FM to develop surrogate models for fast simulations of zero degree
calorimeters in the ALICE experiment. We present an effective training strategy
that enables the training of fast generative models with an exceptionally low
number of parameters. This approach achieves state-of-the-art simulation
fidelity for both neutron (ZN) and proton (ZP) detectors, while offering
substantial reductions in computational costs compared to existing methods. Our
FM model achieves a Wasserstein distance of 1.27 for the ZN simulation with an
inference time of 0.46 ms per sample, compared to the current best of 1.20 with
an inference time of approximately 109 ms. The latent FM model further improves
the inference speed, reducing the sampling time to 0.026 ms per sample, with a
minimal trade-off in accuracy. Similarly, our approach achieves a Wasserstein
distance of 1.30 for the ZP simulation, outperforming the current best of 2.08.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have emerged as a promising approach for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) in science and engineering. Previous ML
models typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a
trained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed
Reynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of
PDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of
scales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more
concretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters
and the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to
represent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given
domain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a
scale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a
given domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.
Since neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the
natural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of
neural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the
scale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,
Helmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations. With scale-consistency, the
model trained on $Re$ of 1000 can generalize to $Re$ ranging from 250 to 10000,
and reduces the error by 34% on average of all datasets compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在复杂任务中有效提升了W2SG性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Weak-to-Strong generalization (W2SG) is a new trend to elicit the full
capabilities of a strong model with supervision from a weak model. While
existing W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we
extend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments.
Specifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate
actions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we
propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so
that the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak
models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents,
we further construct ``trajectory trees," a hierarchical representation that
organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis,
we provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving
W2SG performance. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial
improvements in reasoning and decision-making capabilities across diverse task
domains, validating the scalability and robustness of our proposed framework.

Motivation: 高血压肾病ICU患者短期死亡率高，缺乏定制化风险预测工具，需早期识别高风险个体以辅助临床决策。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV v2.2数据库的早期临床数据，筛选18个特征，训练并比较多种模型，CatBoost表现最优。

Abstract: Background: Hypertensive kidney disease (HKD) patients in intensive care
units (ICUs) face high short-term mortality, but tailored risk prediction tools
are lacking. Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for
clinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to
predict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early
clinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was
curated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical
features-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were
selected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several
models were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation;
CatBoost demonstrated the best performance. Results: CatBoost achieved an AUROC
of 0.88 on the independent test set, with sensitivity of 0.811 and specificity
of 0.798. SHAP values and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots showed the
model relied on meaningful predictors such as altered consciousness,
vasopressor use, and coagulation status. Additionally, the DREAM algorithm was
integrated to estimate patient-specific posterior risk distributions, allowing
clinicians to assess both predicted mortality and its uncertainty. Conclusions:
We present an interpretable machine learning pipeline for early, real-time risk
assessment in ICU patients with HKD. By combining high predictive performance
with uncertainty quantification, our model supports individualized triage and
transparent clinical decisions. This approach shows promise for clinical
deployment and merits external validation in broader critical care populations.

Motivation: 多智能体强化学习在稀疏奖励环境下探索效率低，现有方法依赖人工设计的奖励函数，缺乏高阶智能。

Method: 提出LIGHT框架，结合个体动作分布与人类专家偏好分布，设计基于Q学习的个体内在奖励。

Result: 实验表明LIGHT在性能与知识复用性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LIGHT有效整合人类知识，提升MARL在稀疏奖励任务中的表现。

Abstract: Efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a
challenging problem when receiving only a team reward, especially in
environments with sparse rewards. A powerful method to mitigate this issue
involves crafting dense individual rewards to guide the agents toward efficient
exploration. However, individual rewards generally rely on manually engineered
shaping-reward functions that lack high-order intelligence, thus it behaves
ineffectively than humans regarding learning and generalization in complex
problems. To tackle these issues, we combine the above two paradigms and
propose a novel framework, LIGHT (Learning Individual Intrinsic reward via
Incorporating Generalized Human experTise), which can integrate human knowledge
into MARL algorithms in an end-to-end manner. LIGHT guides each agent to avoid
unnecessary exploration by considering both individual action distribution and
human expertise preference distribution. Then, LIGHT designs individual
intrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational
transformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action
preferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over
representative baselines regarding performance and better knowledge reusability
across different sparse-reward tasks on challenging scenarios.

Motivation: 准确预测血脑屏障通透性对中枢神经系统药物开发至关重要，而现有图神经网络（GNNs）常忽略三维几何信息。

Method: GMC-MPNN通过构建基于原子类型的加权彩色子图，捕捉空间关系和化学背景，并结合严格的数据集划分进行评估。

Result: GMC-MPNN在分类和回归任务中均优于现有模型（AUC-ROC达0.9704，RMSE为0.4609）。

Conclusion: GMC-MPNN通过整合空间几何信息，为药物发现提供了更准确且通用的工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) is essential
for central nervous system (CNS) drug development. While graph neural networks
(GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on
molecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information
crucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric
multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework
that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly
incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our
model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the
spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We
evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and
regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust
assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior
performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC
of 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of
0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified
the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's
predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare,
but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry
into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and
offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines.

Conclusion: 通过编码臂的设计，算法在保证安全性的同时，显著提升了性能，为多臂老虎机问题中的信息安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Consider the problem of best arm identification with a security constraint.
Specifically, assume a setup of stochastic linear bandits with $K$ arms of
dimension $d$. In each arm pull, the player receives a reward that is the sum
of the dot product of the arm with an unknown parameter vector and independent
noise. The player's goal is to identify the best arm after $T$ arm pulls.
Moreover, assume a copycat Chloe is observing the arm pulls. The player wishes
to keep Chloe ignorant of the best arm.
  While a minimax--optimal algorithm identifies the best arm with an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log(d)}\right)$ error exponent, it easily reveals its
best-arm estimate to an outside observer, as the best arms are played more
frequently. A naive secure algorithm that plays all arms equally results in an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{d}\right)$ exponent. In this paper, we propose a secure
algorithm that plays with \emph{coded arms}. The algorithm does not require any
key or cryptographic primitives, yet achieves an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log^2(d)}\right)$ exponent while revealing almost no
information on the best arm.

Abstract: Forecasting in financial markets remains a significant challenge due to their
nonlinear and regime-dependent dynamics. Traditional deep learning models, such
as long short-term memory networks and multilayer perceptrons, often struggle
to generalize across shifting market conditions, highlighting the need for a
more adaptive and interpretable approach. To address this, we introduce
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for stock prediction and explainable regimes
(KASPER), a novel framework that integrates regime detection, sparse
spline-based function modeling, and symbolic rule extraction. The framework
identifies hidden market conditions using a Gumbel-Softmax-based mechanism,
enabling regime-specific forecasting. For each regime, it employs
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with sparse spline activations to capture intricate
price behaviors while maintaining robustness. Interpretability is achieved
through symbolic learning based on Monte Carlo Shapley values, which extracts
human-readable rules tailored to each regime. Applied to real-world financial
time series from Yahoo Finance, the model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.89, a
Sharpe Ratio of 12.02, and a mean squared error as low as 0.0001, outperforming
existing methods. This research establishes a new direction for regime-aware,
transparent, and robust forecasting in financial markets.

Abstract: Differentiated thyroid cancer DTC recurrence is a major public health
concern, requiring classification and predictive models that are not only
accurate but also interpretable and uncertainty aware. This study introduces a
comprehensive framework for DTC recurrence classification using a dataset
containing 383 patients and 16 clinical and pathological variables. Initially,
11 machine learning ML models were employed using the complete dataset, where
the Support Vector Machines SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9481.
To reduce complexity and redundancy, feature selection was carried out using
the Boruta algorithm, and the same ML models were applied to the reduced
dataset, where it was observed that the Logistic Regression LR model obtained
the maximum accuracy of 0.9611. However, these ML models often lack uncertainty
quantification, which is critical in clinical decision making. Therefore, to
address this limitation, the Bayesian Neural Networks BNN with six varying
prior distributions, including Normal 0,1, Normal 0,10, Laplace 0,1, Cauchy
0,1, Cauchy 0,2.5, and Horseshoe 1, were implemented on both the complete and
reduced datasets. The BNN model with Normal 0,10 prior distribution exhibited
maximum accuracies of 0.9740 and 0.9870 before and after feature selection,
respectively.

Abstract: As AI workloads proliferate, optimizing arithmetic units is becoming
increasingly important to reduce the footprint of digital systems. Conventional
design flows, which often rely on manual or heuristics-based optimization, are
limited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast design space. In this
paper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the
automatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically
multipliers.
  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two
stages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised
finetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area
from abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model,
GENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize
power consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.
Extensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently
more sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards
optimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis
optimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.
Notably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%
switching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads
compared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the
versatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite
State Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of
logic functions. Together, these advances mark a significant step toward
automated Quality-of-Results-optimized combinational circuit generation for
digital systems.

Motivation: 现实世界中的强化学习应用常因环境反馈延迟而受限，尤其是随机延迟环境因其多变性和不可预测性尚未被充分研究。

Method: 提出保守智能体，将随机延迟环境重新表述为恒定延迟等效环境，无需修改算法结构即可应用现有方法。

Result: 在连续控制任务中，保守智能体在渐近性能和样本效率上显著优于基线算法。

Conclusion: 保守智能体为随机延迟环境提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案，扩展了现有方法的适用范围。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning applications are often hindered by delayed
feedback from environments, which violates the Markov assumption and introduces
significant challenges. Although numerous delay-compensating methods have been
proposed for environments with constant delays, environments with random delays
remain largely unexplored due to their inherent variability and
unpredictability. In this study, we propose a simple yet robust agent for
decision-making under random delays, termed the conservative agent, which
reformulates the random-delay environment into its constant-delay equivalent.
This transformation enables any state-of-the-art constant-delay method to be
directly extended to the random-delay environments without modifying the
algorithmic structure or sacrificing performance. We evaluate the conservative
agent-based algorithm on continuous control tasks, and empirical results
demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing baseline algorithms in
terms of asymptotic performance and sample efficiency.

TL;DR: FADE是一个轻量级框架，用于在动态环境中进行鲁棒学习，通过Fisher信息几何和KL散度检测分布变化，无需任务边界或目标监督，在多种基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态环境中输入分布随时间变化（SCS）的问题，提出一种无需任务边界或目标监督的适应方法。

Method: 使用Fisher信息几何的移位感知正则化机制，结合KL散度和时间Fisher动态检测分布变化。

Result: 在七种基准测试中，FADE在严重移位下准确率提高19%，优于TENT和DIW方法，并适用于联邦学习。

Conclusion: FADE是一种高效、理论支持的方法，适用于多种模态和移位强度的动态环境。

Abstract: Modern machine learning systems operating in dynamic environments often face
\textit{sequential covariate shift} (SCS), where input distributions evolve
over time while the conditional distribution remains stable. We introduce FADE
(Fisher-based Adaptation to Dynamic Environments), a lightweight and
theoretically grounded framework for robust learning under SCS. FADE employs a
shift-aware regularization mechanism anchored in Fisher information geometry,
guiding adaptation by modulating parameter updates based on sensitivity and
stability. To detect significant distribution changes, we propose a
Cramer-Rao-informed shift signal that integrates KL divergence with temporal
Fisher dynamics. Unlike prior methods requiring task boundaries, target
supervision, or experience replay, FADE operates online with fixed memory and
no access to target labels. Evaluated on seven benchmarks spanning vision,
language, and tabular data, FADE achieves up to 19\% higher accuracy under
severe shifts, outperforming methods such as TENT and DIW. FADE also
generalizes naturally to federated learning by treating heterogeneous clients
as temporally fragmented environments, enabling scalable and stable adaptation
in decentralized settings. Theoretical analysis guarantees bounded regret and
parameter consistency, while empirical results demonstrate FADE's robustness
across modalities and shift intensities.

Conclusion: 该方法在生成金融时间序列时优于传统扩散模型，更符合实际观测到的金融现象。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based generative framework for financial time
series that incorporates geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the foundation of the
Black--Scholes theory, into the forward noising process. Unlike standard
score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical
sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time
step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By
accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting
log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential
equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The
reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a
Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based
Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical
stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts
heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage
effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.

Conclusion: MindSpeed RL通过系统优化显著提升了强化学习训练的效率和性能，并展示了Ascend NPU的强大能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm increasingly used to align large
language models. Popular RL algorithms utilize multiple workers and can be
modeled as a graph, where each node is the status of a worker and each edge
represents dataflow between nodes. Owing to the heavy cross-node dependencies,
the RL training system usually suffers from poor cluster scalability and low
memory utilization. In this article, we introduce MindSpeed RL, an effective
and efficient system for large-scale RL training. Unlike existing centralized
methods, MindSpeed RL organizes the essential data dependencies in RL training,
i.e., sample flow and resharding flow, from a distributed view. On the one
hand, a distributed transfer dock strategy, which sets controllers and
warehouses on the basis of the conventional replay buffer, is designed to
release the dispatch overhead in the sample flow. A practical allgather--swap
strategy is presented to eliminate redundant memory usage in resharding flow.
In addition, MindSpeed RL further integrates numerous parallelization
strategies and acceleration techniques for systematic optimization. Compared
with existing state-of-the-art systems, comprehensive experiments on the RL
training of popular Qwen2.5-Dense-7B/32B, Qwen3-MoE-30B, and
DeepSeek-R1-MoE-671B show that MindSpeed RL increases the throughput by 1.42 ~
3.97 times. Finally, we open--source MindSpeed RL and perform all the
experiments on a super pod of Ascend with 384 neural processing units (NPUs) to
demonstrate the powerful performance and reliability of Ascend.

Motivation: 现有G2M方法无法动态调整推理成本和精度，限制了其在资源多变场景中的应用。

Method: 采用渐进式训练结构（PTS）、渐进式知识蒸馏（PKD）和渐进式混合增强（PMA）来优化蒸馏过程。

Result: 在八个真实图数据集上验证，ProGMLP能动态适应不同运行时场景，保持高精度。

Conclusion: ProGMLP在多样应用场景中高效且灵活，适合资源受限环境。

Abstract: GNN-to-MLP (G2M) methods have emerged as a promising approach to accelerate
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by distilling their knowledge into simpler
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). These methods bridge the gap between the
expressive power of GNNs and the computational efficiency of MLPs, making them
well-suited for resource-constrained environments. However, existing G2M
methods are limited by their inability to flexibly adjust inference cost and
accuracy dynamically, a critical requirement for real-world applications where
computational resources and time constraints can vary significantly. To address
this, we introduce a Progressive framework designed to offer flexible and
on-demand trade-offs between inference cost and accuracy for GNN-to-MLP
knowledge distillation (ProGMLP). ProGMLP employs a Progressive Training
Structure (PTS), where multiple MLP students are trained in sequence, each
building on the previous one. Furthermore, ProGMLP incorporates Progressive
Knowledge Distillation (PKD) to iteratively refine the distillation process
from GNNs to MLPs, and Progressive Mixup Augmentation (PMA) to enhance
generalization by progressively generating harder mixed samples. Our approach
is validated through comprehensive experiments on eight real-world graph
datasets, demonstrating that ProGMLP maintains high accuracy while dynamically
adapting to varying runtime scenarios, making it highly effective for
deployment in diverse application settings.

Abstract: Forecasting system behaviour near and across bifurcations is crucial for
identifying potential shifts in dynamical systems. While machine learning has
recently been used to learn critical transitions and bifurcation structures
from data, most studies remain limited as they exclusively focus on
discrete-time methods and local bifurcations. To address these limitations, we
use Neural Ordinary Differential Equations which provide a continuous,
data-driven framework for learning system dynamics. We apply our approach to a
predator-prey system that features both local and global bifurcations,
presenting a challenging test case. Our results show that Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations can recover underlying bifurcation structures directly
from timeseries data by learning parameter-dependent vector fields. Notably, we
demonstrate that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can forecast
bifurcations even beyond the parameter regions represented in the training
data. We also assess the method's performance under limited and noisy data
conditions, finding that model accuracy depends more on the quality of
information that can be inferred from the training data, than on the amount of
data available.

Conclusion: DyRC-VG框架通过动态信息优化储备网络结构，显著提升了复杂时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a
challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir
computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional
deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly
structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely
random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized
networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a
novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that
systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input
training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG)
technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing
measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network
is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data
sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid
expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is
directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study.
We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical
nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency.
Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and
comparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent
performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG.

Abstract: Molecular assembly offers a promising path to detect life beyond Earth, while
minimizing assumptions based on terrestrial life. As mass spectrometers will be
central to upcoming Solar System missions, predicting molecular assembly from
their data without needing to elucidate unknown structures will be essential
for unbiased life detection. An ideal agnostic biosignature must be
interpretable and experimentally measurable. Here, we show that molecular
assembly, a recently developed approach to measure objects that have been
produced by evolution, satisfies both criteria. First, it is interpretable for
life detection, as it reflects the assembly of molecules with their bonds as
building blocks, in contrast to approaches that discount construction history.
Second, it can be determined without structural elucidation, as it can be
physically measured by mass spectrometry, a property that distinguishes it from
other approaches that use structure-based information measures for molecular
complexity. Whilst molecular assembly is directly measurable using mass
spectrometry data, there are limits imposed by mission constraints. To address
this, we developed a machine learning model that predicts molecular assembly
with high accuracy, reducing error by three-fold compared to baseline models.
Simulated data shows that even small instrumental inconsistencies can double
model error, emphasizing the need for standardization. These results suggest
that standardized mass spectrometry databases could enable accurate molecular
assembly prediction, without structural elucidation, providing a
proof-of-concept for future astrobiology missions.

Result: 实验证明CGIR优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CGIR通过子簇搜索与合并，统一实现了节点填补和嵌入优化。

Abstract: Attribute-missing graph clustering has emerged as a significant unsupervised
task, where only attribute vectors of partial nodes are available and the graph
structure is intact. The related models generally follow the two-step paradigm
of imputation and refinement. However, most imputation approaches fail to
capture class-relevant semantic information, leading to sub-optimal imputation
for clustering. Moreover, existing refinement strategies optimize the learned
embedding through graph reconstruction, while neglecting the fact that some
attributes are uncorrelated with the graph. To remedy the problems, we
establish the Clustering-oriented Generative Imputation with reliable
Refinement (CGIR) model. Concretely, the subcluster distributions are estimated
to reveal the class-specific characteristics precisely, and constrain the
sampling space of the generative adversarial module, such that the imputation
nodes are impelled to align with the correct clusters. Afterwards, multiple
subclusters are merged to guide the proposed edge attention network, which
identifies the edge-wise attributes for each class, so as to avoid the
redundant attributes in graph reconstruction from disturbing the refinement of
overall embedding. To sum up, CGIR splits attribute-missing graph clustering
into the search and mergence of subclusters, which guides to implement node
imputation and refinement within a unified framework. Extensive experiments
prove the advantages of CGIR over state-of-the-art competitors.

Abstract: Attributed graph clustering holds significant importance in modern data
analysis. However, due to the complexity of graph data and the heterogeneity of
node attributes, leveraging graph information for clustering remains
challenging. To address this, we propose a novel deep graph clustering model,
GCL-GCN, specifically designed to address the limitations of existing models in
capturing local dependencies and complex structures when dealing with sparse
and heterogeneous graph data. GCL-GCN introduces an innovative Graphormer
module that combines centrality encoding and spatial relationships, effectively
capturing both global and local information between nodes, thereby enhancing
the quality of node representations. Additionally, we propose a novel
contrastive learning module that significantly enhances the discriminative
power of feature representations. In the pre-training phase, this module
increases feature distinction through contrastive learning on the original
feature matrix, ensuring more identifiable initial representations for
subsequent graph convolution and clustering tasks. Extensive experimental
results on six datasets demonstrate that GCL-GCN outperforms 14 advanced
methods in terms of clustering quality and robustness. Specifically, on the
Cora dataset, it improves ACC, NMI, and ARI by 4.94%, 13.01%, and 10.97%,
respectively, compared to the primary comparison method MBN.

Abstract: Ensuring privacy in large-scale open datasets is increasingly challenging
under regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While
differential privacy (DP) provides strong theoretical guarantees, it primarily
focuses on noise injection during model training, neglecting privacy
preservation at the data publishing stage. Existing privacy-preserving data
publishing (PPDP) approaches struggle to balance privacy and utility,
particularly when data publishers and users are distinct entities. To address
this gap, we focus on the graph recovery problem and propose a novel
privacy-preserving estimation framework for open graph data, leveraging
Gaussian DP (GDP) with a structured noise-injection mechanism. Unlike
traditional methods that perturb gradients or model updates, our approach
ensures unbiased graph structure recovery while enforcing DP at the data
publishing stage. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees on estimation
accuracy and extend our method to discrete-variable graphs, a setting often
overlooked in DP research. Experimental results in graph learning demonstrate
robust performance, offering a viable solution for privacy-conscious graph
analysis.

Abstract: Accurate detection and localization of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in
satellite imagery is essential for optimizing microgrids and active
distribution networks (ADNs), which are critical components of renewable energy
systems. Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying
algorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data,
and struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental
conditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to
inconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and
data-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language
models (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. Despite their
promise, LLMs face several challenges in solar panel detection, including
difficulties with multi-step logical processes, inconsistent output formatting,
frequent misclassification of visually similar objects (e.g., shadows, parking
lots), and low accuracy in complex tasks such as spatial localization and
quantification. To overcome these issues, we propose the PV Assessment with
LLMs (PVAL) framework, which incorporates task decomposition for more efficient
workflows, output standardization for consistent and scalable formatting,
few-shot prompting to enhance classification accuracy, and fine-tuning using
curated PV datasets with detailed annotations. PVAL ensures transparency,
scalability, and adaptability across heterogeneous datasets while minimizing
computational overhead. By combining open-source accessibility with robust
methodologies, PVAL establishes an automated and reproducible pipeline for
solar panel detection, paving the way for large-scale renewable energy
integration and optimized grid management.

Abstract: Commercial high-voltage circuit breaker (CB) condition monitoring systems
rely on directly observable physical parameters such as gas filling pressure
with pre-defined thresholds. While these parameters are crucial, they only
cover a small subset of malfunctioning mechanisms and usually can be monitored
only if the CB is disconnected from the grid. To facilitate online condition
monitoring while CBs remain connected, non-intrusive measurement techniques
such as vibration or acoustic signals are necessary. Currently, CB condition
monitoring studies using these signals typically utilize supervised methods for
fault diagnostics, where ground-truth fault types are known due to artificially
introduced faults in laboratory settings. This supervised approach is however
not feasible in real-world applications, where fault labels are unavailable. In
this work, we propose a novel unsupervised fault detection and segmentation
framework for CBs based on vibration and acoustic signals. This framework can
detect deviations from the healthy state. The explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) approach is applied to the detected faults for fault
diagnostics. The specific contributions are: (1) we propose an integrated
unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework that is capable of
detecting faults and clustering different faults with only healthy data
required during training (2) we provide an unsupervised explainability-guided
fault diagnostics approach using XAI to offer domain experts potential
indications of the aged or faulty components, achieving fault diagnostics
without the prerequisite of ground-truth fault labels. These contributions are
validated using an experimental dataset from a high-voltage CB under healthy
and artificially introduced fault conditions, contributing to more reliable CB
system operation.

improving patient outcomes, and novel approaches are needed to facilitate early
diagnosis. In this study, we explore the use of automatic cough analysis as a
pre-screening tool for distinguishing between NSCLC patients and healthy
controls. Cough audio recordings were prospectively acquired from a total of
227 subjects, divided into NSCLC patients and healthy controls. The recordings
were analyzed using machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine
(SVM) and XGBoost, as well as deep learning approaches, specifically
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning with VGG16. To
enhance the interpretability of the machine learning model, we utilized Shapley
Additive Explanations (SHAP). The fairness of the models across demographic
groups was assessed by comparing the performance of the best model across
different age groups (less than or equal to 58y and higher than 58y) and gender
using the equalized odds difference on the test set. The results demonstrate
that CNN achieves the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.83 on the test
set. Nevertheless, SVM achieves slightly lower performances (accuracy of 0.76
in validation and 0.78 in the test set), making it suitable in contexts with
low computational power. The use of SHAP for SVM interpretation further
enhances model transparency, making it more trustworthy for clinical
applications. Fairness analysis shows slightly higher disparity across age
(0.15) than gender (0.09) on the test set. Therefore, to strengthen our
findings' reliability, a larger, more diverse, and unbiased dataset is needed
-- particularly including individuals at risk of NSCLC and those in early
disease stages.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于注意力机制的弱感知通道注意力（WACA）方法，用于高效预测VLSI设计中的IR压降问题，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模拟的IR压降预测方法计算成本高且难以扩展，而现有学习方法未能充分利用输入通道的异质性。

Method: 将IR压降预测重新定义为像素级回归任务，提出WACA机制，通过两阶段门控策略增强弱特征通道并抑制过强通道，结合ConvNeXtV2注意力U-Net实现自适应特征表示。

Result: 在ICCAD-2023基准测试中，平均绝对误差降低61.1%，F1分数提升71.0%，优于竞赛冠军方法。

Conclusion: 通道异质性是VLSI物理布局分析的关键归纳偏差，WACA机制为高效预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate spatial prediction of power integrity issues, such as IR drop, is
critical for reliable VLSI design. However, traditional simulation-based
solvers are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. We address this
challenge by reformulating IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task
on heterogeneous multi-channel physical maps derived from circuit layouts.
Prior learning-based methods treat all input layers (e.g., metal, via, and
current maps) equally, ignoring their varying importance to prediction
accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention
(WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while
suppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy. Integrated
into a ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net, our approach enables adaptive and
balanced feature representation. On the public ICCAD-2023 benchmark, our method
outperforms the ICCAD-2023 contest winner by reducing mean absolute error by
61.1% and improving F1-score by 71.0%. These results demonstrate that
channel-wise heterogeneity is a key inductive bias in physical layout analysis
for VLSI.

TL;DR: 提出了一种物理信息图神经网络框架，通过四种图构建策略和新型消息传递层，实现了高效准确的粒子横向动量估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态机器学习模型在高堆积条件下性能下降及通用图神经网络忽视领域结构的问题。

Method: 采用四种图构建策略（如站点为节点、特征为节点等）结合消息传递层和领域特定损失函数。

Result: 在CMS触发数据集上验证，实现了0.8525的MAE，参数比基线少55%以上。

Conclusion: 物理引导的GNN在资源受限的触发系统中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Real-time particle transverse momentum ($p_T$) estimation in high-energy
physics demands algorithms that are both efficient and accurate under strict
hardware constraints. Static machine learning models degrade under high pileup
and lack physics-aware optimization, while generic graph neural networks (GNNs)
often neglect domain structure critical for robust $p_T$ regression. We propose
a physics-informed GNN framework that systematically encodes detector geometry
and physical observables through four distinct graph construction strategies
that systematically encode detector geometry and physical observables:
station-as-node, feature-as-node, bending angle-centric, and pseudorapidity
($\eta$)-centric representations. This framework integrates these tailored
graph structures with a novel Message Passing Layer (MPL), featuring
intra-message attention and gated updates, and domain-specific loss functions
incorporating $p_{T}$-distribution priors. Our co-design methodology yields
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing baselines.
Extensive experiments on the CMS Trigger Dataset validate the approach: a
station-informed EdgeConv model achieves a state-of-the-art MAE of 0.8525 with
$\ge55\%$ fewer parameters than deep learning baselines, especially TabNet,
while an $\eta$-centric MPL configuration also demonstrates improved accuracy
with comparable efficiency. These results establish the promise of
physics-guided GNNs for deployment in resource-constrained trigger systems.

Motivation: 现有生成模型在合成表格数据时难以保留特征间的确定性关联（FDs和LDs），限制了数据在隐私敏感领域的应用。

Method: 提出HFGF框架，首先生成独立特征，再根据预定义的FD和LD规则重建依赖特征。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证，HFGF显著提升了六种生成模型（如CTGAN、TVAE）对FDs和LDs的保留能力。

Conclusion: HFGF能显著提升合成数据的结构保真度和下游实用性。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is increasingly used in privacy-sensitive domains such
as health care, but existing generative models often fail to preserve
inter-attribute relationships. In particular, functional dependencies (FDs) and
logical dependencies (LDs), which capture deterministic and rule-based
associations between features, are rarely or often poorly retained in synthetic
datasets. To address this research gap, we propose the Hierarchical Feature
Generation Framework (HFGF) for synthetic tabular data generation. We created
benchmark datasets with known dependencies to evaluate our proposed HFGF. The
framework first generates independent features using any standard generative
model, and then reconstructs dependent features based on predefined FD and LD
rules. Our experiments on four benchmark datasets with varying sizes, feature
imbalance, and dependency complexity demonstrate that HFGF improves the
preservation of FDs and LDs across six generative models, including CTGAN,
TVAE, and GReaT. Our findings demonstrate that HFGF can significantly enhance
the structural fidelity and downstream utility of synthetic tabular data.

Motivation: 传统CFD模拟计算量大，难以用于实时或设计迭代工作流，需要一种高效预测方法。

Method: 采用三种神经网络：带残差连接的卷积自编码器（CAER）提取特征，多层感知机（MLP）映射入口速度到潜在表示，卷积神经网络（CNN）聚合单入口特征到双入口场景。

Result: CBML模型在训练和测试数据上均能准确快速地预测双组分聚合速度和温度场。

Conclusion: CBML方法为室内气流和温度分布预测提供了一种高效替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of indoor airflow and temperature
distributions is essential for building energy optimization and occupant
comfort control. However, traditional CFD simulations are computationally
intensive, limiting their integration into real-time or design-iterative
workflows. This study proposes a component-based machine learning (CBML)
surrogate modeling approach to replace conventional CFD simulation for fast
prediction of indoor velocity and temperature fields. The model consists of
three neural networks: a convolutional autoencoder with residual connections
(CAER) to extract and compress flow features, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
map inlet velocities to latent representations, and a convolutional neural
network (CNN) as an aggregator to combine single-inlet features into dual-inlet
scenarios. A two-dimensional room with varying left and right air inlet
velocities is used as a benchmark case, with CFD simulations providing training
and testing data. Results show that the CBML model accurately and fast predicts
two-component aggregated velocity and temperature fields across both training
and testing datasets.

Motivation: 尽管自回归语言模型在实践中表现出色，但其简单目标（NLL）为何能产生如此多功能表示的理论基础尚不明确。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用马尔可夫范畴（MCs）和统计散度，分解自回归生成过程和NLL目标，分析信息流和学习到的几何结构。

Result: 1. 为现代推测解码方法（如EAGLE）提供信息论解释；2. 形式化NLL如何学习数据的条件随机性；3. 证明NLL训练隐含地实现谱对比学习。

Conclusion: 通过信息几何视角，揭示了现代语言模型有效性的深层结构原理。

Abstract: Auto-regressive language models factorize sequence probabilities and are
trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective. While
empirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple
objective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work
introduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to
deconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the
single-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category
Stoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,
allows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes
three main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic
rationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,
quantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods
exploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn
not just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a
process we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we
prove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive
learning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,
we show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align
with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a
geometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This
compositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural
principles underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page:

Motivation: 高质量表格数据稀缺，现有方法依赖密集建模导致偏差和计算开销高。

Result: 在四个数据集上，SPADA比扩散方法减少4%约束违规，生成速度比LLM基线快近9,500倍。

Conclusion: SPADA通过稀疏依赖建模高效解决表格数据增强问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Tabular data is critical across diverse domains, yet high-quality datasets
remain scarce due to privacy concerns and the cost of collection. Contemporary
approaches adopt large language models (LLMs) for tabular augmentation, but
exhibit two major limitations: (1) dense dependency modeling among tabular
features that can introduce bias, and (2) high computational overhead in
sampling. To address these issues, we propose SPADA for SPArse
Dependency-driven Augmentation, a lightweight generative framework that
explicitly captures sparse dependencies via an LLM-induced graph. We treat each
feature as a node and synthesize values by traversing the graph, conditioning
each feature solely on its parent nodes. We explore two synthesis strategies: a
non-parametric method using Gaussian kernel density estimation, and a
conditional normalizing flow model that learns invertible mappings for
conditional density estimation. Experiments on four datasets show that SPADA
reduces constraint violations by 4% compared to diffusion-based methods and
accelerates generation by nearly 9,500 times over LLM-based baselines.

Conclusion: 多模态视觉语言模型能有效解决短形式视频推荐中的挑战。

Abstract: In recent years, social media users have spent significant amounts of time on
short-form video platforms. As a result, established platforms in other
domains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to
engage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of
these experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI
innovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms
actively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new
challenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video
experience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences
introduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when
optimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos. These
issues, together with the feedback loop inherent in recommender systems, make
it difficult to build effective solutions. In this paper, we highlight the
challenges faced when introducing a new short-form video experience and present
our experience showing that, even with sufficient video interaction data, it
can be more beneficial to leverage a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned
multimodal vision-language model to overcome these challenges. This approach
demonstrated greater effectiveness compared to conventional supervised learning
methods in online experiments conducted on our e-commerce platform.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is increasingly leveraged across various domains to
automate decision-making processes that significantly impact human lives. In
medical image analysis, deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable
performance. However, their inherent complexity makes them black box systems,
raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. Counterfactual
explanations provide comprehensible insights into decision processes by
presenting hypothetical "what-if" scenarios that alter model classifications.
By examining input alterations, counterfactual explanations provide patterns
that influence the decision-making process. Despite their potential, generating
plausible counterfactuals that adhere to similarity constraints providing
human-interpretable explanations remains a challenge. In this paper, we
investigate this challenge by a model-specific optimization approach. While
deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) exhibit
significant generative power, probabilistic models like sum-product networks
(SPNs) efficiently represent complex joint probability distributions. By
modeling the likelihood of a semi-supervised VAE's latent space with an SPN, we
leverage its dual role as both a latent space descriptor and a classifier for a
given discrimination task. This formulation enables the optimization of latent
space counterfactuals that are both close to the original data distribution and
aligned with the target class distribution. We conduct experimental evaluation
on the cheXpert dataset. To evaluate the effectiveness of the integration of
SPNs, our SPN-guided latent space manipulation is compared against a neural
network baseline. Additionally, the trade-off between latent variable
regularization and counterfactual quality is analyzed.

Abstract: The increasing complexity and volume of financial transactions pose
significant challenges to traditional fraud detection systems. This technical
report investigates and compares the efficacy of classical, quantum, and
quantum-hybrid machine learning models for the binary classification of
fraudulent financial activities.
  As of our methodology, first, we develop a comprehensive behavioural feature
engineering framework to transform raw transactional data into a rich,
descriptive feature set. Second, we implement and evaluate a range of models on
the IBM Anti-Money Laundering (AML) dataset. The classical baseline models
include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These
are compared against three hybrid classic quantum algorithms architectures: a
Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC),
and a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN).
  Furthermore, we propose Fraud Detection for Quantum Computing (FD4QC), a
practical, API-driven system architecture designed for real-world deployment,
featuring a classical-first, quantum-enhanced philosophy with robust fallback
mechanisms.
  Our results demonstrate that classical tree-based models, particularly
\textit{Random Forest}, significantly outperform the quantum counterparts in
the current setup, achieving high accuracy (\(97.34\%\)) and F-measure
(\(86.95\%\)). Among the quantum models, \textbf{QSVM} shows the most promise,
delivering high precision (\(77.15\%\)) and a low false-positive rate
(\(1.36\%\)), albeit with lower recall and significant computational overhead.
  This report provides a benchmark for a real-world financial application,
highlights the current limitations of quantum machine learning in this domain,
and outlines promising directions for future research.

Result: 标准验证指标无法识别唯一最优模型；小规模集成模型能减少预测不一致性；模型精度提高可降低多重性。

Abstract: Model multiplicity refers to the existence of multiple machine learning
models that describe the data equally well but may produce different
predictions on individual samples. In medicine, these models can admit
conflicting predictions for the same patient -- a risk that is poorly
understood and insufficiently addressed.
  In this study, we empirically analyze the extent, drivers, and ramifications
of predictive multiplicity across diverse medical tasks and model
architectures, and show that even small ensembles can mitigate/eliminate
predictive multiplicity in practice. Our analysis reveals that (1) standard
validation metrics fail to identify a uniquely optimal model and (2) a
substantial amount of predictions hinges on arbitrary choices made during model
development. Using multiple models instead of a single model reveals instances
where predictions differ across equally plausible models -- highlighting
patients that would receive arbitrary diagnoses if any single model were used.
In contrast, (3) a small ensemble paired with an abstention strategy can
effectively mitigate measurable predictive multiplicity in practice;
predictions with high inter-model consensus may thus be amenable to automated
classification. While accuracy is not a principled antidote to predictive
multiplicity, we find that (4) higher accuracy achieved through increased model
capacity reduces predictive multiplicity.
  Our findings underscore the clinical importance of accounting for model
multiplicity and advocate for ensemble-based strategies to improve diagnostic
reliability. In cases where models fail to reach sufficient consensus, we
recommend deferring decisions to expert review.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖名义资本或表面活动，导致风险分析不准确，需要更动态、全面的LP评估方法。

Method: 利用链上事件日志和智能合约执行痕迹计算指数时间加权流动性（ETWL），并通过无监督异常检测定义流动性稳定性影响分数（LSIS）。

Result: SILS能更精确识别高影响力LPs，减少误报和漏报，支持DeFi生态的保护性预言机和交易信号。

Conclusion: SILS为DeFi协议提供了主动风险管理机制，显著提升市场稳定性和透明度。

Abstract: Traditional methods for identifying impactful liquidity providers (LPs) in
Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) rely on broad measures, such as
nominal capital size or surface-level activity, which often lead to inaccurate
risk analysis. The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed
approach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic
systemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents
a fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a
dynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain
event logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential
Time-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly
detection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through
the Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that
measures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This
combined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an
LP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used
by existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables
SILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by
traditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective
oracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing
DeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the
underlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the
common false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in
traditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for
proactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their
ecosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior.

Result: Step-3显著降低了理论解码成本，在长上下文中表现更优，每令牌激活38B参数，解码吞吐量达4039令牌/秒/GPU。

Conclusion: Step-3通过硬件对齐的注意力算术强度、MoE稀疏性和AFD，实现了成本效益的突破，为LLM解码设定了新的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face low hardware efficiency during decoding,
especially for long-context reasoning tasks. This paper introduces Step-3, a
321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for
minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel
Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces
both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention
expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed
inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers
into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost
efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared
with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at
longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per
token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that
hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are
critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with
DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs
achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under
50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324
in the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.

Motivation: 解决强化学习代理在训练范围外部署时捕捉潜在变化（上下文）的问题。

Method: 提出双重推理-控制框架，定义观察充分性和控制充分性，并设计基于变分信息瓶颈的BCPO算法。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，BCPO表现优于基线方法，且样本效率更高，泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于上下文的强化学习提供了理论、诊断和实践的统一方法。

Abstract: Capturing latent variations ("contexts") is key to deploying
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents beyond their training regime. We recast
context-based RL as a dual inference-control problem and formally characterize
two properties and their hierarchy: observation sufficiency (preserving all
predictive information) and control sufficiency (retaining decision-making
relevant information). Exploiting this dichotomy, we derive a contextual
evidence lower bound(ELBO)-style objective that cleanly separates
representation learning from policy learning and optimizes it with Bottlenecked
Contextual Policy Optimization (BCPO), an algorithm that places a variational
information-bottleneck encoder in front of any off-policy policy learner. On
standard continuous-control benchmarks with shifting physical parameters, BCPO
matches or surpasses other baselines while using fewer samples and retaining
performance far outside the training regime. The framework unifies theory,
diagnostics, and practice for context-based RL.

TL;DR: Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC) 是一种针对随机森林的模型解释方法，通过分组实例揭示局部和全局结构，提升可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在敏感领域的应用增加，对可解释和可信决策的需求上升。随机森林因其集成特性难以解释。

Method: FGC 通过分组实例并分析共享决策路径，生成人类可理解的簇，计算簇级和全局特征重要性。

Result: FGC 在基准数据集上准确恢复潜在子类结构，优于传统聚类和后解释方法；在AML转录组数据中发现生物学相关子群。

Conclusion: FGC 填补了性能与可解释性之间的鸿沟，提供超越特征归因的结构感知洞察。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in sensitive application
areas, the demand for interpretable and trustworthy decision-making has
increased. Random Forests (RF), despite their widespread use and strong
performance on tabular data, remain difficult to interpret due to their
ensemble nature. We present Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC), a model-specific
explainability method that reveals both local and global structure in RFs by
grouping instances according to shared decision paths. FGC produces
human-interpretable clusters aligned with the model's internal logic and
computes cluster-specific and global feature importance scores to derive
decision rules underlying RF predictions. FGC accurately recovered latent
subclass structure on a benchmark dataset and outperformed classical clustering
and post-hoc explanation methods. Applied to an AML transcriptomic dataset, FGC
uncovered biologically coherent subpopulations, disentangled disease-relevant
signals from confounders, and recovered known and novel gene expression
patterns. FGC bridges the gap between performance and interpretability by
providing structure-aware insights that go beyond feature-level attribution.

TL;DR: 近期研究表明，先进的大语言模型（LLMs）在事件预测方面已接近超级预测者水平，强化学习等技术进一步提升了预测能力。本文提出大规模训练超级预测者级事件预测LLMs的时机已成熟，并探讨了训练方法和数据获取两大方向。

Result: 技术进展可能使AI在更广泛领域为社会提供预测智能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了接近超级预测者级AI技术的具体路径和考量，旨在呼吁研究者关注这些方向。

Abstract: Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast
doubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved
evaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching
superforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been
reported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success
of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that
technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been
developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the
time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training
methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three
difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,
knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present
related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,
utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward
signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling
datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how
these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to
society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths
and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology,
aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.

TL;DR: 比较了基于图神经网络的区域机器学习天气预测（MLWP）模型中的有限区域模型（LAM）和拉伸网格模型（SGM），发现两者在预测性能上相当，但各有优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LAM和SGM两种模型设计对区域天气预测性能的影响，为气象机构选择适合的模型提供指导。

Method: 使用Anemoi框架，通过最小化调整共享架构构建LAM和SGM模型，并在相同设置下训练和测试。

Result: LAM和SGM在预测性能上表现相当，但LAM依赖高质量边界数据，SGM则更具通用性和操作便利性。

Conclusion: LAM适合全球数据获取困难的情况，而SGM更易于操作且泛化能力更强，为气象机构提供了选择依据。

Abstract: Regional machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) models based on graph
neural networks have recently demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy,
outperforming numerical weather prediction models at lower computational costs.
In particular, limited-area model (LAM) and stretched-grid model (SGM)
approaches have emerged for generating high-resolution regional forecasts,
based on initial conditions from a regional (re)analysis. While LAM uses
lateral boundaries from an external global model, SGM incorporates a global
domain at lower resolution. This study aims to understand how the differences
in model design impact relative performance and potential applications.
Specifically, the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches are
identified for generating deterministic regional forecasts over Europe. Using
the Anemoi framework, models of both types are built by minimally adapting a
shared architecture and trained using global and regional reanalyses in a
near-identical setup. Several inference experiments have been conducted to
explore their relative performance and highlight key differences. Results show
that both LAM and SGM are competitive deterministic MLWP models with generally
accurate and comparable forecasting performance over the regional domain.
Various differences were identified in the performance of the models across
applications. LAM is able to successfully exploit high-quality boundary
forcings to make predictions within the regional domain and is suitable in
contexts where global data is difficult to acquire. SGM is fully self-contained
for easier operationalisation, can take advantage of more training data and
significantly surpasses LAM in terms of (temporal) generalisability. Our paper
can serve as a starting point for meteorological institutes to guide their
choice between LAM and SGM in developing an operational data-driven forecasting
system.

*Takuya Inoue,Takuya Kawabata*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种将卷积神经网络（CNN）与集合数值天气预报（NWP）模型结合的方法，用于提高中范围（超过五天）地表温度预测的准确性。通过CNN后处理（偏差校正和空间超分辨率）和集合平均，有效减少了系统性和随机误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于计算资源有限，中范围温度预测通常依赖低分辨率NWP模型，这些模型容易产生系统性和随机误差。研究旨在通过CNN和集合平均的结合解决这一问题。

Method: 方法包括两步：1）通过CNN对每个集合成员进行后处理（偏差校正和空间超分辨率），从低分辨率输出重建高分辨率温度场；2）通过集合平均减少随机误差。还比较了CNN校正与集合平均的顺序对预测准确性的影响。

Result: 研究发现，先进行CNN校正再进行集合平均的方法比相反顺序更准确。该方法显著优于高分辨率确定性NWP模型。

Conclusion: 结合CNN校正和集合平均能有效减少NWP模型的系统性和随机误差，是一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，尤其适用于计算资源有限的操作中心。

Abstract: This study proposes a method that integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) with ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, enabling
surface temperature forecasting at lead times beyond the short-range (five-day)
forecast period. Owing to limited computational resources, operational
medium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models,
which are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations,
the proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based
post-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble
member, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution
model outputs. Second, it reduces random errors through ensemble averaging of
the CNN-corrected members. This study also investigates whether the sequence of
CNN correction and ensemble averaging affects the forecast accuracy. For
comparison with the proposed method, we additionally conducted experiments with
the CNN trained on ensemble-averaged forecasts. The first approach--CNN
correction before ensemble averaging--consistently achieved higher accuracy
than the reverse approach. Although based on low-resolution ensemble forecasts,
the proposed method notably outperformed the high-resolution deterministic NWP
models. These findings indicate that combining CNN-based correction with
ensemble averaging effectively reduces both the systematic and random errors in
NWP model outputs. The proposed approach is a practical and scalable solution
for improving medium-range temperature forecasts, and is particularly valuable
at operational centers with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Decompiling Rust binaries is challenging due to the language's rich type

decompilation quality across core Rust features and compiler build modes. Our
automated scoring framework shows that generic types, trait methods, and error

release builds. Through representative case studies, we analyze how specific
language constructs affect control flow, variable naming, and type information
recovery. Our findings provide actionable insights for tool developers and
highlight the need for Rust-aware decompilation strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将Python类型系统子集嵌入ACL2s的方法，用于生成输入以模糊测试Python程序，并识别未被现有类型检查器发现的错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python作为行业标准语言，其代码的静态分析和测试工具仍有不足，尤其是类型检查器无法覆盖所有错误。本文旨在通过ACL2s增强对Python代码的推理能力。

Method: 开发了Python类型系统子集的ACL2s嵌入，包括常见类型注解和用户定义类型，并利用defdata枚举器生成输入以模糊测试Python程序。

Result: 在四个开源仓库中测试，代码覆盖率达68%至80%以上，并识别了阻碍覆盖率的代码模式（如复杂分支条件和外部依赖）。

Conclusion: 结果表明该方法有效，未来可扩展支持更多Python类型和优化覆盖率。

Abstract: Python is a high-level interpreted language that has become an industry
standard in a wide variety of applications. In this paper, we take a first step
towards using ACL2s to reason about Python code by developing an embedding of a
subset of the Python type system in ACL2s. The subset of Python types we
support includes many of the most commonly used type annotations as well as
user-defined types comprised of supported types. We provide ACL2s definitions
of these types, as well as defdata enumerators that are customized to provide
code coverage and identify errors in Python programs. Using the ACL2s
embedding, we can generate instances of types that can then be used as inputs
to fuzz Python programs, which allows us to identify bugs in Python code that
are not detected by state-of-the-art Python type checkers. We evaluate our work
against four open-source repositories, extracting their type information and
generating inputs for fuzzing functions with type signatures that are in the
supported subset of Python types. Note that we only use the type signatures of
functions to generate inputs and treat the bodies of functions as black boxes.
We measure code coverage, which ranges from about 68% to more than 80%, and
identify code patterns that hinder coverage such as complex branch conditions
and external file system dependencies. We conclude with a discussion of the
results and recommendations for future work.

Motivation: 探索活性极性流体中拓扑缺陷的动态控制，揭示拓扑、流动和非平衡流体动力学之间的相互作用。

Method: 采用连续流体动力学模型，通过局部调控活性应力生成流场，结合强化学习框架设计控制策略。

Result: 成功实现缺陷沿预定轨迹的定向运动，并验证了控制策略的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AI代理可以学习并操纵活性物质中的拓扑激发，为可控活性物质和自适应材料设计提供新思路。

Abstract: Topological defects in active polar fluids exhibit complex dynamics driven by
internally generated stresses, reflecting the deep interplay between topology,
flow, and non-equilibrium hydrodynamics. Feedback control offers a powerful
means to guide such systems, enabling transitions between dynamic states. We
investigated closed-loop steering of integer-charged defects in a confined
active fluid by modulating the spatial profile of activity. Using a continuum
hydrodynamic model, we show that localized control of active stress induces
flow fields that can reposition and direct defects along prescribed
trajectories by exploiting non-linear couplings in the system. A reinforcement
learning framework is used to discover effective control strategies that
produce robust defect transport across both trained and novel trajectories. The
results highlight how AI agents can learn the underlying dynamics and spatially
structure activity to manipulate topological excitations, offering insights
into the controllability of active matter and the design of adaptive,
self-organized materials.

Motivation: 随着电动汽车行业对高纯度锂需求的增长，如何经济地从北美低品位资源（如Smackover Formation）中提取锂成为关键。这些资源需要创新的纯化技术。

Method: 研究引入了一种“人在环路”（HITL）辅助的主动学习框架，结合人类专业知识和数据驱动优化连续结晶过程。

Result: 该框架显著提高了对关键杂质（如镁）的容忍度，从行业标准的几百ppm提升至6000ppm，使低品位锂资源的利用成为可能。

Conclusion: 这一突破为经济利用北美丰富的锂资源（如Smackover Formation）提供了可能，增强了全球锂供应链的可持续性。

Abstract: As demand for high-purity lithium surges with the growth of the electric
vehicle (EV) industry, cost-effective extraction from lower-grade North
American sources like the Smackover Formation is critical. These resources,
unlike high-purity South American brines, require innovative purification
techniques to be economically viable. Continuous crystallization is a promising
method for producing battery-grade lithium carbonate, but its optimization is
challenged by a complex parameter space and limited data. This study introduces
a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) assisted active learning framework to optimize the
continuous crystallization of lithium carbonate. By integrating human expertise
with data-driven insights, our approach accelerates the optimization of lithium
extraction from challenging sources. Our results demonstrate the framework's
ability to rapidly adapt to new data, significantly improving the process's
tolerance to critical impurities like magnesium from the industry standard of a
few hundred ppm to as high as 6000 ppm. This breakthrough makes the
exploitation of low-grade, impurity-rich lithium resources feasible,
potentially reducing the need for extensive pre-refinement processes. By
leveraging artificial intelligence, we have refined operational parameters and
demonstrated that lower-grade materials can be used without sacrificing product
quality. This advancement is a significant step towards economically harnessing
North America's vast lithium reserves, such as those in the Smackover
Formation, and enhancing the sustainability of the global lithium supply chain.

State-of-the-art models are generally graph neural networks that employ message

Using this we propose a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method and

Motivation: 由于Sargassum藻筏运动的高维非线性特性，缺乏预测其质心运动的规律，需要机器学习方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用LSTM和SINDy两种方法，基于eBOMB模型进行物理启发的闭合建模。LSTM学习从eBOMB变量到藻筏质心与海洋速度差异的映射，SINDy通过函数库识别显式关系。

Result: 两种方法在紧密连接的藻筏条件下表现最佳，LSTM在简单设计中效果最好，SINDy提供了更高的可解释性。

Conclusion: LSTM和SINDy各有优势，LSTM适合简单设计，SINDy适合需要透明度的场景，非局部相互作用建模效果显著。

Abstract: Since 2011, rafts of floating \emph{Sargassum} seaweed have frequently
obstructed the coasts of the Intra-Americas Seas. The motion of the rafts is
represented by a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. Referred to as
the eBOMB model, this builds on the Maxey--Riley equation by incorporating
interactions between clumps of \emph{Sargassum} forming a raft and the effects
of Earth's rotation. The absence of a predictive law for the rafts' centers of
mass suggests a need for machine learning. In this paper, we evaluate and
contrast Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and
Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). In both cases, a
physics-inspired closure modeling approach is taken rooted in eBOMB.
Specifically, the LSTM model learns a mapping from a collection of eBOMB
variables to the difference between raft center-of-mass and ocean velocities.
The SINDy model's library of candidate functions is suggested by eBOMB
variables and includes windowed velocity terms incorporating far-field effects
of the carrying flow. Both LSTM and SINDy models perform most effectively in
conditions with tightly bonded clumps, despite declining precision with rising
complexity, such as with wind effects and when assessing loosely connected
clumps. The LSTM model delivered the best results when designs were
straightforward, with fewer neurons and hidden layers. While LSTM model serves
as an opaque black-box model lacking interpretability, the SINDy model brings
transparency by discerning explicit functional relationships through the
function libraries. Integration of the windowed velocity terms enabled
effective modeling of nonlocal interactions, particularly in datasets featuring
sparsely connected rafts.

Method: 使用强化学习训练零雷诺数下的游泳者，设计不同间距的刚性桨叶。

Result: 紧间距时出现类似生物的同步波划动，宽间距时选择其他模式；最快划动取决于桨叶数量，但最有效的是后向前同步波划动。

Conclusion: 同步波划动在效率上最优，但最快划动模式因桨叶数量而异。

Abstract: Metachronal paddling is a swimming strategy in which an organism oscillates
sets of adjacent limbs with a constant phase lag, propagating a metachronal
wave through its limbs and propelling it forward. This limb coordination
strategy is utilized by swimmers across a wide range of Reynolds numbers, which
suggests that this metachronal rhythm was selected for its optimality of
swimming performance. In this study, we apply reinforcement learning to a
swimmer at zero Reynolds number and investigate whether the learning algorithm
selects this metachronal rhythm, or if other coordination patterns emerge. We
design the swimmer agent with an elongated body and pairs of straight,
inflexible paddles placed along the body for various fixed paddle spacings.
Based on paddle spacing, the swimmer agent learns qualitatively different
coordination patterns. At tight spacings, a back-to-front metachronal wave-like
stroke emerges which resembles the commonly observed biological rhythm, but at
wide spacings, different limb coordinations are selected. Across all resulting
strokes, the fastest stroke is dependent on the number of paddles, however, the
most efficient stroke is a back-to-front wave-like stroke regardless of the
number of paddles.

Method: 提出RailX架构，结合节点内直接连接和节点间电路交换，利用哈密顿分解理论组织环形拓扑为全连接拓扑。

Result: RailX可连接10万+芯片，带宽高且跳数少，成本仅为Fat-Tree的10%~50%。

Conclusion: RailX在超大规模AI工作负载中具有显著的成本和性能优势，适用于MLaaS场景。

Abstract: Increasingly large AI workloads are calling for hyper-scale infrastructure;
however, traditional interconnection network architecture is neither scalable
nor cost-effective enough. Tree-based topologies such as the
\textit{Rail-optimized} network are extremely expensive, while direct
topologies such as \textit{Torus} have insufficient bisection bandwidth and
flexibility. In this paper, we propose \textit{RailX}, a reconfigurable network
architecture based on intra-node direct connectivity and inter-node circuit
switching. Nodes and optical switches are physically 2D-organized, achieving
better scalability than existing centralized circuit switching networks. We
propose a novel interconnection method based on \textit{Hamiltonian
Decomposition} theory to organize separate rail-based rings into
\textit{all-to-all} topology, simultaneously optimizing ring-collective and
all-to-all communication. More than $100$K chips with hyper bandwidth can be
interconnected with a flat switching layer, and the diameter is only $2\sim4$
inter-node hops. The network cost per injection/All-Reduce bandwidth of
\textit{RailX} is less than $10\%$ of the Fat-Tree, and the cost per
bisection/All-to-All bandwidth is less than $50\%$ of the Fat-Tree.
Specifically, only $\sim$\$$1.3$B is required to interconnect 200K chips with
1.8TB bandwidth. \textit{RailX} can also be used in the ML-as-a-service (MLaaS)
scenario, where single or multiple training workloads with various shapes,

Abstract: Infrastructure asset management is essential for sustaining the performance
of public infrastructure such as road networks, bridges, and utility networks.
Traditional maintenance and rehabilitation planning methods often face
scalability and computational challenges, particularly for large-scale networks
with thousands of assets under budget constraints. This paper presents a novel
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that optimizes asset management
strategies for large infrastructure networks. By decomposing the network-level
Markov Decision Process (MDP) into individual asset-level MDPs while using a
unified neural network architecture, the proposed framework reduces
computational complexity, improves learning efficiency, and enhances
scalability. The framework directly incorporates annual budget constraints
through a budget allocation mechanism, ensuring maintenance plans are both
optimal and cost-effective. Through a case study on a large-scale pavement
network of 68,800 segments, the proposed DRL framework demonstrates significant
improvements over traditional methods like Progressive Linear Programming and
genetic algorithms, both in efficiency and network performance. This
advancement contributes to infrastructure asset management and the broader
application of reinforcement learning in complex, large-scale environments.

### [99] [Linearly Convergent Algorithms for Nonsmooth Problems with Unknown Smooth Pieces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19465)
*Zhe Zhang,Suvrit Sra*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对未知分区的分段光滑（PWS）函数优化的高效算法，首次实现了全局线性收敛，并扩展至近似PWS函数和弱凸PWS问题，同时引入了首个可验证的终止准则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分段光滑函数优化在未知分区的情况下缺乏高效算法和可靠的终止准则，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用束水平（BL）方法实现全局线性收敛，并扩展至近似PWS和弱凸问题，同时提出基于猜测-检查框架的终止准则搜索子程序。

Result: 算法在满足二次增长（QG）条件下实现全局线性收敛，复杂度达到平滑非凸优化的基准，且终止准则无需问题参数即可评估。

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法和终止准则为PWS优化提供了高效且几乎无需参数的解决方案，显著推进了该领域的研究。

Abstract: We develop efficient algorithms for optimizing piecewise smooth (PWS)
functions where the underlying partition of the domain into smooth pieces is
\emph{unknown}. For PWS functions satisfying a quadratic growth (QG) condition,
we propose a bundle-level (BL) type method that achieves global linear
convergence -- to our knowledge, the first such result for any algorithm for
this problem class. We extend this method to handle approximately PWS functions
and to solve weakly-convex PWS problems, improving the state-of-the-art
complexity to match the benchmark for smooth non-convex optimization.
Furthermore, we introduce the first verifiable and accurate termination
criterion for PWS optimization. Similar to the gradient norm in smooth
optimization, this certificate tightly characterizes the optimality gap under
the QG condition, and can moreover be evaluated without knowledge of any
problem parameters. We develop a search subroutine for this certificate and
embed it within a guess-and-check framework, resulting in an almost
parameter-free algorithm for both the convex QG and weakly-convex settings.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在推荐系统中使用共享内容特征（'语义ID'）来减少嵌入参数，提升推荐准确性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统为每个物品学习唯一嵌入参数，占用大量内存，限制了模型复杂度。

Method: 采用共享内容特征（语义ID）减少嵌入参数，同时增加模型复杂度。

Result: 在两个音乐推荐数据集上，共享特征提升了推荐准确性和多样性，并减少了模型大小。

Conclusion: 共享内容特征是一种有效的轻量化推荐系统方法，同时提升性能。

Abstract: Training recommender systems for next-item recommendation often requires
unique embeddings to be learned for each item, which may take up most of the
trainable parameters for a model. Shared embeddings, such as using content
information, can reduce the number of distinct embeddings to be stored in
memory. This allows for a more lightweight model; correspondingly, model
complexity can be increased due to having fewer embeddings to store in memory.
We show the benefit of using shared content-based features ('semantic IDs') in
improving recommendation accuracy and diversity, while reducing model size, for
two music recommendation datasets, including an online A/B test on a music
streaming service.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Agent0是一个基于LLM的多任务代理系统，用于自动化信息提取和特征构建，特别适用于推荐系统中的特征工程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM框架在数据为中心的研究中应用不足，尤其是自动化特征提取方面存在挑战。

Method: Agent0通过协调多个LLM代理，结合动态反馈循环的自动提示工程调优方法，实现高效特征发现。

Result: 实验证明该闭环方法在自动化特征发现中既实用又高效。

Conclusion: Agent0为推荐系统开发中的特征工程难题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their associated agent-based frameworks have
significantly advanced automated information extraction, a critical component
of modern recommender systems. While these multitask frameworks are widely used
in code generation, their application in data-centric research is still largely
untapped. This paper presents Agent0, an LLM-driven, agent-based system
designed to automate information extraction and feature construction from raw,
unstructured text. Categorical features are crucial for large-scale recommender
systems but are often expensive to acquire. Agent0 coordinates a group of
interacting LLM agents to automatically identify the most valuable text aspects
for subsequent tasks (such as models or AutoML pipelines). Beyond its feature
engineering capabilities, Agent0 also offers an automated prompt-engineering
tuning method that utilizes dynamic feedback loops from an oracle. Our findings
demonstrate that this closed-loop methodology is both practical and effective
for automated feature discovery, which is recognized as one of the most
challenging phases in current recommender system development.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将大型语言模型（LLM）的效用判断能力蒸馏到更小、更高效模型中的方法，以解决RAG中效用检索的高计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RAG中，效用检索虽然能提升答案质量，但使用LLM进行效用判断的计算成本过高，限制了复杂查询的处理能力。

Method: 通过训练学生模型从教师LLM学习伪答案生成和效用判断，采用动态窗口方法选择有用段落。

Result: 实验表明，效用选择显著降低了计算成本并提升了答案质量，尤其在复杂问题上优于相关性排序。

Conclusion: 效用选择为RAG提供了一种灵活且经济的解决方案，支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating retrieved information. Standard retrieval process prioritized
relevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In
contrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the
usefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical
evidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high
computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of
passages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries
requiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to
distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient
models. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking,
enabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the
need for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer
generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window
method that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate
that utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution
for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer
quality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher
model for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into
RankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex
questions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in
enhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking
and utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting
further research in this area.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法，通过引入可训练的小增量来改进冷启动问题的推荐系统，避免完全冻结或过度微调内容嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决冷启动问题中内容嵌入冻结或微调导致的性能不佳问题。

Method: 在冻结的内容嵌入上引入可训练的小增量，使模型能适应推荐任务而不偏离原始语义结构。

Result: 在多个数据集和模态上表现一致改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了适应性与语义保留，提升了冷启动推荐性能。

Abstract: Many sequential recommender systems suffer from the cold start problem, where
items with few or no interactions cannot be effectively used by the model due
to the absence of a trained embedding. Content-based approaches, which leverage
item metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use
embeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as
initialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content
embeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt
to the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can
degrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far
from their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to
address this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or
fine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen
embeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting
them go too far from their original semantic structure. This approach
demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple datasets and modalities,
including e-commerce datasets with textual descriptions and a music dataset
with audio-based representation.

TL;DR: ReCoDe是一个结合优化控制器和多智能体强化学习的混合框架，通过学习动态约束改进专家控制器，提升多智能体导航任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体环境中，手工设计的约束可能无法满足复杂协调需求，因此需要一种更灵活的方法来改进现有控制器。

Method: ReCoDe通过局部通信学习动态约束，结合优化控制器和强化学习，动态调整对控制器的依赖程度。

Result: 在需要复杂协调的多智能体导航任务中，ReCoDe优于手工控制器、其他混合方法和标准MARL基线。

Conclusion: 保留用户定义的控制器并动态调整其依赖程度，比从头学习更高效，ReCoDe为此提供了理论和实证支持。

Abstract: Constraint-based optimization is a cornerstone of robotics, enabling the
design of controllers that reliably encode task and safety requirements such as
collision avoidance or formation adherence. However, handcrafted constraints
can fail in multi-agent settings that demand complex coordination. We introduce
ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid
framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with
the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding
expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic
constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent
movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local
communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to
coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus
on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate,
context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely
handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines.
We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a
user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than
learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the
degree to which it relies on this controller.

Motivation: 解决现有神经伴随方法在OMT逆设计中的可扩展性和多样性不足问题。

Method: 引入新的前向神经网络架构和材料损失函数，并提出F-RAM特征可视化方法。

Result: ENA方法在准确性和多样性上优于Res-GLOnet，且F-RAM验证了其可解释性。

Conclusion: ENA框架在OMT逆设计中表现出高效、多样、可扩展和可解释的特点。

Abstract: We propose an extended neural adjoint (ENA) framework, which meets six key
criteria for artificial intelligence-assisted inverse design of optical
multilayer thin films (OMTs): accuracy, efficiency, diversity, scalability,
flexibility, and interpretability. To enhance the scalability of the existing
neural adjoint method, we present a novel forward neural network architecture
for OMTs and introduce a material loss function into the existing neural
adjoint loss function, facilitating the exploration of material configurations
of OMTs. Furthermore, we present the detailed formulation of the regression
activation mapping for the presented forward neural network architecture
(F-RAM), a feature visualization method aimed at improving interpretability. We
validated the efficacy of the material loss by conducting an ablation study,
where each component of the loss function is systematically removed and
evaluated. The results indicated that the inclusion of the material loss
significantly improves accuracy and diversity. To substantiate the performance
of the ENA-based inverse design, we compared it against the residual
network-based global optimization network (Res-GLOnet). The ENA yielded the OMT
solutions of an inverse design with higher accuracy and better diversity
compared to the Res-GLOnet. To demonstrate the interpretability, we applied
F-RAM to diverse OMT structures with similar optical properties, obtained by
the proposed ENA method. We showed that distributions of feature importance for
various OMT structures exhibiting analogous optical properties are consistent,
despite variations in material configurations, layer number, and thicknesses.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility of the ENA method by restricting
the initial layer of OMTs to SiO2 and 100 nm.

Result: 证明了随机循环因子平均有O((n log d)/d)个循环，改进了之前的结果，并提供了多项式时间算法。

Conclusion: 结果在常数因子内是紧的，为相关猜想和问题提供了进展。

Abstract: It is a classical result that a random permutation of $n$ elements has, on
average, about $\log n$ cycles. We generalise this fact to all directed
$d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices by showing that, on average, a random
cycle-factor of such a graph has $\mathcal{O}((n\log d)/d)$ cycles. This is
tight up to the constant factor and improves the best previous bound of the
form $\mathcal{O}(n/\sqrt{\log d})$ due to Vishnoi. Our results also yield
randomised polynomial-time algorithms for finding such a cycle-factor and for
finding a tour of length $(1+\mathcal{O}((\log d)/d)) \cdot n$ if the graph is
connected. This makes progress on a conjecture of Magnant and Martin and on a
problem studied by Vishnoi and by Feige, Ravi, and Singh. Our proof uses the
language of entropy to exploit the fact that the upper and lower bounds on the
number of perfect matchings in regular bipartite graphs are extremely close.

Result: 成功证明Floodsub是Broadcastsub的模拟细化，首次实现现实世界发布/订阅协议的机械化验证。

Conclusion: Floodsub的正确性通过机械化验证得到确认，为类似协议的验证提供了新方法。

Abstract: Floodsub is a simple, robust and popular peer-to-peer publish/subscribe
(pubsub) protocol, where nodes can arbitrarily leave or join the network,
subscribe to or unsubscribe from topics and forward newly received messages to
all of their neighbors, except the sender or the originating peer. To show the
correctness of Floodsub, we propose its specification: Broadcastsub, in which
implementation details like network connections and neighbor subscriptions are
elided. To show that Floodsub does really implement Broadcastsub, one would
have to show that the two systems have related infinite computations. We prove
this by reasoning locally about states and their successors using Well-Founded
Simulation (WFS). In this paper, we focus on the mechanization of a proof which
shows that Floodsub is a simulation refinement of Broadcastsub using WFS. To
the best of our knowledge, ours is the first mechanized refinement-based
verification of a real world pubsub protocol.

Conclusion: 该框架为可持续且公平的能源社区提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Fair and dynamic energy allocation in community microgrids remains a critical
challenge, particularly when serving socio-economically diverse participants.
Static optimization and cost-sharing methods often fail to adapt to evolving
inequities, leading to participant dissatisfaction and unsustainable
cooperation. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), cooperative game
theory, and a dynamic equity-adjustment mechanism driven by reinforcement
learning (RL). At its core, the framework utilizes a bi-level optimization
model grounded in Equity-regarding Welfare Maximization (EqWM) principles,
which incorporate Rawlsian fairness to prioritize the welfare of the least
advantaged participants. We introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent that dynamically adjusts socio-economic weights in the optimization
objective based on observed inequities in cost and renewable energy access.
This RL-powered feedback loop enables the system to learn and adapt,
continuously striving for a more equitable state. To ensure transparency,
Explainable AI (XAI) is used to interpret the benefit allocations derived from
a weighted Shapley value. Validated across six realistic scenarios, the
framework demonstrates peak demand reductions of up to 72.6%, and significant
cooperative gains. The adaptive RL mechanism further reduces the Gini
coefficient over time, showcasing a pathway to truly sustainable and fair
energy communities.

Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) are powerful neural-network ans\"atzes
that have emerged as promising tools for studying quantum many-body physics
through the lens of the variational principle. These architectures are known to
be systematically improvable by increasing the number of parameters. Here we
demonstrate an Adaptive scheme to optimize NQSs, through the example of
recurrent neural networks (RNN), using a fraction of the computation cost while
reducing training fluctuations and improving the quality of variational
calculations targeting ground states of prototypical models in one- and
two-spatial dimensions. This Adaptive technique reduces the computational cost
through training small RNNs and reusing them to initialize larger RNNs. This
work opens up the possibility for optimizing graphical processing unit (GPU)
resources deployed in large-scale NQS simulations.

Abstract: The design of accurate Digital Twins (DTs) of electromagnetic environments
strictly depends on the fidelity of the underlying environmental modeling.
Evaluating the differences among diverse levels of modeling accuracy is key to
determine the relevance of the model features towards both efficient and
accurate DT simulations. In this paper, we propose two metrics, the Hausdorff
ray tracing (HRT) and chamfer ray tracing (CRT) distances, to consistently
compare the temporal, angular and power features between two ray tracing
simulations performed on 3D scenarios featured by environmental changes. To
evaluate the introduced metrics, we considered a high-fidelity digital twin
model of an area of Milan, Italy and we enriched it with two different types of
environmental changes: (i) the inclusion of parked vehicles meshes, and (ii)
the segmentation of the buildings facade faces to separate the windows mesh
components from the rest of the building. We performed grid-based and vehicular
ray tracing simulations at 28 GHz carrier frequency on the obtained scenarios
integrating the NVIDIA Sionna RT ray tracing simulator with the SUMO vehicular
traffic simulator. Both the HRT and CRT metrics highlighted the areas of the
scenarios where the simulated radio propagation features differ owing to the
introduced mesh integrations, while the vehicular ray tracing simulations
allowed to uncover the distance patterns arising along realistic vehicular
trajectories.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for discrete multiresolution analysis of graph
signals. The main analytical tool is the samplet transform, originally defined
in the Euclidean framework as a discrete wavelet-like construction, tailored to
the analysis of scattered data. The first contribution of this work is defining
samplets on graphs. To this end, we subdivide the graph into a fixed number of
patches, embed each patch into a Euclidean space, where we construct samplets,
and eventually pull the construction back to the graph. This ensures
orthogonality, locality, and the vanishing moments property with respect to
properly defined polynomial spaces on graphs. Compared to classical Haar
wavelets, this framework broadens the class of graph signals that can
efficiently be compressed and analyzed. Along this line, we provide a
definition of a class of signals that can be compressed using our construction.
We support our findings with different examples of signals defined on graphs
whose vertices lie on smooth manifolds. For efficient numerical implementation,
we combine heavy edge clustering, to partition the graph into meaningful
patches, with landmark \texttt{Isomap}, which provides low-dimensional
embeddings for each patch. Our results demonstrate the method's robustness,
scalability, and ability to yield sparse representations with controllable
approximation error, significantly outperforming traditional Haar wavelet
approaches in terms of compression efficiency and multiresolution fidelity.

Abstract: Given i.i.d.\ samples $X_n =\{ x_1, \dots, x_n \}$ from a distribution
supported on a low dimensional manifold ${M}$ embedded in Eucliden space, we
consider the graph Laplacian operator $\Delta_n$ associated to an
$\varepsilon$-proximity graph over $X_n$ and study the asymptotic fluctuations
of its eigenvalues around their means. In particular, letting
$\hat{\lambda}_l^\varepsilon$ denote the $l$-th eigenvalue of $\Delta_n$, and
under suitable assumptions on the data generating model and on the rate of
decay of $\varepsilon$, we prove that $\sqrt{n } (\hat{\lambda}_{l}^\varepsilon
- \mathbb{E}[\hat{\lambda}_{l}^\varepsilon] )$ is asymptotically Gaussian with
a variance that we can explicitly characterize. A formal argument allows us to
interpret this asymptotic variance as the dissipation of a gradient flow of a
suitable energy with respect to the Fisher-Rao geometry. This geometric
interpretation allows us to give, in turn, a statistical interpretation of the
asymptotic variance in terms of a Cramer-Rao lower bound for the estimation of
the eigenvalues of certain weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator. The latter
interpretation suggests a form of asymptotic statistical efficiency for the
eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian. We also present CLTs for multiple
eigenvalues and through several numerical experiments explore the validity of
our results when some of the assumptions that we make in our theoretical
analysis are relaxed.

Abstract: The discovery of causal relationships is a foundational problem in artificial
intelligence, statistics, epidemiology, economics, and beyond. While elegant
theories exist for accurate causal discovery given infinite data, real-world
applications are inherently resource-constrained. Effective methods for
inferring causal relationships from observational data must perform well under
finite data and time constraints, where "performing well" implies achieving
high, though not perfect accuracy. In his seminal paper A Theory of the
Learnable, Valiant highlighted the importance of resource constraints in
supervised machine learning, introducing the concept of Probably Approximately
Correct (PAC) learning as an alternative to exact learning. Inspired by
Valiant's work, we propose the Probably Approximately Correct Causal (PACC)
Discovery framework, which extends PAC learning principles to the causal field.
This framework emphasizes both computational and sample efficiency for
established causal methods such as propensity score techniques and instrumental
variable approaches. Furthermore, we show that it can also provide theoretical
guarantees for other widely used methods, such as the Self-Controlled Case
Series (SCCS) method, which had previously lacked such guarantees.

Motivation: 现有方法需要网络足够密集，而新方法通过整合所有层的信息，解决了稀疏网络中的聚类问题。

Result: 新方法在稀疏条件下实现了完美聚类，且理论结果与计算下界一致。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏网络中表现优越，扩展了现有模型的适用性。

Abstract: The paper studies the DIverse MultiPLEx Signed Generalized Random Dot Product
Graph (DIMPLE-SGRDPG) network model (Pensky (2024)), where all layers of the
network have the same collection of nodes. In addition, all layers can be
partitioned into groups such that the layers in the same group are embedded in
the same ambient subspace but otherwise matrices of connection probabilities
can be all different. This setting includes majority of multilayer network
models as its particular cases. The key task in this model is to recover the
groups of layers with unique subspace structures, since the case where all
layers of the network are embedded in the same subspace has been fairly well
studied. Until now, clustering of layers in such networks was based on the
layer-per-layer analysis, which required the multilayer network to be
sufficiently dense. Nevertheless, in this paper we succeeded in pooling
information in all layers together and providing a tensor-based methodology
that ensures perfect clustering for a much sparser network. Our theoretical
results, established under intuitive non-restrictive assumptions, assert that
the new technique achieves perfect clustering under sparsity conditions that,
up to logarithmic factors, coincide with the computational lower bound derived
for a much simpler model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生活中计算机和网络的重要性日益增加，但现有安全措施主要针对外部威胁，对内部攻击的防护不足。

Method: 通过利用LAN的未使用IP地址和HTTP协议，演示了外部机器如何绕过防火墙和IDS访问内部网络。

Result: 研究发现，即使有强大的外部保护措施，内部攻击仍能成功，暴露了内部威胁防护的不足。

Conclusion: 论文强调了改进内部安全措施的必要性，以应对日益复杂的内部攻击。

Abstract: Computers and computer networks have become integral to virtually every
aspect of modern life, with the Internet playing an indispensable role.
Organizations, businesses, and individuals now store vast amounts of
proprietary, confidential, and personal data digitally. As such, ensuring the
security of this data from unauthorized access is critical. Common security
measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion
prevention systems (IPS), and antivirus software, are constantly evolving to
safeguard computer systems and networks. However, these tools primarily focus
on defending against external threats, leaving systems vulnerable to insider
attacks. Security solutions designed to mitigate risks originating from within
the organization are relatively limited and often ineffective. This paper
demonstrates how a Local Area Network (LAN) can be covertly exposed to the
Internet via an insider attack. Specifically, it illustrates how an external
machine can gain access to a LAN by exploiting an unused secondary IP address
of the attacked LAN, effectively bypassing existing security mechanisms by also
exploiting Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Despite the presence of robust
external protections, such as firewalls and IDS, this form of insider attack
reveals significant vulnerabilities in the way internal threats are addressed.

Motivation: 解决代码生成模型在生成安全代码和防御恶意网络活动方面的不足。

Method: 两阶段训练：规则学习（明确引用网络安全规则）和强化学习（多目标奖励机制优化安全性）。

Result: 开发的PurpCode-32B模型在网络安全方面表现最优，同时减少过度拒绝率并保持实用性。

Conclusion: PurpCode有效提升了代码推理模型的安全性和实用性。

Abstract: We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code
reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious
cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule
Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to
generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious
cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety
and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms.
To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we
conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage
prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the
model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely
PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming
various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model
overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while
preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的预测器，用于自动化选择最适合执行特定量子电路的量子硬件平台，显著提高了选择效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子硬件技术的多样性导致选择最佳执行平台时面临挑战，传统方法计算成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 利用GNN分析量子电路的有向无环图（DAG）表示，避免手动提取特征，直接嵌入图结构进行预测。

Result: 在498个量子电路的测试中，模型准确率达到94.4%，对少数类别的F1分数为85.5%。

Conclusion: GNN方法显著加速了最优硬件选择过程，并保持了信息的完整性，代码已开源。

Abstract: The growing variety of quantum hardware technologies, each with unique
peculiarities such as connectivity and native gate sets, creates challenges
when selecting the best platform for executing a specific quantum circuit. This
selection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the
circuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as
circuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally
expensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors
increases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based
predictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498
quantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using
Qiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv,
IBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte).
Performance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate
fidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on
the trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting
platforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids
extracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it
as a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making
process and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4%
accuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting
the best compilation target. The developed code is publicly available on GitHub
(https://github.com/antotu/GNN-Model-Quantum-Predictor).

Abstract: Share market is one of the most important sectors of economic development of
a country. Everyday almost all companies issue their shares and investors buy
and sell shares of these companies. Generally investors want to buy shares of
the companies whose market liquidity is comparatively greater. Market liquidity
depends on the average price of a share. In this paper, a thorough linear
regression analysis has been performed on the stock market data of Dhaka Stock
Exchange. Later, the linear model has been compared with random forest based on
different metrics showing better results for random forest model. However, the
amount of individual significance of different factors on the variability of
stock price has been identified and explained. This paper also shows that the
time series data is not capable of generating a predictive linear model for

Motivation: 探索搜索问题的向下自归约性，特别是在更复杂的搜索问题中，以扩展Harsha等人的研究。

Method: 通过随机化向下自归约和访问特定预言机的方法，分析问题的复杂性。

Result: 证明了任何在TFΣiP中且具有向下自归约性的问题必须在PLSΣi−1P中，若解唯一则在UEOPLΣi−1P中。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了向下自归约性在搜索问题中的普遍现象，并提供了新的复杂性上界。

Abstract: A problem $\mathcal{P}$ is considered downward self-reducible, if there
exists an efficient algorithm for $\mathcal{P}$ that is allowed to make queries
to only strictly smaller instances of $\mathcal{P}$. Downward self-reducibility
has been well studied in the case of decision problems, and it is well known
that any downward self-reducible problem must lie in $\mathsf{PSPACE}$. Harsha,
Mitropolsky and Rosen [ITCS, 2023] initiated the study of downward self
reductions in the case of search problems. They showed the following
interesting collapse: if a problem is in $\mathsf{TFNP}$ and also downward
self-reducible, then it must be in $\mathsf{PLS}$. Moreover, if the problem
admits a unique solution then it must be in $\mathsf{UEOPL}$.
  We demonstrate that this represents just the tip of a much more general
phenomenon, which holds for even harder search problems that lie higher up in
the total function polynomial hierarchy ($\mathsf{TF\Sigma_i^P}$). In fact,
even if we allow our downward self-reduction to be much more powerful, such a
collapse will still occur.
  We show that any problem in $\mathsf{TF\Sigma_i^P}$ which admits a randomized
downward self-reduction with access to a $\mathsf{\Sigma_{i-1}^P}$ oracle must
be in $\mathsf{PLS}^{\mathsf{\Sigma_{i-1}^P}}$. If the problem has
\textit{essentially unique solutions} then it lies in
$\mathsf{UEOPL}^{\mathsf{\Sigma_{i-1}^P}}$.
  As one (out of many) application of our framework, we get new upper bounds
for the problems $\mathrm{Range Avoidance}$ and $\mathrm{Linear Ordering
Principle}$ and show that they are both in $\mathsf{UEOPL}^{\mathsf{NP}}$.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的单次联邦学习框架（OSFL），通过特征引导修正流模型（FG-RF）和双层知识蒸馏（DLKD）方法，解决了医疗领域中的训练效率低、隐私泄露和非独立同分布（non-IID）数据问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于生成模型的OSFL方法在医疗领域存在训练效率低、隐私泄露风险高，且在non-IID数据下单轮收敛困难。

Method: 提出FG-RF模型加速生成建模并保护隐私，采用DLKD方法在聚合时对齐中间层特征和输出逻辑。

Result: 在三个non-IID医疗影像数据集上，新框架性能优于多轮联邦学习方法，提升达21.73%，且隐私泄露风险显著降低。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了OSFL在医疗领域的问题，提升了性能和隐私保护能力。

Abstract: In multi-center scenarios, One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has attracted
increasing attention due to its low communication overhead, requiring only a
single round of transmission. However, existing generative model-based OSFL
methods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in
the healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single
round of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically
Distributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a
modified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified
Flow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation
method are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling
in medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing
feature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID
distributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic
the output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side
teacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID
medical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform
multi-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,
and exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly
reduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images.

Motivation: 现有车道检测模型在封闭环境下评估，跨数据集分布偏移会导致灾难性遗忘，需要一种参数高效的适应方法。

Method: 首先在源分布上训练基础模型，然后通过分支结构对目标分布进行选择性微调，同时保持源分支固定。使用监督对比学习模型动态路由输入。

Result: 框架在显著减少参数量的同时，实现了接近最优的F1分数。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了跨数据集分布偏移问题，同时实现了参数高效的模型适应。

Abstract: Lane detection models are often evaluated in a closed-world setting, where
training and testing occur on the same dataset. We observe that, even within
the same domain, cross-dataset distribution shifts can cause severe
catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. To address this, we first train a
base model on a source distribution and then adapt it to each new target
distribution by creating separate branches, fine-tuning only selected
components while keeping the original source branch fixed. Based on a
component-wise analysis, we identify effective fine-tuning strategies for
target distributions that enable parameter-efficient adaptation. At inference
time, we propose using a supervised contrastive learning model to identify the
input distribution and dynamically route it to the corresponding branch. Our
framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while using significantly fewer
parameters than training separate models for each distribution.

Motivation: 人类动作识别在医疗领域有重要应用，但传统模型难以泛化复杂动作。CLIP模型在视频数据中展现出潜力，但其性能需进一步验证和改进。

Method: 在UCF-101数据集上评估CLIP模型，采用三种掩码策略（百分比/形状掩码、特征特定掩码和隔离掩码），并提出通过类特定噪声增强模型性能。

Result: CLIP在视觉线索被遮挡时表现不一致且易误分类。改进方法提高了分类准确性和模型信心，同时减少了偏差。

Conclusion: 论文讨论了CLIP模型在临床领域的挑战，并提出了未来改进方向，以提高跨领域医疗场景的泛化能力。

Abstract: Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine,
supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection,
surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional
models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle
to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer
promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In
this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze
its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and
shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to
suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only
class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent
behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual
cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating
class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce
attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification
accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a
discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and
outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across
domain-independent healthcare scenarios.

Conclusion: 注意力机制对性能提升至关重要，为视觉语言任务提供了可复现的设计蓝图。

Abstract: Image captioning, a task at the confluence of computer vision and natural
language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual
scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by
large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic,
iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from
a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. We
present a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with
Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic
attention mechanism. Our experiments chart the impact of architectural
enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM
paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding
attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck
cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the
architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, our
final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several
foundational benchmarks and validating our iterative design process. This work
provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural
principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: RealDeal模型显著提升了生成脑部MRI图像的细节和真实感。

Abstract: We propose image-to-image diffusion models that are designed to enhance the
realism and details of generated brain images by introducing sharp edges, fine
textures, subtle anatomical features, and imaging noise. Generative models have
been widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation
applications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in
generating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images
from these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and
scan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work
formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image
diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ
commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment.
Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images
generated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and
texture.

Abstract: Underwater pollution is one of today's most significant environmental
concerns, with vast volumes of garbage found in seas, rivers, and landscapes
around the world. Accurate detection of these waste materials is crucial for
successful waste management, environmental monitoring, and mitigation
strategies. In this study, we investigated the performance of five cutting-edge
object recognition algorithms, namely YOLO (You Only Look Once) models,
including YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and Faster Region-Convolutional
Neural Network (R-CNN), to identify which model was most effective at
recognizing materials in underwater situations. The models were thoroughly
trained and tested on a large dataset containing fifteen different classes
under diverse conditions, such as low visibility and variable depths. From the
above-mentioned models, YOLOv8 outperformed the others, with a mean Average
Precision (mAP) of 80.9%, indicating a significant performance. This increased
performance is attributed to YOLOv8's architecture, which incorporates advanced
features such as improved anchor-free mechanisms and self-supervised learning,
allowing for more precise and efficient recognition of items in a variety of
settings. These findings highlight the YOLOv8 model's potential as an effective
tool in the global fight against pollution, improving both the detection

Abstract: Mixed modality search -- retrieving information across a heterogeneous corpus
composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet
underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how
contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality
search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a
pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings
form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal
fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight
post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding
space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for
mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points
over CLIP, surpasses recent vision-language generative embedding models by 4
percentage points, while using 75x less compute.

Result: SIDE在保持准确性的同时，将解释规模减少90%以上。

Conclusion: SIDE显著提升了原型解释的可理解性，适用于大规模数据集。

Abstract: Understanding the decisions made by deep neural networks is essential in
high-stakes domains such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Yet, these
models often lack transparency, particularly in computer vision.
Prototypical-parts-based neural networks have emerged as a promising solution
by offering concept-level explanations. However, most are limited to
fine-grained classification tasks, with few exceptions such as InfoDisent.
InfoDisent extends prototypical models to large-scale datasets like ImageNet,
but produces complex explanations.
  We introduce Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE), a
novel method that improves the interpretability of prototypical parts through a
dedicated training and pruning scheme that enforces sparsity. Combined with
sigmoid activations in place of softmax, this approach allows SIDE to associate
each class with only a small set of relevant prototypes. Extensive experiments
show that SIDE matches the accuracy of existing methods while reducing
explanation size by over $90\%$, substantially enhancing the understandability
of prototype-based explanations.

Method: 采用两阶段减少管道：选择性传输（ST）和自适应网格减少（AGR），结合软门控Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）注意力层进行特征融合。

Result: 在OPV2V基准测试中，EffiComm达到0.84 mAP@0.7，每帧仅传输约1.5 MB数据，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EffiComm展示了自适应学习通信在可扩展V2X感知中的价值。

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected vehicles to exchange sensor
information and overcome each vehicle's blind spots. Yet transmitting raw point
clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications,
causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end
framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while
maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage
reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions
with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and
network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and
specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark,
EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately
1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve.
These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for
scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.

TL;DR: LOTUS是一个用于评估详细图像描述的排行榜，填补了现有评估在标准化、偏见意识和用户偏好方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法缺乏标准化标准、忽视偏见和用户偏好，LOTUS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: LOTUS通过多维度评估（如描述质量、风险和偏见）并结合用户偏好，分析大型视觉语言模型的表现。

Result: 研究发现没有模型在所有标准上表现优异，且描述详细性与偏见风险相关，最优模型选择取决于用户需求。

Conclusion: LOTUS为详细图像描述评估提供了全面框架，强调了用户偏好在模型选择中的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have transformed image captioning,
shifting from concise captions to detailed descriptions. We introduce LOTUS, a
leaderboard for evaluating detailed captions, addressing three main gaps in
existing evaluations: lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments,
and user preference considerations. LOTUS comprehensively evaluates various
aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks
(\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling
preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user
preferences. Our analysis of recent LVLMs reveals no single model excels across
all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks.
Preference-oriented evaluations demonstrate that optimal model selection
depends on user priorities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于电路的框架，研究大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中时空视觉语义的表征和处理机制，发现视觉语义高度集中于特定对象标记，且中层到深层网络对时空语义具有专门功能定位。


<details>

Motivation: 目前对LVLMs中时空理解的内在推理机制研究不足，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了一个包含视觉审计电路、语义追踪电路和注意力流电路的系统框架，分析LVLMs中时空语义的处理。

Result: 发现视觉语义集中在特定对象标记，移除这些标记会导致模型性能下降高达92.6%；中层到深层网络表现出对时空语义的专门功能定位。

Conclusion: 研究为LVLMs的时空语义分析提供了机制性见解，为设计更鲁棒和可解释的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However,
the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding
remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic,
circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual
semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our
framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing
circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we
discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object
tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.
Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions
emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.
In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we
reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional
localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant
mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a
foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于CNN的3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）初始化方法，解决了传统方法需要精确姿态和高计算成本的问题，适用于空间应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的新视角合成技术（如NeRF和3DGS）需要精确的姿态信息且计算成本高，限制了其在空间应用中的使用。

Method: 1. 使用CNN从单目图像初始化3DGS的粗略模型；2. 支持噪声或隐式姿态估计的训练流程；3. 分析了不同初始化变体以减少训练成本。

Result: 方法显著减少了训练迭代次数和输入图像需求（至少一个数量级），并在不完美姿态监督下仍能学习高保真3D表示。

Conclusion: 该工作为空间应用中的新视角合成技术提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has enabled learning precise 3D models only from posed
monocular images. Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major
limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses
during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To
address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)
a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)
and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of
precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D
model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose
relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize
3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images
needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the
CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.
This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their
effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose
estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,
the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the
door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.

*Maria Zaitseva,Ivan Tomilov,Natalia Gusarova*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过修改反向传播（视为多智能体博弈）和探索目标变量加噪的方法，提升前馈神经网络（FFNN）对输入噪声的鲁棒性。实验表明，梯度丢弃（p=0.9）结合稳定分布目标加噪在回归任务中显著提高了鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前馈神经网络（FFNN）易受输入噪声影响，现有正则化方法（如dropout）常改变网络结构或忽略神经元交互。

Method: 提出“梯度丢弃”，在反向传播中按概率1-p选择性隐藏层梯度置零，同时保持前向传播活跃；并结合目标变量的白噪声或稳定分布扰动。

Result: 在10个多样化表格数据集上实验，结果因数据集和超参数而异。回归任务中，梯度丢弃（p=0.9）与稳定分布目标加噪显著提升了输入噪声鲁棒性（MSE曲线更平缓，SMAPE更稳定）。

Conclusion: 该方法潜力显著，强调了自适应参数调优的重要性，并为在博弈论框架下分析神经网络作为复杂自适应系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) are vulnerable to input noise, reducing
prediction performance. Existing regularization methods like dropout often
alter network architecture or overlook neuron interactions. This study aims to
enhance FFNN noise robustness by modifying backpropagation, interpreted as a
multi-agent game, and exploring controlled target variable noising. Our
"gradient dropout" selectively nullifies hidden layer neuron gradients with
probability 1 - p during backpropagation, while keeping forward passes active.
This is framed within compositional game theory. Additionally, target variables
were perturbed with white noise or stable distributions. Experiments on ten
diverse tabular datasets show varying impacts: improvement or diminishing of
robustness and accuracy, depending on dataset and hyperparameters. Notably, on
regression tasks, gradient dropout (p = 0.9) combined with stable distribution
target noising significantly increased input noise robustness, evidenced by
flatter MSE curves and more stable SMAPE values. These results highlight the
method's potential, underscore the critical role of adaptive parameter tuning,
and open new avenues for analyzing neural networks as complex adaptive systems
exhibiting emergent behavior within a game-theoretic framework.

TL;DR: TiVy算法通过动态时间规整（DTW）和频繁序列模式，解决了多时间序列可视化中的可扩展性和视觉清晰度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长时间跨度下难以避免视觉混乱，TiVy旨在提供更清晰的可视化总结。

Method: 将时间序列转换为基于视觉相似性的符号序列，并通过频繁序列模式构建不重叠的分组。

Result: TiVy能提取清晰模式，速度提升1000倍，并支持实时可视化大规模数据。

Conclusion: TiVy在时间序列可视化中表现出高效性和准确性，适用于探索隐藏结构。

Abstract: Visualizing multiple time series presents fundamental tradeoffs between
scalability and visual clarity. Time series capture the behavior of many
large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities.
Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or
superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and
patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when
covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small
multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that
summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into
a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar
subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a
visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer
small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar
subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an
interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in
real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts
clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a
significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We
also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in
massive time series data in two usage scenarios.

Motivation: 服务组合在构建自适应智能系统中面临语义推理和执行机制的挑战，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出集成LRMs（擅长语义推理）和LAMs（擅长动态执行）的架构框架。

Result: 该框架能够自动化服务组合，通过自然语言意图驱动，弥合意图与执行之间的鸿沟。

Conclusion: LRM-LAM集成框架有望实现完全自动化、用户友好的服务组合过程。

Abstract: Service composition remains a central challenge in building adaptive and
intelligent software systems, often constrained by limited reasoning
capabilities or brittle execution mechanisms. This paper explores the
integration of two emerging paradigms enabled by large language models: Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs). We argue that LRMs
address the challenges of semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity while
LAMs excel in dynamic action execution and system interoperability. However,
each paradigm has complementary limitations - LRMs lack grounded action
capabilities, and LAMs often struggle with deep reasoning. We propose an
integrated LRM-LAM architectural framework as a promising direction for
advancing automated service composition. Such a system can reason about service
requirements and constraints while dynamically executing workflows, thus
bridging the gap between intention and execution. This integration has the
potential to transform service composition into a fully automated,
user-friendly process driven by high-level natural language intent.

Motivation: 解决AI模型在资源受限环境中因体积大、计算需求高而难以部署的问题。

Method: 采用知识嫁接机制，将大模型（供体）的部分特征（接穗）转移到小模型（砧木）上。

Result: 模型体积减少88.54%，验证准确率提升至89.97%，测试准确率达90.45%。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了模型体积与性能的权衡，适用于边缘计算场景，推动AI在资源受限环境中的应用。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to larger,
more complex models with numerous parameters that require substantial computing
power -- resources often unavailable in many real-world application scenarios.
Our paper addresses this challenge by introducing knowledge grafting, a novel
mechanism that optimizes AI models for resource-constrained environments by
transferring selected features (the scion) from a large donor model to a
smaller rootstock model. The approach achieves an 88.54% reduction in model
size (from 64.39 MB to 7.38 MB), while improving generalization capability of
the model. Our new rootstock model achieves 89.97% validation accuracy (vs.
donor's 87.47%), maintains lower validation loss (0.2976 vs. 0.5068), and
performs exceptionally well on unseen test data with 90.45% accuracy. It
addresses the typical size vs performance trade-off, and enables deployment of
AI frameworks on resource-constrained devices with enhanced performance. We
have tested our approach on an agricultural weed detection scenario, however,
it can be extended across various edge computing scenarios, potentially
accelerating AI adoption in areas with limited hardware/software support -- by
mirroring in a similar manner the horticultural grafting enables productive
cultivation in challenging agri-based environments.

Result: 在数学公式简化等任务中表现优异，显著优于Neural Data Router和GPT-4o等基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的系统在泛化、效率和性能上均表现出色，适用于多领域学习。

Abstract: Building neural systems that can learn to execute symbolic algorithms is a
challenging open problem in artificial intelligence, especially when aiming for
strong generalization and out-of-distribution performance. In this work, we
introduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems
using a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself.
We present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural
Rewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a
result of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both
models can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering
significant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and
inference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the
simplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their
versatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is
trained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system
significantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router,
a recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic
problems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language
models. Moreover, our system matches or outperforms the latest o1-preview model
from OpenAI that excels in reasoning benchmarks.

Result: 在10、15和20个污水管网案例中，该方法比传统深度Q学习和遗传算法收敛更快、扩展性更好，且能提供接近最优的解决方案。

Conclusion: 分层方法有效解决了大规模基础设施规划中的复杂性和可扩展性问题，为实际应用提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Budget planning and maintenance optimization are crucial for infrastructure
asset management, ensuring cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the
complexity arising from combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset
deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty
significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a
Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to
multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into
two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets
within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner
prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating
macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear
programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the
method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures
rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying
sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic
algorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and
consistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows.

Motivation: 传统拼接合成方法存在不连续性问题，且需要大量训练数据。本文旨在通过潜在向量颗粒化技术解决这些问题，同时支持多样化的音频材料。

Method: 通过将源音频编码为潜在向量段创建“颗粒码本”，然后将目标音频的潜在颗粒与码本中最接近的匹配项结合，解码生成新音频。

Result: 生成的音频保留了目标音频的时序结构，同时融合了源音频的音色特征，避免了传统方法的不连续性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练，适用于多样化音频材料，提供了一种高效且灵活的音频再合成解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel technique for creative audio resynthesis that operates
by reworking the concept of granular synthesis at the latent vector level. Our
approach creates a "granular codebook" by encoding a source audio corpus into
latent vector segments, then matches each latent grain of a target audio signal
to its closest counterpart in the codebook. The resulting hybrid sequence is
decoded to produce audio that preserves the target's temporal structure while
adopting the source's timbral characteristics. This technique requires no model
training, works with diverse audio materials, and naturally avoids the
discontinuities typical of traditional concatenative synthesis through the
codec's implicit interpolation during decoding. We include supplementary
material at https://github.com/naotokui/latentgranular/ , as well as a
proof-of-concept implementation to allow users to experiment with their own
sounds at https://huggingface.co/spaces/naotokui/latentgranular .

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法（如GRPO）需要大量尝试来学习新任务，而语言的解释性可能为LLMs提供更丰富的学习媒介。

Method: GEPA通过自然语言反思诊断问题、提出并测试提示更新，并结合Pareto前沿的互补经验，优化LLM提示。

Result: GEPA在四个任务中平均比GRPO性能提升10%，最高达20%，且尝试次数减少35倍；同时优于MIPROv2 10%以上。

Conclusion: GEPA展示了通过自然语言反思高效优化提示的潜力，尤其在代码优化等任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via
reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue
that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer
learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse,
scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt
optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn
high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or
more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool
calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose
problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons
from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it
can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four
tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up
to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer,
MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an
inference-time search strategy for code optimization.

an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism. Our approach departs from
prior unsupervised or monolingual pipelines by leveraging explicit toxic word

TL;DR: CueBuddy通过实时技术关键词识别和多语言词汇表查询，帮助非英语母语的STEM学生理解复杂英语术语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球南方STEM学生因英语技术术语困难而落后的问题。

Method: 开发CueBuddy系统，提供实时“词汇提示”和技术关键词识别。

Result: 帮助学生跟上复杂英语术语，不干扰课堂注意力。

Conclusion: CueBuddy是一种有效但仍有局限的解决方案，未来可扩展。

Abstract: Students across the world in STEM classes, especially in the Global South,
fall behind their peers who are more fluent in English, despite being at par
with them in terms of scientific prerequisites. While many of them are able to
follow everyday English at ease, key terms in English stay challenging. In most
cases, such students have had most of their course prerequisites in a lower
resource language. Live speech translation to lower resource languages is a
promising area of research, however, models for speech translation can be too
expensive on a large scale and often struggle with technical content. In this
paper, we describe CueBuddy, which aims to remediate these issues by providing
real-time "lexical cues" through technical keyword spotting along real-time
multilingual glossary lookup to help students stay up to speed with complex
English jargon without disrupting their concentration on the lecture. We also
describe the limitations and future extensions of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG在处理半相关干扰段落或需要深度推理的问题时表现不佳，PrismRAG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PrismRAG通过训练模型处理干扰性QA对（混合黄金证据与干扰段落），并培养模型自主规划、推理和综合的习惯。

Result: 在12个开放书RAG QA基准测试中，PrismRAG平均事实准确性提升了5.4%，优于现有最佳方案。

Conclusion: PrismRAG通过高效微调和推理习惯培养，显著提升了RAG的性能，尤其在复杂推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often falls short when retrieved context
includes confusing semi-relevant passages, or when answering questions require
deep contextual understanding and reasoning. We propose an efficient
fine-tuning framework, called PrismRAG, that (i) trains the model with
distractor-aware QA pairs mixing gold evidence with subtle distractor passages,
and (ii) instills reasoning-centric habits that make the LLM plan, rationalize,
and synthesize without relying on extensive human engineered instructions.
Evaluated across 12 open-book RAG QA benchmarks spanning diverse application
domains and scenarios, PrismRAG improves average factuality by 5.4%,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a major advancement in
natural language processing (NLP), combining large language models (LLMs) with
information retrieval systems to enhance factual grounding, accuracy, and
contextual relevance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of
RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question
answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse
applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG,
particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in
parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms,
sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in
detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends,
providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the
deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges
related to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A
comparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking
performance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and
computational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality,
privacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally,
the review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval
approaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and
agentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more
reliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems.

*Bohan Yao,Vikas Yadav*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-TAG框架通过多工具聚合增强LLM的数学推理能力，显著提升复杂问题的解决效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强方法在复杂数学推理中表现不足，需改进多步骤精确推理能力。

Method: Multi-TAG框架允许LLM在每一步并发调用多个工具，并聚合输出以验证和优化推理过程。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，Multi-TAG平均提升6.0%至7.5%的性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Multi-TAG无需微调，适用于各类LLM，显著提升复杂数学问题的解决能力。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising
avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior
tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a
single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math
reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with
more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps.
To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool
AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG
guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It
then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning
process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a
finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any
LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally
expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned
with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks:
MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and
closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0%
to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Chaymaa Abbas,Mariette Awad,Razane Tajeddine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使少量数据污染也会显著增加LLMs对非洲裔美国英语（AAVE）输入的毒性输出，而对标准美国英语（SAE）影响较小。模型规模越大，放大效应越明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨方言差异（AAVE与SAE）与数据污染如何共同影响LLMs输出的毒性，揭示社会偏见在模型中的放大机制。

Method: 使用不同规模的LLaMA模型，结合数据污染实验，并通过GPT-4o作为公平性审计工具分析输出中的有害模式。

Result: AAVE输入的毒性显著增加，且大型模型放大效应更强；GPT-4o发现AAVE输入更易关联有害刻板印象。

Conclusion: 需开发方言感知的评估方法、针对性去偏干预措施及社会责任训练协议，以减少方言偏见与数据污染的叠加影响。

Abstract: Despite the ongoing improvements in the design of large language models
(LLMs) to foster inclusion and balanced responses, these systems remain
susceptible to encoding and amplifying social biases. This study examines how
dialectal variation, specifically African American Vernacular English (AAVE)
versus Standard American English (SAE), interacts with data poisoning to
influence toxicity in outputs. Using both small- and medium-scale LLaMA models,
we show that even minimal exposure to poisoned data significantly increases
toxicity for AAVE inputs, while it remains comparatively unaffected for SAE.
Larger models exhibit a more significant amplification effect which suggests
heightened susceptibility with scale. To further assess these disparities, we
employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical
patterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of
aggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority. These findings
underscore the compounding impact of data poisoning and dialectal bias and
emphasize the need for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing
interventions, and socially responsible training protocols during development.
