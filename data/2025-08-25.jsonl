Given queries and certain index-related\nconstraints, traditional methods rely on heuristic optimization or\nlearning-based models to select effective indexes and improve query\nperformance. However, heuristic optimization suffers from high computation\ntime, and learning-based models lose generalisability due to training for\ndifferent workloads and database schemas. With the recent rapid development of\nlarge language models (LLMs), methods using prompt tuning have been proposed to\nenhance the efficiency of index selection. However, such methods still can not\nachieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, and preparing the index selection\ndemonstrations is also resource-intensive. To address these issues, we propose\nMAAdvisor, a zero-shot LLM-based index advisor with a multi-agent framework. We\ndecompose the index recommendation problem into sub-steps, including planning,\nselection, combination, revision, and reflection. A set of LLM-embedded agents\nis designed to handle each one of the different sub-steps.

In this trend towards\nnext-generation smart and integrated energy-communication-transportation (ECT)\ninfrastructure, base stations are believed to play a key role as service hubs.\nBy exploring the overlap between base station distribution and electric vehicle\ncharging infrastructure, we demonstrate the feasibility of efficiently charging\nEVs using base station batteries and renewable power plants at the Hub. Our\nmodel considers various factors, including base station traffic conditions,\nweather, and EV charging behavior. This paper introduces an incentive mechanism\nfor setting charging prices and employs a deep reinforcement learning-based\nmethod for battery scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed ECT-Hub in optimizing surplus energy utilization\nand reducing operating costs, particularly through revenue-generating EV\ncharging."}

A stack (resp. queue) layout places vertices\nalong a line and assigns edges to pages so that no two edges on the same page\nare crossing (resp. nested). We provide three new algorithms which together\nsubstantially expand our understanding of these problems:\n  (1) A fixed-parameter algorithm for computing minimum-page stack and queue\nlayouts w.r.t. the vertex integrity of an n-vertex graph G. This result is\nmotivated by an open question in the literature and generalizes the previous\nalgorithms parameterizing by the vertex cover number of G. The proof relies on\na newly developed Ramsey pruning technique. Vertex integrity intuitively\nmeasures the vertex deletion distance to a subgraph with only small connected\ncomponents.\n  (2) An n^(O(q * l)) algorithm for computing l-page stack and queue layouts of\npage width at most q. This is the first algorithm avoiding a double-exponential\ndependency on the parameters. The page width of a layout measures the maximum\nnumber of edges one needs to cross on any page to reach the outer face.\n  (3) A 2^(O(n)) algorithm for computing 1-page queue layouts.

Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) smart\ngovernance is the most investigated and modeled smart city dimension; (ii) the\nmost used modeling approaches are business, architectural, and ontological\nmodeling approaches, spanning multiple application fields; (iii) the great\nmajority of existing technologies for modeling smart cities are not yet proven\nin operational environments; (iv) diverse research communities publish their\nresults in a multitude of different venues which further motivates the\npresented literature study. Researchers can use our results for better\nunderstanding the state-of-the-art in modeling smart cities, and as a\nfoundation for further analysis of specific approaches about smart cities\nmodeling. Lastly, we also discuss the impact of our analysis for the\nModel-Driven Engineering community."}

We found that code coverage cannot accurately measure the\nextent to which code is validated and mutation testing is computationally\nexpensive for evaluating metamorphic testing methods. In this work, we propose\nMetamorphic Coverage (MC), a coverage metric that examines the distinct code\nexecuted by pairs of test inputs within metamorphic testing. Our intuition is\nthat, typically, a bug can be observed if the corresponding code is executed\nwhen executing either test input but not the other one, so covering more\ndifferential code covered by pairs of test inputs might be more likely to\nexpose bugs. While most metamorphic testing methods have been based on this\ngeneral intuition, our work defines and systematically evaluates MC on five\nwidely used metamorphic testing methods for testing database engines,\ncompilers, and constraint solvers. The code measured by MC overlaps with the\nbug-fix locations of 50 of 64 bugs found by metamorphic testing methods, and MC\nhas a stronger positive correlation with bug numbers than line coverage. MC is\n4x more sensitive than line coverage in distinguishing testing methods'\neffectiveness, and the average value of MC is 6x smaller than line coverage\nwhile still capturing the part of the program that is being tested.

To address these limitations, post-training pruning has\nemerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency\nwithout the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing\npruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require\ncomputationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a\nnovel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained\nLLMs without any retraining.

Method: We conducted experiments on the QuixBugs\nbenchmark to compare the bug-fixing accuracy of SLMs and LLMs. We also analyzed\nthe impact of int8 quantization on APR performance. Results: The latest SLMs\ncan fix bugs as accurately as--or even more accurately than--LLMs. Also, int8\nquantization had minimal effect on APR accuracy while significantly reducing\nmemory requirements. Conclusions: SLMs present a viable alternative to LLMs for\nAPR, offering competitive accuracy with lower computational costs, and\nquantization can further enhance their efficiency without compromising\neffectiveness."}

To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate\nthat collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its\nunderlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low\nnoise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting\nin high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers,\nultimately causes collapse errors.

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed.

Second, a ridge penalty\nterm is used to shrink the coefficients on the features in the enlarged feature\nspace. Third, the solution is not obtained in this enlarged feature space, but\nthrough solving a dual problem in the observation space. A major drawback in\nthe present use of kernels is that the interpretation in terms of the original\nfeatures is lost. In this paper, we argue that in the case of a wide matrix of\nfeatures, where there are more features than observations, the kernel solution\ncan be re-expressed in terms of a linear combination of the original matrix of\nfeatures and a ridge penalty that involves a special metric.
