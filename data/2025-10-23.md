### [1] [FlexiDataGen: An Adaptive LLM Framework for Dynamic Semantic Dataset Generation in Sensitive Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19025)
*Hamed Jelodar,Samita Bai,Roozbeh Razavi-Far,Ali A. Ghorbani*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: FlexiDataGen是一个基于大语言模型的自适应框架，用于在敏感领域生成动态语义数据集，解决数据稀缺、获取成本高和隐私限制等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在医疗、生物医学和网络安全等领域面临数据稀缺、获取成本高、标注数据有限以及关键事件罕见或敏感等挑战，这些数据集问题阻碍了准确且可泛化模型的发展。

Method: FlexiDataGen框架包含四个核心组件：(1)句法-语义分析，(2)检索增强生成，(3)动态元素注入，(4)带语义验证的迭代复述，确保生成高质量、领域相关的数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，FlexiDataGen有效缓解了数据短缺和标注瓶颈，支持可扩展且准确的机器学习模型开发。

Conclusion: FlexiDataGen为解决敏感领域的数据集挑战提供了一种有效方法，通过动态语义数据集生成促进机器学习模型的发展。

Abstract: Dataset availability and quality remain critical challenges in machine
learning, especially in domains where data are scarce, expensive to acquire, or
constrained by privacy regulations. Fields such as healthcare, biomedical
research, and cybersecurity frequently encounter high data acquisition costs,
limited access to annotated data, and the rarity or sensitivity of key events.
These issues-collectively referred to as the dataset challenge-hinder the
development of accurate and generalizable machine learning models in such
high-stakes domains. To address this, we introduce FlexiDataGen, an adaptive
large language model (LLM) framework designed for dynamic semantic dataset
generation in sensitive domains. FlexiDataGen autonomously synthesizes rich,
semantically coherent, and linguistically diverse datasets tailored to
specialized fields. The framework integrates four core components: (1)
syntactic-semantic analysis, (2) retrieval-augmented generation, (3) dynamic
element injection, and (4) iterative paraphrasing with semantic validation.
Together, these components ensure the generation of high-quality,
domain-relevant data. Experimental results show that FlexiDataGen effectively
alleviates data shortages and annotation bottlenecks, enabling scalable and
accurate machine learning model development.

### [2] [Fine-Grained Dichotomies for Conjunctive Queries with Minimum or Maximum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19197)
*Nofar Carmeli,Nikolaos Tziavelis*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在最小/最大值排序下直接访问连接查询答案的细粒度复杂性，并探索了相关任务，包括排序枚举、计数、枚举、直接访问和谓词消除等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究连接查询在最小/最大值排序下的直接访问复杂性，以及相关任务的效率边界，旨在建立完整的复杂性分类。

Method: 使用细粒度复杂性分析工具，针对无自连接的连接查询，分析各种任务在最小/最大值排序下的时间效率。

Result: 为无自连接连接查询建立了完整的二分法，精确识别了哪些情况可以在近理想时间内解决（准线性预处理时间，常数或对数时间输出）。

Conclusion: 论文为连接查询在最小/最大值排序下的各种任务提供了完整的复杂性分类，确定了可高效处理的查询类别。

Abstract: We investigate the fine-grained complexity of direct access to Conjunctive
Query (CQ) answers according to their position, ordered by the minimum (or
maximum) value between attributes. We further use the tools we develop to
explore a wealth of related tasks. We consider the task of ranked enumeration
under min/max orders, as well as tasks concerning CQs with predicates of the
form x <= min X , where X is a set of variables and x is a single variable:
counting, enumeration, direct access, and predicate elimination (i.e.,
transforming the pair of query and database to an equivalent pair without
min-predicates). For each task, we establish a complete dichotomy for
self-join-free CQs, precisely identifying the cases that are solvable in
near-ideal time, i.e., (quasi)linear preprocessing time followed by constant or
logarithmic time per output.

### [3] [AI for Distributed Systems Design: Scalable Cloud Optimization Through Repeated LLMs Sampling And Simulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18897)
*Jacopo Tagliabue*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 结合大型语言模型的随机代码生成与领域特定模拟器中的确定性验证，探索AI驱动的分布式系统策略设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过AI辅助设计分布式系统策略，在保持可解释性的同时探索大规模设计空间。

Method: 使用生成-验证循环：LLM生成Python策略，模拟器在标准化轨迹上评估，结构化反馈指导后续生成。

Result: 在多模型上实现了吞吐量改进的初步结果。

Conclusion: AI对于扩展该方法论至关重要，特别是帮助引导新模拟器的开发。

Abstract: We explore AI-driven distributed-systems policy design by combining
stochastic code generation from large language models (LLMs) with deterministic
verification in a domain-specific simulator. Using a Function-as-a-Service
runtime (Bauplan) and its open-source simulator (Eudoxia) as a case study, we
frame scheduler design as an iterative generate-and-verify loop: an LLM
proposes a Python policy, the simulator evaluates it on standardized traces,
and structured feedback steers subsequent generations. This setup preserves
interpretability while enabling targeted search over a large design space. We
detail the system architecture and report preliminary results on throughput
improvements across multiple models. Beyond early gains, we discuss the limits
of the current setup and outline next steps; in particular, we conjecture that
AI will be crucial for scaling this methodology by helping to bootstrap new
simulators.

### [4] [CodeCRDT: Observation-Driven Coordination for Multi-Agent LLM Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18893)
*Sergey Pugachev*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CodeCRDT使用CRDT技术实现无锁、无冲突的并行代码生成，通过观察驱动协调替代显式消息传递，在部分任务上实现21.1%加速，但某些任务有39.4%减速，100%收敛且无合并失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体LLM系统由于昂贵的协调成本无法实现并行加速，需要更高效的协调机制。

Method: 采用冲突无关复制数据类型(CRDTs)，通过监控共享状态的可观察更新和确定性收敛来实现观察驱动协调，而非显式消息传递。

Result: 在600次试验中，部分任务加速21.1%，部分任务减速39.4%，100%收敛且无合并失败，语义冲突率5-10%。

Conclusion: 研究形式化了随机LLM智能体的观察驱动协调，揭示了语义冲突率和质量-性能权衡，并基于任务结构提供了并行协调成功与失败的实证特征。

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM systems fail to realize parallel speedups due to costly
coordination. We present CodeCRDT, an observation-driven coordination pattern
where agents coordinate by monitoring a shared state with observable updates
and deterministic convergence, rather than explicit message passing. Using
Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), CodeCRDT enables lock-free,
conflict-free concurrent code generation with strong eventual consistency.
Evaluation across 600 trials (6 tasks, 50 runs per mode) shows both benefits
and trade-offs: up to 21.1% speedup on some tasks, up to 39.4% slowdown on
others, and 100% convergence with zero merge failures. The study formalizes
observation-driven coordination for stochastic LLM agents, revealing semantic
conflict rates (5-10%) and quality-performance tradeoffs, and provides
empirical characterization of when parallel coordination succeeds versus fails
based on task structure.

### [5] [Comparative analysis of large data processing in Apache Spark using Java, Python and Scala](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19012)
*Ivan Borodii,Illia Fedorovych,Halyna Osukhivska,Diana Velychko,Roman Butsii*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 比较了使用Apache Spark平台在Java、Python和Scala编程语言中处理大数据的性能差异，发现在不同数据量和操作复杂度下各语言表现不同


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单个处理阶段，缺乏对完整ETL工作流程在不同编程语言下使用Apache Iceberg的全面性能比较

Method: 通过执行从CSV文件下载数据、转换并加载到Apache Iceberg分析表的操作，比较三种编程语言在不同数据量下的性能表现

Result: 处理5MB文件时Python最快(6.71秒)；处理1.6GB文件时各语言性能相近，Python稍快(46.34秒)；复杂操作中Scala表现最佳(374.42秒)，Python最慢(398.32秒)

Conclusion: 编程语言显著影响Apache Spark数据处理效率，Scala和Java更适合大数据量和复杂操作，Python在小数据量处理上有优势

Abstract: During the study, the results of a comparative analysis of the process of
handling large datasets using the Apache Spark platform in Java, Python, and
Scala programming languages were obtained. Although prior works have focused on
individual stages, comprehensive comparisons of full ETL workflows across
programming languages using Apache Iceberg remain limited. The analysis was
performed by executing several operations, including downloading data from CSV
files, transforming and loading it into an Apache Iceberg analytical table. It
was found that the performance of the Spark algorithm varies significantly
depending on the amount of data and the programming language used. When
processing a 5-megabyte CSV file, the best result was achieved in Python: 6.71
seconds, which is superior to Scala's score of 9.13 seconds and Java's time of
9.62 seconds. For processing a large CSV file of 1.6 gigabytes, all programming
languages demonstrated similar results: the fastest performance was showed in
Python: 46.34 seconds, while Scala and Java showed results of 47.72 and 50.56
seconds, respectively. When performing a more complex operation that involved
combining two CSV files into a single dataset for further loading into an
Apache Iceberg table, Scala demonstrated the highest performance, at 374.42
seconds. Java processing was completed in 379.8 seconds, while Python was the
least efficient, with a runtime of 398.32 seconds. It follows that the
programming language significantly affects the efficiency of data processing by
the Apache Spark algorithm, with Scala and Java being more productive for
processing large amounts of data and complex operations, while Python
demonstrates an advantage in working with small amounts of data. The results
obtained can be useful for optimizing data handling processes depending on
specific performance requirements and the amount of information being
processed.

### [6] [Next Generation Cloud-native In-Memory Stores: From Redis to Valkey and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19805)
*Carl-Johan Fauvelle Munck af Rosensch"old,Feras M. Awaysheh,Ahmad Awad*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文对Redis替代品Valkey、KeyDB和Garnet在Kubernetes部署下进行了基准测试，评估了吞吐量、延迟、资源效率和迁移复杂性等指标，揭示了性能、兼容性和长期可行性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献缺乏对内存键值数据存储领域最先进工具的实证评估，而这类工具在现代云原生基础设施中至关重要，但其发展面临可扩展性、兼容性和可持续性约束。

Method: 在Kubernetes部署中使用真实工作负载对Valkey、KeyDB和Garnet进行基准测试，系统评估吞吐量、尾部延迟、CPU和内存效率以及迁移复杂性等指标。

Result: 结果显示被测试的数据系统之间存在明显的权衡关系，提供了对新兴内存键值存储的全面性能和可行性评估。

Conclusion: 研究强调了性能、兼容性和长期可行性之间的权衡，包括项目成熟度、社区支持和持续开发等方面。

Abstract: In-memory key-value datastores have become indispensable building blocks of
modern cloud-native infrastructures, yet their evolution faces scalability,
compatibility, and sustainability constraints. The current literature lacks an
experimental evaluation of state-of-the-art tools in the domain. This study
addressed this timely gap by benchmarking Redis alternatives and systematically
evaluating Valkey, KeyDB, and Garnet under realistic workloads within
Kubernetes deployments. The results demonstrate clear trade-offs among the
benchmarked data systems. Our study presents a comprehensive performance and
viability assessment of the emerging in-memory key-value stores. Metrics
include throughput, tail latency, CPU and memory efficiency, and migration
complexity. We highlight trade-offs between performance, compatibility, and
long-term viability, including project maturity, community support, and
sustained development.

### [7] [RailS: Load Balancing for All-to-All Communication in Distributed Mixture-of-Experts Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19262)
*Heng Xu,Zhiwei Yu,Chengze Du,Ying Zhou,Letian Li,Haojie Wang,Weiqiang Cheng,Jialong Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: RailS是一个分布式负载均衡框架，通过利用Rail架构的拓扑对称性，将全局协调转化为本地调度，显著提升MoE训练中的all-to-all通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型训练中的稀疏且高度不平衡的all-to-all通信主导了迭代时间，传统负载均衡方法无法充分利用Rail架构的多NIC带宽。

Method: 利用Rail拓扑的对称性证明均匀发送确保均匀接收，每个节点独立执行LPT喷涂调度器进行本地调度，激活N条并行rail进行细粒度多路径传输。

Result: 在合成和真实MoE工作负载中，RailS提升总线带宽20%-78%，减少完成时间17%-78%，在Mixtral工作负载中缩短迭代时间18%-40%。

Conclusion: RailS实现了近乎最优的负载均衡，充分利用了分布式训练中的架构并行性。

Abstract: Training Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models introduces sparse and highly
imbalanced all-to-all communication that dominates iteration time. Conventional
load-balancing methods fail to exploit the deterministic topology of Rail
architectures, leaving multi-NIC bandwidth underutilized. We present RailS, a
distributed load-balancing framework that minimizes all-to-all completion time
in MoE training. RailS leverages the Rail topology's symmetry to prove that
uniform sending ensures uniform receiving, transforming global coordination
into local scheduling. Each node independently executes a Longest Processing
Time First (LPT) spraying scheduler to proactively balance traffic using local
information. RailS activates N parallel rails for fine-grained, topology-aware
multipath transmission. Across synthetic and real-world MoE workloads, RailS
improves bus bandwidth by 20%--78% and reduces completion time by 17%--78%. For
Mixtral workloads, it shortens iteration time by 18%--40% and achieves
near-optimal load balance, fully exploiting architectural parallelism in
distributed training.

### [8] [On the Randomized Locality of Matching Problems in Regular Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19151)
*Seri Khoury,Manish Purohit,Aaron Schild,Joshua Wang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文研究了正则图中匹配问题的局部性，证明了(1+ε)-近似匹配是真正局部的，仅依赖于ε而与图参数无关，而最大匹配则需要依赖节点数n或度数Δ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分布式对称性破缺问题的局部性，特别是正则图中匹配问题的局部性，这是建立对称性破缺问题局部性下界和分类结果的主要基准。

Method: 开发随机化算法，使用基于鞅的新颖分析来分析Luby算法，证明在正则图的线图上应用一轮Luby算法会产生几乎Δ/2-正则图。

Result: (1+ε)-近似匹配在正则图中是真正局部的，仅依赖于ε；当Δ≥poly(1/ε)时，这种依赖关系仅为1/ε的对数。最大匹配在正则图中的节点平均复杂度仅为O(1)，与最坏情况复杂度形成强烈分离。

Conclusion: 近似匹配和最大匹配在正则图中具有不同的局部性特征，近似匹配是真正局部的，而最大匹配需要依赖图参数，且节点平均复杂度和最坏情况复杂度存在显著差异。

Abstract: The main goal in distributed symmetry-breaking is to understand the locality
of problems; i.e., the radius of the neighborhood that a node needs to explore
in order to arrive at its part of a global solution. In this work, we study the
locality of matching problems in the family of regular graphs, which is one of
the main benchmarks for establishing lower bounds on the locality of
symmetry-breaking problems, as well as for obtaining classification results.
For approximate matching, we develop randomized algorithms to show that $(1 +
\epsilon)$-approximate matching in regular graphs is truly local; i.e., the
locality depends only on $\epsilon$ and is independent of all other graph
parameters. Furthermore, as long as the degree $\Delta$ is not very small
(namely, as long as $\Delta \geq \text{poly}(1/\epsilon)$), this dependence is
only logarithmic in $1/\epsilon$. This stands in sharp contrast to maximal
matching in regular graphs which requires some dependence on the number of
nodes $n$ or the degree $\Delta$. We show matching lower bounds for both
results. For maximal matching, our techniques further allow us to establish a
strong separation between the node-averaged complexity and worst-case
complexity of maximal matching in regular graphs, by showing that the former is
only $O(1)$. Central to our main technical contribution is a novel
martingale-based analysis for the $\approx 40$-year-old algorithm by Luby. In
particular, our analysis shows that applying one round of Luby's algorithm on
the line graph of a $\Delta$-regular graph results in an almost
$\Delta/2$-regular graph.

### [9] [CommonSense: Efficient Set Intersection (SetX) Protocol Based on Compressed Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19725)
*Jingfan Meng,Tianji Yang,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个专门用于集合交集(SetX)问题的多轮协议，通过压缩感知技术显著降低了通信成本，相比现有的基于集合协调(SetR)的解决方案实现了8-10倍的通信效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的集合交集解决方案通常复用集合协调协议，但SetX问题本质上比SetR问题成本更低，需要专门的优化协议来充分利用这一特性。

Method: 使用多轮协议和压缩感知技术：Alice发送A的CS草图给Bob，Bob识别其独特元素；如果A不是B的子集，Bob发送剩余元素的CS草图给Alice解码她的独特元素；双方通过多轮通信更新集合直到达成交集共识。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该SetX协议相比基于IBLT的SetR协议将通信成本降低了8-10倍。

Conclusion: SetX问题在通信成本上具有显著优势，专门的SetX协议能够突破SetR问题的信息论下界，实现更高效的集合交集计算。

Abstract: In the set reconciliation (\textsf{SetR}) problem, two parties Alice and Bob,
holding sets $\mathsf{A}$ and $\mathsf{B}$, communicate to learn the symmetric
difference $\mathsf{A} \Delta \mathsf{B}$. In this work, we study a related but
under-explored problem: set intersection (\textsf{SetX})~\cite{Ozisik2019},
where both parties learn $\mathsf{A} \cap \mathsf{B}$ instead. However,
existing solutions typically reuse \textsf{SetR} protocols due to the absence
of dedicated \textsf{SetX} protocols and the misconception that \textsf{SetR}
and \textsf{SetX} have comparable costs. Observing that \textsf{SetX} is
fundamentally cheaper than \textsf{SetR}, we developed a multi-round
\textsf{SetX} protocol that outperforms the information-theoretic lower bound
of \textsf{SetR} problem. In our \textsf{SetX} protocol, Alice sends Bob a
compressed sensing (CS) sketch of $\mathsf{A}$ to help Bob identify his unique
elements (those in $\mathsf{B \setminus A}$). This solves the \textsf{SetX}
problem, if $\mathsf{A} \subseteq \mathsf{B}$. Otherwise, Bob sends a CS sketch
of the residue (a set of elements he cannot decode) back to Alice for her to
decode her unique elements (those in $\mathsf{A \setminus B}$). As such, Alice
and Bob communicate back and forth %with a set membership filter (SMF) of
estimated $\mathsf{B \setminus A}$. Alice updates $\mathsf{A}$ and
communication repeats until both parties agrees on $\mathsf{A} \cap
\mathsf{B}$. On real world datasets, experiments show that our $\mathsf{SetX}$
protocol reduces the communication cost by 8 to 10 times compared to the
IBLT-based $\mathsf{SetR}$ protocol.

### [10] [RLBoost: Harvesting Preemptible Resources for Cost-Efficient Reinforcement Learning on LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19225)
*Yongji Wu,Xueshen Liu,Haizhong Zheng,Juncheng Gu,Beidi Chen,Z. Morley Mao,Arvind Krishnamurthy,Ion Stoica*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: RLBoost是一个利用可抢占GPU资源进行成本高效强化学习训练的系统解决方案，通过混合架构和三项关键技术，显著提升训练吞吐量和成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL框架存在资源利用问题：共置架构无法解决rollout和训练阶段的资源需求冲突，分离架构则导致资源利用率低下。同时，可抢占GPU资源为加速RL工作流提供了显著的成本节约机会。

Method: 采用混合架构，包含三项关键技术：(1)自适应rollout卸载动态调整保留集群上的工作负载；(2)基于拉取的权重转移快速配置新可用实例；(3)令牌级响应收集和迁移用于高效抢占处理和持续负载均衡。

Result: 实验表明，RLBoost相比仅使用按需GPU资源，训练吞吐量提高1.51x-1.97x，成本效率提升28%-49%。

Conclusion: RLBoost通过有效利用可抢占GPU资源，成功解决了RL训练中的资源利用问题，实现了显著的性能提升和成本节约。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become essential for unlocking advanced
reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). RL workflows involve
interleaving rollout and training stages with fundamentally different resource
requirements. Rollout typically dominates overall execution time, yet scales
efficiently through multiple independent instances. In contrast, training
requires tightly-coupled GPUs with full-mesh communication. Existing RL
frameworks fall into two categories: co-located and disaggregated
architectures. Co-located ones fail to address this resource tension by forcing
both stages to share the same GPUs. Disaggregated architectures, without
modifications of well-established RL algorithms, suffer from resource
under-utilization. Meanwhile, preemptible GPU resources, i.e., spot instances
on public clouds and spare capacity in production clusters, present significant
cost-saving opportunities for accelerating RL workflows, if efficiently
harvested for rollout.
  In this paper, we present RLBoost, a systematic solution for cost-efficient
RL training that harvests preemptible GPU resources. Our key insight is that
rollout's stateless and embarrassingly parallel nature aligns perfectly with
preemptible and often fragmented resources. To efficiently utilize these
resources despite frequent and unpredictable availability changes, RLBoost
adopts a hybrid architecture with three key techniques: (1) adaptive rollout
offload to dynamically adjust workloads on the reserved (on-demand) cluster,
(2) pull-based weight transfer that quickly provisions newly available
instances, and (3) token-level response collection and migration for efficient
preemption handling and continuous load balancing. Extensive experiments show
RLBoost increases training throughput by 1.51x-1.97x while improving cost
efficiency by 28%-49% compared to using only on-demand GPU resources.

*Ziheng Deng,Xue Liu,Jiantong Jiang,Yankai Li,Qingxu Deng,Xiaochun Yang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了FLASH Viterbi算法，一种快速、轻量、自适应且硬件友好的Viterbi解码算子，通过非递归分治策略和剪枝并行化技术提升时间和内存效率，适用于资源受限的数据系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着工作负载迁移到资源受限的边缘平台，标准Viterbi解码存在内存密集和计算不灵活的问题，现有方法在解码时间和空间效率之间存在权衡，且缺乏对系统约束的适应性。

Method: 结合非递归分治策略与剪枝和并行化技术；提出FLASH-BS Viterbi变体，基于内存高效数据结构构建动态波束搜索；开发FPGA硬件加速器。

Result: 实验表明，所提算法在解码时间和内存效率上持续优于现有基线方法，同时保持适应性和硬件友好特性。

Conclusion: FLASH Viterbi算法在资源受限的数据系统中表现出色，具有良好的适应性和硬件友好性，代码已开源。

Abstract: The Viterbi algorithm is a key operator for structured sequence inference in
modern data systems, with applications in trajectory analysis, online
recommendation, and speech recognition. As these workloads increasingly migrate
to resource-constrained edge platforms, standard Viterbi decoding remains
memory-intensive and computationally inflexible. Existing methods typically
trade decoding time for space efficiency, but often incur significant runtime
overhead and lack adaptability to various system constraints. This paper
presents FLASH Viterbi, a Fast, Lightweight, Adaptive, and Hardware-Friendly
Viterbi decoding operator that enhances adaptability and resource efficiency.
FLASH Viterbi combines a non-recursive divide-and-conquer strategy with pruning
and parallelization techniques to enhance both time and memory efficiency,
making it well-suited for resource-constrained data systems.To further decouple
space complexity from the hidden state space size, we present FLASH-BS Viterbi,
a dynamic beam search variant built on a memory-efficient data structure. Both
proposed algorithms exhibit strong adaptivity to diverse deployment scenarios
by dynamically tuning internal parameters.To ensure practical deployment on
edge devices, we also develop FPGA-based hardware accelerators for both
algorithms, demonstrating high throughput and low resource usage. Extensive
experiments show that our algorithms consistently outperform existing baselines
in both decoding time and memory efficiency, while preserving adaptability and
hardware-friendly characteristics essential for modern data systems. All codes

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: HybridEP是一个针对跨数据中心MoE专家并行训练的优化框架，通过动态调整专家布局来减少通信开销，在受限带宽下实现高达5.6倍的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MoE模型规模的快速增长，单数据中心训练已无法满足需求，转向跨数据中心训练。但在低带宽环境下，现有的专家并行优化方法效果有限，成为MoE模型继续扩展的关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出HybridEP框架：1）建立流式模型确定最优传输比例；2）基于域的分区构建混合模式与GPU级通信拓扑的映射；3）参数高效迁移技术减少专家传输开销并扩大域规模。

Result: 实验结果显示HybridEP在受限带宽下比现有最先进的MoE训练系统性能提升高达5.6倍。在1000个数据中心的大规模模拟中，在不同带宽下实现最高1.45倍的加速比。

Conclusion: HybridEP是一个更具通用性和可扩展性的专家并行框架，能够有效解决跨数据中心MoE训练中的通信瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a popular architecture for scaling large
models. However, the rapidly growing scale outpaces model training on a single
DC, driving a shift toward a more flexible, cross-DC training paradigm. Under
this, Expert Parallelism (EP) of MoE faces significant scalability issues due
to the limited cross-DC bandwidth. Specifically, existing EP optimizations
attempt to overlap data communication and computation, which has little benefit
in low-bandwidth scenarios due to a much longer data communication time.
Therefore, the trends of cross-DC EP scaling is fast becoming a critical
roadblock to the continued growth of MoE models.
  To address this, we propose HybridEP, a modeling-guided framework to optimize
EP under constrained bandwidth. Our key idea is to dynamically transform the
spatial placement of experts to reduce data communication traffic and
frequency, thereby minimizing EP's communication overheads. However, it is
non-trivial to find the optimal solution because it complicates the original
communication pattern by mixing data and expert communication. We therefore
build a stream-based model to determine the optimal transmission ratio. Guided
by this, we incorporate two techniques: (1) domain-based partition to construct
the mapping between hybrid patterns and specific communication topology at GPU
level, and (2) parameter-efficient migration to further refine this topology by
reducing expert transmission overhead and enlarging the domain size. Combining
all these designs, HybridEP can be considered as a more general EP with better
scalability. Experimental results show that HybridEP outperforms existing
state-of-the-art MoE training systems by up to 5.6x under constrained
bandwidth. We further compare HybridEP and EP on large-scale simulations.

*Eric Ding*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Propius是一个用于协作机器学习的资源管理系统，通过控制平面和数据平面的设计，解决了现有系统在资源利用率、可扩展性和多租户支持方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前协作机器学习系统多为特定用例构建，缺乏可扩展性和可重用性。随着协作机器学习规模扩大，需要高效的多租户资源管理系统来应对异构客户端机器和计算流的挑战。

Method: Propius系统采用控制平面和数据平面的双层架构。控制平面实现多协作ML作业间的资源高效共享，支持多种资源共享策略；数据平面提升协作ML模型共享和结果收集的可扩展性。

Result: 评估显示Propius在资源利用率（最高提升1.88倍）、吞吐量（最高提升2.76倍）和作业完成时间（最高提升1.26倍）方面优于现有资源管理技术和框架。

Conclusion: Propius系统能够适应客户端机器的异构性，以可扩展的方式高效管理和控制ML作业与边缘资源之间的计算流，为大规模协作机器学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative Machine Learning is a paradigm in the field of distributed
machine learning, designed to address the challenges of data privacy,
communication overhead, and model heterogeneity. There have been significant
advancements in optimization and communication algorithm design and ML hardware
that enables fair, efficient and secure collaborative ML training. However,
less emphasis is put on collaborative ML infrastructure development. Developers
and researchers often build server-client systems for a specific collaborative
ML use case, which is not scalable and reusable. As the scale of collaborative
ML grows, the need for a scalable, efficient, and ideally multi-tenant resource
management system becomes more pressing. We propose a novel system, Propius,
that can adapt to the heterogeneity of client machines, and efficiently manage
and control the computation flow between ML jobs and edge resources in a
scalable fashion. Propius is comprised of a control plane and a data plane. The
control plane enables efficient resource sharing among multiple collaborative
ML jobs and supports various resource sharing policies, while the data plane
improves the scalability of collaborative ML model sharing and result
collection. Evaluations show that Propius outperforms existing resource
management techniques and frameworks in terms of resource utilization (up to
$1.88\times$), throughput (up to $2.76$), and job completion time (up to
$1.26\times$).

TL;DR: 提出了一个面向生产的BDaaS蓝图，集成单节点无服务器GPU运行时与TabNet，在监管环境中实现高性能、低成本和合规的表格数据分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布式框架如Spark和Flink在大规模分析中有效，但存在协调复杂性和审计开销，不适合中等规模、延迟敏感的推理场景。云提供商提供无服务器GPU和TabNet等可解释模型，为监管环境部署提供了新机会。

Method: 设计了一个BDaaS蓝图，结合单节点无服务器GPU运行时和TabNet模型，利用GPU加速提高吞吐量，无服务器弹性降低成本，特征掩码可解释性满足IL4/FIPS合规要求。

Result: 在HR、Adult和BLS数据集上的基准测试显示，GPU流水线相比Spark基线实现高达4.5倍的吞吐量提升、98倍的延迟降低和90%的每千次推理成本降低，合规机制仅增加约5.7ms延迟。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了合规感知的基准测试、可复现的Helm打包蓝图和决策框架，证明了在监管企业和政府环境中实现安全、可解释和成本效益的无服务器GPU分析的可行性。

Abstract: Industrial and government organizations increasingly depend on data-driven
analytics for workforce, finance, and regulated decision processes, where
timeliness, cost efficiency, and compliance are critical. Distributed
frameworks such as Spark and Flink remain effective for massive-scale batch or
streaming analytics but introduce coordination complexity and auditing
overheads that misalign with moderate-scale, latency-sensitive inference.
Meanwhile, cloud providers now offer serverless GPUs, and models such as TabNet
enable interpretable tabular ML, motivating new deployment blueprints for
regulated environments. In this paper, we present a production-oriented Big
Data as a Service (BDaaS) blueprint that integrates a single-node serverless
GPU runtime with TabNet. The design leverages GPU acceleration for throughput,
serverless elasticity for cost reduction, and feature-mask interpretability for
IL4/FIPS compliance. We conduct benchmarks on the HR, Adult, and BLS datasets,
comparing our approach against Spark and CPU baselines. Our results show that
GPU pipelines achieve up to 4.5x higher throughput, 98x lower latency, and 90%
lower cost per 1K inferences compared to Spark baselines, while compliance
mechanisms add only ~5.7 ms latency with p99 < 22 ms. Interpretability remains
stable under peak load, ensuring reliable auditability. Taken together, these
findings provide a compliance-aware benchmark, a reproducible Helm-packaged
blueprint, and a decision framework that demonstrate the practicality of
secure, interpretable, and cost-efficient serverless GPU analytics for
regulated enterprise and government settings.

### [15] [From Unweighted to Weighted Dynamic Matching in Non-Bipartite Graphs: A Low-Loss Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19049)
*Aaron Bernstein,Jiale Chen*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了首个低损失缩减方法，将二分图上的动态最大基数匹配算法转化为一般图上的动态最大权重匹配算法，仅需多项式对数时间开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非二分图中动态最大权重匹配问题与最大基数匹配算法之间的性能差距，此前方法存在1/2的近似损失。

Method: 使用新的原始-对偶框架，将一般图的近似最大权重匹配计算转化为辅助二分扩展图上的近似诱导匹配查询序列。

Result: 实现了从二分图(1-ε)近似MCM算法到一般图(1-ε)近似MWM算法的转换，仅需poly(log n/ε)更新时间开销。

Conclusion: 显著缩小了加权与非加权动态匹配问题之间的性能差距，并给出了部分动态匹配最坏情况更新时间的条件下限。

Abstract: We study the approximate maximum weight matching (MWM) problem in a fully
dynamic graph subject to edge insertions and deletions. We design
meta-algorithms that reduce the problem to the unweighted approximate maximum
cardinality matching (MCM) problem. Despite recent progress on bipartite graphs
-- Bernstein-Dudeja-Langley (STOC 2021) and
Bernstein-Chen-Dudeja-Langley-Sidford-Tu (SODA 2025) -- the only previous
meta-algorithm that applied to non-bipartite graphs suffered a $\frac{1}{2}$
approximation loss (Stubbs-Williams, ITCS 2017). We significantly close the
weighted-and-unweighted gap by showing the first low-loss reduction that
transforms any fully dynamic $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate MCM algorithm on
bipartite graphs into a fully dynamic $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate MWM
algorithm on general (not necessarily bipartite) graphs, with only a
$\mathrm{poly}(\log n/\varepsilon)$ overhead in the update time. Central to our
approach is a new primal-dual framework that reduces the computation of an
approximate MWM in general graphs to a sequence of approximate induced matching
queries on an auxiliary bipartite extension. In addition, we give the first
conditional lower bound on approximate partially dynamic matching with
worst-case update time.

TL;DR: 构建了一个动态有序字典，支持插入/删除/排名/选择操作，在U=poly(n)时达到最优时间复杂度和接近最优的空间消耗，解决了Pibiri和Venturini提出的关于o(n)位冗余是否可能的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态数据结构中空间冗余的问题，突破所谓的树结构瓶颈，该瓶颈导致动态树结构本身就需要Ω(n)位的冗余空间

Method: 使用压缩表加权树堆作为主要技术构建块，这是一种动态平衡二叉搜索树，支持多对数时间操作，需要静态查找表但能实现显著的空间保证

Result: 实现了最优的摊销预期时间复杂度O(1 + log n / log log U)，在U=poly(n)时空间消耗接近最优，冗余空间仅为O(log U)位，如果已知n和U则进一步降至O(1)位

Conclusion: 这是第一个绕过树结构瓶颈的动态解决方案，证明了o(n)位冗余是可能的，为动态数据结构的设计提供了新的可能性

Abstract: We show how to construct a dynamic ordered dictionary, supporting
insert/delete/rank/select on a set of $n$ elements from a universe of size $U$,
that achieves the optimal amortized expected time complexity of $O(1 + \log n /
\log \log U)$, while achieving a nearly optimal space consumption of $\log
\binom{U}{n} + n / 2^{(\log n)^{\Omega(1)}} + \text{polylog}\, U$ bits in the
regime where $U = \text{poly}(n)$. This resolves an open question by Pibiri and
Venturini as to whether a redundancy (a.k.a. space overhead) of $o(n)$ bits is
possible, and is the first dynamic solution to bypass the so-called
tree-structure bottleneck, in which the bits needed to encode some dynamic tree
structure are themselves enough to force a redundancy of
$\widetilde{\Omega}(n)$ bits. Our main technical building block is a dynamic
balanced binary search tree, which we call the compressed tabulation-weighted
treap, that itself achieves a surprising time/space tradeoff. The tree supports
$\text{polylog}\, n$-time operations and requires a static lookup table of size
$\text{poly}(n) + \text{polylog}\, U$ -- but, in exchange for these, the tree
is able to achieve a remarkable space guarantee. Its total space redundancy is
$O(\log U)$ bits. In fact, if the tree is given $n$ and $U$ for free, then the
redundancy further drops to $O(1)$ bits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有两阶段次模最大化问题假设所有目标函数已知，但在实际应用中目标函数可能在线出现，因此需要研究在线版本。

Method: 针对加权阈值势函数这一重要子类，设计了在线算法，在一般拟阵和均匀拟阵约束下分别获得不同的遗憾界。

Result: 算法在一般拟阵约束下达到(1-1/e)^2-遗憾，在均匀拟阵秩k情况下达到(1-1/e)(1-e^{-k}k^k/k!)-遗憾，后者也是离线2SSM问题的最优界。

Conclusion: 提出的在线算法在理论和实验上都表现良好，为在线次模优化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Given a collection of monotone submodular functions, the goal of Two-Stage
Submodular Maximization (2SSM) [Balkanski et al., 2016] is to restrict the
ground set so an objective selected u.a.r. from the collection attains a high
maximal value, on average, when optimized over the restricted ground set. We
introduce the Online Two-Stage Submodular Maximization (O2SSM) problem, in
which the submodular objectives are revealed in an online fashion. We study
this problem for weighted threshold potential functions, a large and important
subclass of monotone submodular functions that includes influence maximization,
data summarization, and facility location, to name a few. We design an
algorithm that achieves sublinear $(1 - 1/e)^2$-regret under general matroid
constraints and $(1 - 1/e)(1-e^{-k}k^k/k!)$-regret in the case of uniform
matroids of rank $k$; the latter also yields a state-of-the-art bound for the
(offline) 2SSM problem. We empirically validate the performance of our online
algorithm with experiments on real datasets.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了二维压缩索引的理论进展，包括首个支持二维语法压缩字符串最优时间随机访问的数据结构、二维模式匹配的条件下界证明，以及多个基础二维查询的困难性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的许多数据集（如图像、地图、邻接矩阵）本质上是二维且高度可压缩的。将一维技术简单应用于二维数据会导致次优结果，因为线性化过程中会丢失基本的结构重复性，这促使开发原生二维压缩索引方案。

Method: 设计了支持二维语法压缩字符串随机访问的数据结构；使用正交向量猜想证明二维模式匹配的条件下界；分析多个基础二维查询在压缩情况下的计算复杂性。

Result: 实现了O(log n/log log n)查询时间和O(|G|log^{2+ε}n)空间的二维语法压缩字符串随机访问；证明了二维模式匹配不存在O(|G|^{2-ε}·|P|^{O(1)})时间算法；展示了多个二维查询在压缩情况下的计算困难性。

Conclusion: 这是二维压缩索引理论的重要进展，首次将二维压缩索引的复杂性与一维设置中长期存在的开放问题联系起来，为后续研究提供了理论基础和方向。

Abstract: Compressed indexing is a powerful technique that enables efficient querying
over data stored in compressed form, significantly reducing memory usage and
often accelerating computation. While extensive progress has been made for
one-dimensional strings, many real-world datasets (such as images, maps, and
adjacency matrices) are inherently two-dimensional and highly compressible.
Unfortunately, naively applying 1D techniques to 2D data leads to suboptimal
results, as fundamental structural repetition is lost during linearization.
This motivates the development of native 2D compressed indexing schemes that
preserve both compression and query efficiency.
  We present three main contributions that advance the theory of compressed
indexing for 2D strings: (1) We design the first data structure that supports
optimal-time random access to a 2D string compressed by a 2D grammar.
Specifically, for a 2D string $T\in\Sigma^{r\times c}$ compressed by a 2D
grammar $G$ and any constant $\epsilon>0$, we achieve $O(\log n/\log \log n)$
query time and $O(|G|\log^{2+\epsilon}n)$ space, where $n=\max(r,c)$. (2) We
prove conditional lower bounds for pattern matching over 2D-grammar compressed
strings. Assuming the Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture, no algorithm can solve
this problem in time $O(|G|^{2-\epsilon}\cdot |P|^{O(1)})$ for any
$\epsilon>0$, demonstrating a separation from the 1D case, where optimal
solutions exist. (3) We show that several fundamental 2D queries, such as the
2D longest common extension, rectangle sum, and equality, cannot be supported
efficiently under hardness assumptions for rank and symbol occurrence queries
on 1D grammar-compressed strings. This is the first evidence connecting the
complexity of 2D compressed indexing to long-standing open problems in the 1D
setting.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we show new strongly polynomial work-depth tradeoffs for
computing single-source shortest paths (SSSP) in non-negatively weighted
directed graphs in parallel. Most importantly, we prove that directed SSSP can
be solved within $\tilde{O}(m+n^{2-\epsilon})$ work and
$\tilde{O}(n^{1-\epsilon})$ depth for some positive $\epsilon>0$. In
particular, for dense graphs with non-negative real weights, we provide the
first nearly work-efficient strongly polynomial algorithm with sublinear depth.
  Our result immediately yields improved strongly polynomial parallel
algorithms for min-cost flow and the assignment problem. It also leads to the
first non-trivial strongly polynomial dynamic algorithm for minimum mean cycle.
Moreover, we develop efficient parallel algorithms in the Word RAM model for
several variants of SSSP in graphs with exponentially large edge weights.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文引入了一种新的逻辑系统NEO₂[FRec]+ACK，能够统一描述在树深度为k的图上具有2^O(k)n^O(1)时间复杂度和n^O(1)空间复杂度的NP难问题，并提供了相应的模型检查算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了统一和扩展已知在树深度有界图上可高效求解的NP难问题（如独立集、哈密顿回路等）的理论框架，需要一个能够捕获这些问题的表达能力强的逻辑系统。

Method: 提出了NEO₂[FRec]+ACK逻辑，扩展了完全存在性MSO₂，增加了邻域查询、连通性/无环性验证和团检测等谓词，并设计了相应的模型检查算法。

Result: 为NEO₂[FRec]+ACK提供了时间2^O(k)n^O(1)、空间n^O(1)的模型检查算法；对于不含连通性和无环性约束的片段NEO₂[FRec]+k，空间复杂度可降至O(k log n)。

Conclusion: 该逻辑系统统一了树深度有界图上可高效求解的NP难问题类，并为之前未知存在高效算法的问题提供了解决方案，包括CNF-SAT和模计数问题。

Abstract: For a graph $G$, the parameter treedepth measures the minimum depth among all
forests $F$, called elimination forests, such that $G$ is a subgraph of the
ancestor-descendant closure of $F$. We introduce a logic, called neighborhood
operator logic with acyclicity, connectivity and clique constraints
($\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{ACK}$ for short), that captures all
NP-hard problems$\unicode{x2013}$like Independent Set or Hamiltonian
Cycle$\unicode{x2013}$that are known to be tractable in time
$2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ and space $n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ on
$n$-vertex graphs provided with elimination forests of depth $k$. We provide a
model checking algorithm for $\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{ACK}$ with
such complexity that unifies and extends these results. For
$\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{k}$, the fragment of the above logic
that does not use acyclicity and connectivity constraints, we get a
strengthening of this result, where the space complexity is reduced to
$\mathcal{O}(k\log(n))$.
  With a similar mechanism as the distance neighborhood logic introduced in
[Bergougnoux, Dreier and Jaffke, SODA 2023], the logic
$\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{ACK}$ is an extension of the
fully-existential $\mathsf{MSO}_2$ with predicates for (1) querying
generalizations of the neighborhoods of vertex sets, (2) verifying the
connectivity and acyclicity of vertex and edge sets, and (3) verifying that a
vertex set induces a clique. Our results provide
$2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time and $n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ space
algorithms for problems for which the existence of such algorithms was
previously unknown. In particular, $\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]$ captures
CNF-SAT via the incidence graphs associated to CNF formulas, and it also
captures several modulo counting problems like Odd Dominating Set.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个双向归约，证明后缀数组查询与前缀选择查询在除查询时间中O(log log n)项外的所有参数上等价，统一了先前方法并建立了字符串处理问题的统一分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当无法显式存储后缀数组时如何高效访问其条目，解决先前单向归约方法的局限性，探索不同技术是否能改进现有边界。

Method: 提出双向归约方法，证明后缀数组查询与前缀选择查询的等价性，并扩展到逆后缀数组查询、模式排名、字典序范围和SA区间查询等六个核心问题对。

Result: 建立了后缀数组查询与前缀选择查询的等价关系，统一了字符串和前缀查询模型，为分析基础字符串处理问题的效率提供了统一框架。

Conclusion: 该框架通过前缀查询的视角为分析和改进基础字符串处理问题的效率提供了统一基础，表明几乎所有高效的后缀数组表示都可以通过前缀选择结构来表达。

Abstract: We study the fundamental question of how efficiently suffix array entries can
be accessed when the array cannot be stored explicitly. The suffix array
$SA_T[1..n]$ of a text $T$ of length $n$ encodes the lexicographic order of its
suffixes and underlies numerous applications in pattern matching, data
compression, and bioinformatics. Previous work established one-way reductions
showing how suffix array queries can be answered using, for example, rank
queries on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform. More recently, a new class of prefix
queries was introduced, together with reductions that, among others, transform
a simple tradeoff for prefix-select queries into a suffix array tradeoff
matching state-of-the-art space and query-time bounds, while achieving
sublinear construction time. For binary texts, the resulting data structure
achieves space $O(n)$ bits, preprocessing time $O(n / \sqrt{\log n})$,
preprocessing space of $O(n)$ bits, and query time $O(\log^{\epsilon} n)$ for
any constant $\epsilon > 0$. However, whether these bounds could be improved
using different techniques has remained open.
  We resolve this question by presenting the first bidirectional reduction
showing that suffix array queries are, up to an additive $O(\log\log n)$ term
in query time, equivalent to prefix-select queries in all parameters. This
result unifies prior approaches and shows that essentially all efficient suffix
array representations can be expressed via prefix-select structures. Moreover,
we prove analogous equivalences for inverse suffix array queries, pattern
ranking, lexicographic range, and SA-interval queries, identifying six core
problem pairs that connect string and prefix query models. Our framework thus
provides a unified foundation for analyzing and improving the efficiency of
fundamental string-processing problems through the lens of prefix queries.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了压缩数据结构中各种字符串查询的时间复杂度下界，证明了在O(δ(T)log^O(1)n)空间内，SA、SA^{-1}、LCP、LCE查询需要Ω(log n/log log n)时间，而BWT、PLCP、LF等查询需要Ω(log log n)时间，建立了清晰的时间复杂度二分法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前压缩数据结构中，几乎所有基本查询都能在O(δ(T)log^O(1)n)空间内高效支持，但只有随机访问查询的最优时间复杂度被完全表征。其他重要查询的最优时间复杂度下界仍存在空白。

Method: 通过理论分析证明各种字符串查询在压缩空间下的时间复杂度下界，包括SA、SA^{-1}、LCP、LCE查询需要Ω(log n/log log n)时间，BWT、PLCP、LF等查询需要Ω(log log n)时间。

Result: 建立了压缩索引中查询时间复杂度的完整理论框架：核心字符串查询的最优时间复杂度要么是Θ(log n/log log n)，要么是Θ(log log n)。这些下界即使在二进制字母表上也成立。

Conclusion: 这项工作完成了压缩索引的理论基础，填补了上下界之间的关键空白，为未来数据结构设计提供了明确目标：在最小空间中寻求最优时间，或在最优空间中寻求最快时间。

Abstract: In this work, we study the limits of compressed data structures, i.e.,
structures that support various queries on an input text $T\in\Sigma^n$ using
space proportional to the size of $T$ in compressed form. Nearly all
fundamental queries can currently be efficiently supported in
$O(\delta(T)\log^{O(1)}n)$ space, where $\delta(T)$ is the substring
complexity, a strong compressibility measure that lower-bounds the optimal
space to represent the text [Kociumaka, Navarro, Prezza, IEEE Trans. Inf.
Theory 2023]. However, optimal query time has been characterized only for
random access.
  We address this gap by developing tight lower bounds for nearly all other
fundamental queries: (1) We prove that suffix array (SA), inverse suffix array
(SA$^{-1}$), longest common prefix (LCP) array, and longest common extension
(LCE) queries all require $\Omega(\log n/\log\log n)$ time within
$O(\delta(T)\log^{O(1)}n)$ space, matching known upper bounds. (2) We further
show that other common queries, currently supported in $O(\log\log n)$ time and
$O(\delta(T)\log^{O(1)}n)$ space, including the Burrows-Wheeler Transform
(BWT), permuted longest common prefix (PLCP) array, Last-to-First (LF), inverse
LF, lexicographic predecessor ($\Phi$), and inverse $\Phi$ queries, all require
$\Omega(\log\log n)$ time, yielding another set of tight bounds.
  Our lower bounds hold even for texts over a binary alphabet. This work
establishes a clean dichotomy: the optimal time complexity to support central
string queries in compressed space is either $\Theta(\log n/\log\log n)$ or
$\Theta(\log\log n)$. This completes the theoretical foundation of compressed
indexing, closing a crucial gap between upper and lower bounds and providing a
clear target for future data structures: seeking either the optimal time in the
smallest space or the fastest time in the optimal space, both of which are now
known for central string queries.

Motivation: 受人类和动物学习过程中因错误产生的尴尬情绪驱动快速修正的启发，就像训练小狗避免重复错误一样，旨在让LLM从代码生成错误中更有效地学习。

Method: 使用轻量级多层感知机为代码生成轨迹标记情感价和惊喜度，将高负价（尴尬）的代码错误片段优先放入Dream Queue进行5倍重放，同时修剪低惊喜度的成功案例以防止过度自信。

Result: 在HumanEval和BigCodeBench等代码生成基准测试中，CosmoCore将幻觉代码（如语法错误或逻辑bug）减少48%，自我修正速度提升45%。消融实验证实情感价标记能增强探索好奇心，修剪能提高效率。

Conclusion: 该框架扩展了基于人类反馈的强化学习，为代码助手提供更情感感知的能力，可应用于IDE和数据管道，相关代码和模拟环境已发布。

Abstract: We introduce CosmoCore, a neuroscience-inspired reinforcement learning (RL)
architecture that integrates affective signals to enhance code generation in
large language models (LLMs). Motivated by human and animal learning where
embarrassment from mistakes drives rapid correction, as observed in training a
puppy to avoid repeating errors after a single scolding CosmoCore tags code
generation trajectories with valence and surprise using a lightweight
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). High-negative valence (cringe) episodes, such as
buggy code outputs, are prioritized in a Dream Queue for five-fold replay
during off-policy updates, while low-surprise successes are pruned to prevent
overconfidence and buffer bloat. Evaluated on code generation benchmarks like
HumanEval and BigCodeBench, alongside simulations with a custom data pipeline
environment, CosmoCore reduces hallucinated code (e.g., syntax errors or
logical bugs) by 48\% and accelerates self-correction by 45\%. Local
experiments using Hugging Face models in a PySpark environment validate these
gains, with code snippets provided for replication. Ablations confirm valence
tagging boosts curiosity in exploration, and pruning mitigates inefficiency.
This framework extends RL from human feedback (RLHF) for more emotionally aware
code assistants, with applications in IDEs and data pipelines. Code and the
custom mini-world simulation are released.

Abstract: With the recent rapid increase in digitization across all major industries,
acquiring programming skills has increased the demand for introductory
programming courses. This has further resulted in universities integrating
programming courses into a wide range of curricula, including not only
technical studies but also business and management fields of study.
  Consequently, additional resources are needed for teaching, grading, and
tutoring students with diverse educational backgrounds and skills. As part of
this, Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) have emerged, providing
scalable and high-quality assessment systems with efficient evaluation and
instant feedback. Commonly, APASs heavily rely on predefined unit tests for
generating feedback, often limiting the scope and level of detail of feedback
that can be provided to students. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
in recent years, new opportunities have emerged as these technologies can
enhance feedback quality and personalization.
  To investigate how different feedback mechanisms in APASs are perceived by
students, and how effective they are in supporting problem-solving, we have
conducted a large-scale study with over 200 students from two different
universities. Specifically, we compare baseline Compiler Feedback, standard
Unit Test Feedback, and advanced LLM-based Feedback regarding perceived quality
and impact on student performance.
  Results indicate that while students rate unit test feedback as the most
helpful, AI-generated feedback leads to significantly better performances.
These findings suggest combining unit tests and AI-driven guidance to optimize
automated feedback mechanisms and improve learning outcomes in programming
education.

### [25] [Extending Resource Constrained Project Scheduling to Mega-Projects with Model-Based Systems Engineering & Hetero-functional Graph Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19035)
*Amirreza Hosseini,Amro M. Farid*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文将资源受限项目调度问题（RCPSP）与基于模型的系统工程（MBSE）和异质功能图理论（HFGT）相结合，提出了从活动节点网络到SysML活动图再到操作数网络的转换流程，并将异质功能网络最小成本流（HFNMCF）公式专门应用于RCPSP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RCPSP是项目管理的核心问题，但它与基于模型的系统工程文献脱节，限制了其在复杂系统设计和管理中的集成。

Method: 构建从活动节点网络到SysML活动图再到操作数网络的转换流程，并将HFNMCF公式专门应用于RCPSP环境。

Result: 在包含可再生和不可再生操作数的示例中，专门的HFNMCF产生了相似的项目进度，同时提供了项目状态的明确解释，支持更丰富的监控和控制。

Conclusion: 该框架保留了经典RCPSP的优势，同时适应了大型复杂巨型项目中遇到的实际约束和企业级决策过程。

Abstract: Within the project management context, project scheduling serves as an
indispensable component, functioning as a fundamental tool for planning,
monitoring, controlling, and managing projects more broadly. Although the
resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) lies at the core of
project management activities, it remains largely disconnected from the broader
literature on model-based systems engineering (MBSE), thereby limiting its
integration into the design and management of complex systems. The original
contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper seeks to reconcile the
RCPSP with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems
engineering and hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT). A concrete translation
pipeline from an activity-on-node network to a SysML activity diagram, and then
to an operand net is constructed. Using this representation, it specializes the
hetero-functional network minimum-cost flow (HFNMCF) formulation to the RCPSP
context as a systematic means of HFGT for quantitative analysis and proves that
the RCPSP is recoverable as a special case of a broader model. Secondly, on an
illustrative instance with renewable and non-renewable operands, the
specialized HFNMCF, while producing similar schedules, yields explicit
explanations of the project states that enable richer monitoring and control.
Overall, the framework preserves the strengths of the classical RCPSP while
accommodating real-world constraints and enterprise-level decision processes
encountered in large, complex megaprojects.

TL;DR: 提出了ReqEBench，一个包含2,721个真实世界CPS需求的基准数据集，用于评估自动化需求关注点提取解决方案的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化需求关注点提取解决方案缺乏公平和全面的基准评估，难以评估其在真实CPS环境中的有效性。

Method: 构建包含12个真实世界CPS系统的2,721个需求的基准数据集，涵盖多个应用领域，并经过严格的标注过程。

Result: 使用ReqEBench评估三种自动化需求关注点提取方案，发现GPT-4在实体关注点提取中的最高F1分数仅为0.24。

Conclusion: ReqEBench将促进自动化需求关注点提取的评估和发展，通过分析流行LLM方案的失败案例，为改进其能力提供了思路。

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are characterized by a deep integration of the
information space and the physical world, which makes the extraction of
requirements concerns more challenging. Some automated solutions for
requirements concern extraction have been proposed to alleviate the burden on
requirements engineers. However, evaluating the effectiveness of these
solutions, which relies on fair and comprehensive benchmarks, remains an open
question. To address this gap, we propose ReqEBench, a new CPSs requirements
concern extraction benchmark, which contains 2,721 requirements from 12
real-world CPSs. ReqEBench offers four advantages. It aligns with real-world
CPSs requirements in multiple dimensions, e.g., scale and complexity. It covers
comprehensive concerns related to CPSs requirements. It undergoes a rigorous
annotation process. It covers multiple application domains of CPSs, e.g.,
aerospace and healthcare. We conducted a comparative study on three types of
automated requirements concern extraction solutions and revealed their
performance in real-world CPSs using our ReqEBench. We found that the highest
F1 score of GPT-4 is only 0.24 in entity concern extraction. We further analyze
failure cases of popular LLM-based solutions, summarize their shortcomings, and
provide ideas for improving their capabilities. We believe ReqEBench will
facilitate the evaluation and development of automated requirements concern
extraction.

TL;DR: 设计并实现了一个基于Yocto项目的集成化、可复现的Linux操作系统开发基础设施，采用三层架构确保版本同步、可扩展性和可复现性，通过CI/CD流水线和缓存优化显著提升构建效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着嵌入式系统在各行业的广泛应用，需要自动化平台来开发和部署定制化的Linux操作系统，以提高开发效率和系统可靠性。

Method: 采用三层架构：主Yocto仓库、自定义层(meta-custom)和协调清单层；实现CI/CD流水线(GitLab CI + Docker)；使用本地缓存服务器优化构建时间；通过QEMU模拟器进行6种启动测试场景验证。

Result: 构建时间显著减少；系统功能和稳定性得到验证；实现了可复现的构建过程；能够扩展到实时Linux版本等高级应用。

Conclusion: 该设计不仅确保了可复现性，还能扩展到高级应用，为嵌入式系统工业和研究项目提供了稳定、可扩展的快速可靠开发模型。

Abstract: With the growing use of embedded systems in various industries, the need for
automated platforms for the development and deployment of customized
Linux-based operating systems has become more important. This research was
conducted with the aim of designing and implementing an integrated and
reproducible infrastructure for the development, building, and testing of a
Linux-based operating system using the Yocto Project. The proposed structure
was implemented based on a three-layer architecture consisting of the main
Yocto repositories, a custom layer (meta-custom), and a coordinating manifest
layer to ensure version synchronization, scalability, and reproducibility.
Three sample projects, including libhelloworld, helloworld, and the kernel
module hello mod, were developed and integrated into the build process.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines were implemented
with GitLab CI and combined with an isolated Docker environment to automate and
streamline the build and testing workflows. Using a local cache server
containing hashserv, downloads and sstate cache significantly reduced the build
time. The functionality and stability of the system were verified through six
boot test scenarios in the QEMU simulator. The results show that the proposed
design not only ensures reproducibility but also can be extended to advanced
applications such as continuous deployment of real-time Linux versions. Future
recommendations include expanding automated tests, implementing system
monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, using distributed builds, optimizing
with Docker multi-stage builds, and enabling continuous deployment of real-time
Linux changes to provide a stable and scalable model for industrial and
research projects in embedded systems with a rapid and reliable development
cycle.

TL;DR: TRACE是一个专门检测非可编译智能合约仓库中访问控制漏洞的工具，它使用LLM补全函数代码片段为可编译合约，然后通过函数调用图和控制流图分析敏感函数来检测漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约中的访问控制漏洞已造成数十亿美元损失，现有工具无法有效处理复杂的非可编译仓库，因为它们需要目标合约可编译才能进行分析。

Method: 使用LLM定位涉及关键操作的敏感函数，补全函数代码片段为可编译合约，构建AST的函数调用图，利用每个函数的CFG作为节点信息，分析敏感函数节点检测访问控制漏洞。

Result: 在开源CVE数据集中检测出15个中的14个CVE；在5000个近期链上合约中达到89.2%的精确度；在83个真实仓库中达到87.0%的精确度，均显著优于现有最佳工具。

Conclusion: TRACE能够有效检测非可编译智能合约仓库中的访问控制漏洞，在多个数据集上表现优于现有最先进工具。

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerabilities, particularly improper Access Control that
allows unauthorized execution of restricted functions, have caused billions of
dollars in losses. GitHub hosts numerous smart contract repositories containing
source code, documentation, and configuration files-these serve as intermediate
development artifacts that must be compiled and packaged before deployment.
Third-party developers often reference, reuse, or fork code from these
repositories during custom development. However, if the referenced code
contains vulnerabilities, it can introduce significant security risks. Existing
tools for detecting smart contract vulnerabilities are limited in their ability
to handle complex repositories, as they typically require the target contract
to be compilable to generate an abstract representation for further analysis.
This paper presents TRACE, a tool designed to secure non-compilable smart
contract repositories against access control vulnerabilities. TRACE employs
LLMs to locate sensitive functions involving critical operations (e.g.,
transfer) within the contract and subsequently completes function snippets into
a fully compilable contract. TRACE constructs a function call graph from the
abstract syntax tree (AST) of the completed contract. It uses the control flow
graph (CFG) of each function as node information. The nodes of the sensitive
functions are then analyzed to detect Access Control vulnerabilities.
Experimental results demonstrate that TRACE outperforms state-of-the-art tools
on an open-sourced CVE dataset, detecting 14 out of 15 CVEs. In addition, it
achieves 89.2% precision on 5,000 recent on-chain contracts, far exceeding the
best existing tool at 76.9%. On 83 real-world repositories, TRACE achieves
87.0% precision, significantly surpassing DeepSeek-R1's 14.3%.

TL;DR: 使用基于LLM的代理系统自动化RESTful微服务的API优先开发，包括创建OpenAPI规范、生成服务器代码，并通过分析执行日志和错误消息的反馈循环来优化代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推进RESTful Web服务的API优先开发自动化，测试基于LLM的多代理系统在支持API优先开发方法中的能力。

Method: 利用基于LLM的代理系统，从OpenAPI规范生成服务器代码，并通过分析执行日志和错误消息的反馈循环来迭代优化代码。

Result: 使用PRAB基准测试表明，如果保持OpenAPI规范小而专注，LLM能够生成符合规范的完整功能代码和业务逻辑。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的多代理系统能够有效支持API优先开发方法，通过集成日志分析减少迭代次数，生成功能完善且健壮的服务。

Abstract: This paper presents a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs)-based
agents to automate the API-first development of RESTful microservices. This
system helps to create an OpenAPI specification, generate server code from it,
and refine the code through a feedback loop that analyzes execution logs and
error messages. The integration of log analysis enables the LLM to detect and
address issues efficiently, reducing the number of iterations required to
produce functional and robust services. This study's main goal is to advance
API-first development automation for RESTful web services and test the
capability of LLM-based multi-agent systems in supporting the API-first
development approach. To test the proposed system's potential, we utilized the
PRAB benchmark. The results indicate that if we keep the OpenAPI specification
small and focused, LLMs are capable of generating complete functional code with
business logic that aligns to the specification. The code for the system is
publicly available at https://github.com/sirbh/code-gen

TL;DR: 研究探讨了不同编程背景人员对位运算符的可读性和理解能力，发现某些运算符（如OR、NOT、左移）在任务完成时间上具有统计显著性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估位运算符在编程中的可读性和理解性，检验不同编程经验人员在使用位运算符时的表现差异。

Method: 采用被试内实验设计，让23名不同编程背景的参与者（从无编程经验到博士水平）在JavaScript中完成位运算符相关任务，记录任务完成时间和准确率。

Result: 运算符是预测响应时间的因素之一，具有小但显著的影响（R²=0.032，p<0.001）。OR、NOT和左移运算符在任务完成时间上显示出统计显著性。

Conclusion: 虽然位运算符的复杂性通常不会导致更长的任务完成时间，但某些运算符不够直观，需要进一步研究和重新设计以提高可理解性。

Abstract: Objectives: This study aims to investigate the readability and
understandability of bitwise operators in programming, with the main hypothesis
that there will be a difference in the performance metrics (response time and
error rate) between participants exposed to various bitwise operators related
questions and those who are not.
  Participants: Participants in this human research study include people
without programming background, novice programmers, and university students
with varying programming experience (from freshmen to PhD level). There were 23
participants for this study.
  Study Methods: This study uses an Within-Subjects Experimental Design to
assess how people with diverse programming backgrounds understand and use
bitwise operators. Participants complete tasks in JavaScript program, and their
task completion time and accuracy of the tasks are recorded for analysis.
  Findings: The results indicate that operators can be one of the factors
predicting response time, with a small but significant effect, with R-squared
0.032, (1, 494) = 16.5, p < .001. Additionally, some operators like OR, NOT,
and Left Shift showed statistical significance in task completion times
compared to other operators.
  Conclusions: While the complexity of bitwise operators did not generally
result in longer task completion times, certain operators were found to be less
intuitive, suggesting the need for further investigation and potential redesign
for improved understandability.

TL;DR: Jaralyzer是一个基于字节码分析的Java依赖扫描器，能够有效检测修改后的开源依赖中的安全漏洞，性能优于现有扫描器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代Java项目中71%的代码来自开源依赖，这带来了严重的安全风险。现有依赖扫描器在处理重新编译、重新打包等常见依赖修改时存在不足。

Method: Jaralyzer直接分析依赖的字节码，不依赖元数据或源代码，能够处理各种依赖修改情况。

Result: 在56个流行OSS组件上的评估显示，Jaralyzer在检测修改依赖中的漏洞方面优于其他扫描器，是唯一能识别所有类型修改中漏洞的扫描器。即使对未修改依赖，也比Eclipse Steady多检测28个真实漏洞，减少29个误报。

Conclusion: 字节码中心的方法在依赖漏洞检测方面具有显著优势，特别是能够有效处理Java生态系统中常见的依赖修改问题。

Abstract: On average, 71% of the code in typical Java projects comes from open-source
software (OSS) dependencies, making OSS dependencies the dominant component of
modern software code bases. This high degree of OSS reliance comes with a
considerable security risk of adding known security vulnerabilities to a code
base. To remedy this risk, researchers and companies have developed various
dependency scanners, which try to identify inclusions of known-to-be-vulnerable
OSS dependencies. However, there are still challenges that modern dependency
scanners do not overcome, especially when it comes to dependency modifications,
such as re-compilations, re-bundlings or re-packagings, which are common in the
Java ecosystem. To overcome these challenges, we present Jaralyzer, a
bytecode-centric dependency scanner for Java. Jaralyzer does not rely on the
metadata or the source code of the included OSS dependencies being available
but directly analyzes a dependency's bytecode. Our evaluation across 56 popular
OSS components demonstrates that Jaralyzer outperforms other popular dependency
scanners in detecting vulnerabilities within modified dependencies. It is the
only scanner capable of identifying vulnerabilities across all the above
mentioned types of modifications. But even when applied to unmodified
dependencies, Jaralyzer outperforms the current state-of-the-art code-centric
scanner Eclipse Steady by detecting 28 more true vulnerabilities and yielding
29 fewer false warnings.

TL;DR: AutoMT是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体蜕变测试框架，用于自动驾驶系统的自动化测试。它从交通规则中自动提取蜕变关系并生成有效的后续测试用例，相比人工方法显著提高了测试多样性和违规检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统是安全关键系统，现有蜕变测试方法依赖大量人工工作且缺乏自动化。需要一种能够自动从交通规则中提取蜕变关系并生成多样化测试用例的框架。

Method: 使用LLM从Gherkin语法的交通规则中提取蜕变关系，采用视觉语言智能体分析场景，搜索智能体从RAG数据库中检索合适的蜕变关系，通过计算机视觉生成后续测试用例。

Result: AutoMT在后续用例生成中实现了比最佳基线（人工专家定义的蜕变关系）高达5倍的测试多样性，检测到20.55%更多的行为违规。能够自动提取多样化的蜕变关系，发现现场测试和数据收集中经常遗漏的边界情况。

Conclusion: AutoMT的模块化架构支持集成到工业流程中，可能实现基于仿真的测试，系统性地覆盖代表性不足或安全关键场景。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) are safety-critical, where failures can be
severe. While Metamorphic Testing (MT) is effective for fault detection in ADS,
existing methods rely heavily on manual effort and lack automation. We present
AutoMT, a multi-agent MT framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that
automates the extraction of Metamorphic Relations (MRs) from local traffic
rules and the generation of valid follow-up test cases. AutoMT leverages LLMs
to extract MRs from traffic rules in Gherkin syntax using a predefined
ontology. A vision-language agent analyzes scenarios, and a search agent
retrieves suitable MRs from a RAG-based database to generate follow-up cases
via computer vision. Experiments show that AutoMT achieves up to 5 x higher
test diversity in follow-up case generation compared to the best baseline
(manual expert-defined MRs) in terms of validation rate, and detects up to
20.55% more behavioral violations. While manual MT relies on a fixed set of
predefined rules, AutoMT automatically extracts diverse metamorphic relations
that augment real-world datasets and help uncover corner cases often missed
during in-field testing and data collection. Its modular architecture
separating MR extraction, filtering, and test generation supports integration
into industrial pipelines and potentially enables simulation-based testing to
systematically cover underrepresented or safety-critical scenarios.

Abstract: The ongoing transformation of the European energy landscape, driven by the
integration of renewable energy sources, digital technologies, and
decentralized systems, requires a high degree of interoperability across
diverse components and systems. Ensuring that these elements can exchange
information and operate together reliably is essential for achieving a secure,
flexible, and efficient energy supply infrastructure. While several initiatives
have contributed to the development of smart grid testing infrastructures, they
do not provide a dedicated or comprehensive focus on interoperability testing.
A structured and harmonized overview of interoperability testing capabilities
across Europe is therefore still missing. This work therefore presents a novel
contribution by analyzing the European interoperability testing facility
landscape through a structured survey of 30 facilities. It provides a
categorized inventory of testing infrastructures, applied methodologies, and
reference test cases, and introduces a blueprint for the development of future
testing environments. The findings contribute to the establishment of a
coordinated European ecosystem for interoperability testing, supporting
collaboration, innovation, and alignment with the goals of the energy
transition.

Conclusion: 目标驱动的分类方法能更准确地反映RCA领域的研究现状，为未来研究提供了明确方向，并指出了该领域面临的开放挑战。

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a crucial aspect of incident management in
large-scale cloud services. While the term root cause analysis or RCA has been
widely used, different studies formulate the task differently. This is because
the term "RCA" implicitly covers tasks with distinct underlying goals. For
instance, the goal of localizing a faulty service for rapid triage is
fundamentally different from identifying a specific functional bug for a
definitive fix. However, previous surveys have largely overlooked these
goal-based distinctions, conventionally categorizing papers by input data types
(e.g., metric-based vs. trace-based methods). This leads to the grouping of
works with disparate objectives, thereby obscuring the true progress and gaps
in the field. Meanwhile, the typical audience of an RCA survey is either laymen
who want to know the goals and big picture of the task or RCA researchers who
want to figure out past research under the same task formulation. Thus, an RCA
survey that organizes the related papers according to their goals is in high
demand. To this end, this paper presents a goal-driven framework that
effectively categorizes and integrates 135 papers on RCA in the context of
cloud incident management based on their diverse goals, spanning the period
from 2014 to 2025. In addition to the goal-driven categorization, it discusses
the ultimate goal of all RCA papers as an umbrella covering different RCA
formulations. Moreover, the paper discusses open challenges and future
directions in RCA.

Result: AutoPage能在15分钟内以低于0.1美元的成本生成高质量、视觉吸引力强的网页，并构建了首个相关基准测试PageBench。

Conclusion: AutoPage成功地将论文到网页的创建过程自动化，从单纯工具转变为强大的协作助手，显著提高了科研传播效率。

Abstract: In the quest for scientific progress, communicating research is as vital as
the discovery itself. Yet, researchers are often sidetracked by the manual,
repetitive chore of building project webpages to make their dense papers
accessible. While automation has tackled static slides and posters, the
dynamic, interactive nature of webpages has remained an unaddressed challenge.
To bridge this gap, we reframe the problem, arguing that the solution lies not
in a single command, but in a collaborative, hierarchical process. We introduce
$\textbf{AutoPage}$, a novel multi-agent system that embodies this philosophy.
AutoPage deconstructs paper-to-page creation into a coarse-to-fine pipeline
from narrative planning to multimodal content generation and interactive
rendering. To combat AI hallucination, dedicated "Checker" agents verify each
step against the source paper, while optional human checkpoints ensure the
final product aligns perfectly with the author's vision, transforming the
system from a mere tool into a powerful collaborative assistant. To rigorously
validate our approach, we also construct $\textbf{PageBench}$, the first
benchmark for this new task. Experiments show AutoPage not only generates
high-quality, visually appealing pages but does so with remarkable efficiency
in under 15 minutes for less than \$0.1. Code and dataset will be released at
$\href{https://mqleet.github.io/AutoPage_ProjectPage/}{Webpage}$.

TL;DR: FidelityGPT是一个提升反编译代码准确性和可读性的框架，通过系统检测和纠正语义失真，在二进制相似性基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反编译方法存在保真度问题，导致反编译输出的可读性和语义准确性下降，特别是在复杂闭源二进制文件上缺乏鲁棒的检测和纠正机制。

Method: 引入失真感知提示模板，结合检索增强生成(RAG)和动态语义强度算法来定位失真代码行并从数据库中检索语义相似代码，使用变量依赖算法分析冗余变量并集成依赖关系到提示上下文中。

Result: 在620个函数对上的评估显示，平均检测准确率89%，精确率83%。与最先进的DeGPT相比，修复率从83%提升到94%，正确修复率从37%提升到64%。

Conclusion: FidelityGPT在准确性和可读性方面取得显著提升，展示了其在基于LLM的反编译和逆向工程中的潜力。

Abstract: Decompilation converts machine code into human-readable form, enabling
analysis and debugging without source code. However, fidelity issues often
degrade the readability and semantic accuracy of decompiled output. Existing
methods, such as variable renaming or structural simplification, provide
partial improvements but lack robust detection and correction, particularly for
complex closed-source binaries. We present FidelityGPT, a framework that
enhances decompiled code accuracy and readability by systematically detecting
and correcting semantic distortions. FidelityGPT introduces distortion-aware
prompt templates tailored to closed-source settings and integrates
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a dynamic semantic intensity
algorithm to locate distorted lines and retrieve semantically similar code from
a database. A variable dependency algorithm further mitigates long-context
limitations by analyzing redundant variables and integrating their dependencies
into the prompt context. Evaluated on 620 function pairs from a binary
similarity benchmark, FidelityGPT achieved an average detection accuracy of 89%
and a precision of 83%. Compared to the state-of-the-art DeGPT (Fix Rate 83%,
Corrected Fix Rate 37%), FidelityGPT attained 94% FR and 64% CFR, demonstrating
significant gains in accuracy and readability. These results highlight its

Main category: cs.SE

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能体AI在软件工程中引发范式转变，需要建立智能体软件工程作为研究领域，并解决早期实证研究中发现的社会技术问题。

Method: 通过分析软件工程基础、演进趋势和现有智能体SE框架，提出扩展研究范围、制定指导原则和统一词汇表的方法。

Result: 提出了'全过程'愿景、初步的价值观与原则体系，以及设计和使用明确定义词汇的指导。

Conclusion: 这些建议旨在促进社区合作，为智能体软件工程建立坚实基础，使其不仅是必然趋势，更是经过深思熟虑且长期可取的。

Abstract: Agentic AI is poised to usher in a seismic paradigm shift in Software
Engineering (SE). As technologists rush head-along to make agentic AI a
reality, SE researchers are driven to establish agentic SE as a research area.
While early visions of agentic SE are primarily focused on code-related
activities, early empirical evidence calls for a consideration of a range of
socio-technical concerns to make it work in practice. This paper contributes to
the emerging community vision by: (a) recommending an expansion of its scope
beyond code, toward a 'whole of process' vision, grounding it in SE foundations
and evolution and emerging agentic SE frameworks, (b) proposing a preliminary
set of values and principles to guide efforts, and (c) sharing guidance on
designing/using well-defined vocabulary for agentic SE. It is hoped that these
ideas will encourage community collaborations and steer the SE community
towards laying strong foundations of agentic SE so its not only inevitable but
also deliberate and desirable in the long run.

*Priyaranjan Pattnayak,Hussain Bohra*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文调查了基于大语言模型(LLM)的零代码开发平台，分析了各类平台在界面风格、后端集成、输出类型和可扩展性等维度的特点，比较了专用LLM应用构建器和通用无代码平台的优劣势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM技术的发展，零代码开发平台正在改变软件创建方式。论文旨在系统性地调查和分析这些利用LLM作为开发过程核心的零代码平台，为理解这一新兴领域提供全面框架。

Method: 采用广泛的调查方法，基于界面风格、后端集成、输出类型和可扩展性等关键维度对平台进行分类，分析专用LLM应用构建器（如OpenAI的定制GPT、Bolt.new等）和集成LLM能力的通用无代码平台（如Bubble、Glide）。

Result: 提出了一个分类法，按界面（对话式、可视化等）、支持的LLM后端、输出类型（聊天机器人、完整应用、工作流）和可扩展性程度对平台进行分类。详细比较了各平台的优缺点，并讨论了与传统和低代码开发方法相比的权衡（可定制性、可扩展性、供应商锁定）。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的零代码平台显著降低了创建AI驱动应用程序的门槛，但在灵活性和可靠性方面仍面临挑战。该领域正在快速发展，为非程序员创建复杂软件提供了令人兴奋的机会，未来方向包括多模态界面、设备端LLM和改进的编排技术。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming software creation by enabling
zero code development platforms. Our survey reviews recent platforms that let
users build applications without writing code, by leveraging LLMs as the brains
of the development process. We adopt a broad survey methodology, categorizing
platforms based on key dimensions such as interface style, backend integration,
output type, and extensibility. We analyze both dedicated LLM based app
builders (OpenAI's custom GPTs, Bolt.new, Dust.tt, Flowise, Cognosys) and
general no code platforms (e.g., Bubble, Glide) that integrate LLM
capabilities. We present a taxonomy categorizing these platforms by their
interface (conversational, visual, etc.), supported LLM backends, output type
(chatbot, full application, workflow), and degree of extensibility. Core
features such as autonomous agents, memory management, workflow orchestration,
and API integrations are in scope of the survey. We provide a detailed
comparison, highlighting each platform's strengths and limitations. Trade offs
(customizability, scalability, vendor lock-in) are discussed in comparison with
traditional and low code development approaches. Finally, we outline future
directions, including multimodal interfaces, on device LLMs, and improved
orchestration for democratizing app creation with AI. Our findings indicate
that while zero code LLM platforms greatly reduce the barrier to creating AI
powered applications, they still face challenges in flexibility and
reliability. Overall, the landscape is rapidly evolving, offering exciting
opportunities to empower non programmers to create sophisticated software.

### [40] [BOSQTGEN: Breaking the Sound Barrier in Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19777)
*S M Sadrul Islam Asif,James Chen,Earl T. Barr,Mark Marron*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: BOSQTGEN是一种新颖的黑盒API测试生成方法，通过分解API规范为原语、使用LLM建议连贯层次结构，并采用组合测试来高效采样，显著提升了测试覆盖率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件越来越依赖API组合，但API契约不足会导致期望不匹配和故障。现有测试生成技术面临多语言系统、源代码不可访问、成本可靠性权衡以及生成结构化输入困难等挑战。

Method: BOSQTGEN采用黑盒方法，将API规范分解为原语，使用LLM建议连贯层次结构，并应用组合测试来高效采样这些值，覆盖关键交互同时避免随机采样的冗余。

Result: 在RESTful基准测试中，BOSQTGEN平均达到82%的代码覆盖率，通常比先前最先进系统提高20%或更多，接近手工编写测试套件的水平。

Conclusion: BOSQTGEN提供完全API驱动的测试生成方法，使开发人员能够自动创建高质量测试用例进行验证或测试驱动开发。

Abstract: Modern software is increasingly built by composing APIs, elevating the API
contract to a critical role. Inadequate contracts, however, lead to mismatched
expectations and failures, creating a pressing need for robust conformance
testing. Current test generation techniques are hindered by key challenges:
polyglot systems, source code inaccessibility, a cost-reliability trade-off,
and, most critically, the difficulty of generating structured inputs.
  We introduce BOSQTGEN, a novel black-box methodology and tool for API test
generation. BOSQTGEN utilizes a novel approach for decomposing API
specifications into primitives, using LLMs to suggest coherent strata for them,
and employing combinatorial testing to efficiently sample over these values.
This approach ensures coverage of critical interactions while avoiding the
redundancy of random sampling.
  The resulting BOSQTGEN system achieves an average of 82% code coverage on
RESTful benchmarks, often a 20% or more increase over prior state-of-the-art
systems and nearing parity with hand-written test suites. Providing a fully
API-driven approach to test generation, enables developers to automatically
create high-quality test cases for validation or test-driven development.

### [41] [Enabling Reconfiguration-Communication Overlap for Collective Communication in Optical Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19322)
*Changbo Wu,Zhuolong Yu,Gongming Zhao,Hongli Xu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: SWOT是一个需求感知的光网络框架，通过动态调整网络资源来匹配集体通信流量模式，提高分布式机器学习训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的光互连集体通信方案采用"一次性网络重构"，为整个集体操作提供静态高容量拓扑，但在支持现代工作负载所需的更复杂高效CC算法时面临显著可扩展性限制。

Method: SWOT采用"集体内重构"，动态对齐网络资源与CC流量模式；包含新颖的调度技术，将光开关重构与传输重叠；引入轻量级集体通信shim，支持协调的光网络配置和传输调度。

Result: 模拟结果显示SWOT带来显著的性能改进。

Conclusion: SWOT框架通过动态资源分配和智能调度，有效解决了现有光互连集体通信方案的可扩展性限制问题。

Abstract: Collective communication (CC) is widely adopted for large-scale distributed
machine learning (DML) training workloads. DML's predictable traffic pattern
provides a great oppotunity for applying optical network technology. Existing
optical interconnects-based CC schemes adopt ``one-shot network
reconfiguration'', which provisions static high-capacity topologies for an
entire collective operation -- sometimes for a full training iteration.
However, this approach faces significant scalability limitations when
supporting more complex and efficient CC algorithms required for modern
workloads: the ``one-shot'' strategies either demand excessive resource
overprovisioning or suffer performance degradation due to rigid resource
allocation.
  To address these challenges, we propose SWOT, a demand-aware optical network
framework. SWOT employs ``intra-collective reconfiguration'' and can
dynamically align network resources with CC traffic patterns. SWOT incorporates
a novel scheduling technique that overlaps optical switch reconfigurations with
ongoing transmissions, and improves communication efficiency. SWOT introduce a
lightweight collective communication shim that enables coordinated optical
network configuration and transmission scheduling while supporting seamless
integration with existing CC libraries. Our simulation results demonstrate
SWOT's significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: 这是首个针对未来基于以太网的HPC架构的功率管理方案，展示了有前景的节能效果。

Abstract: The increase in computation and storage has led to a significant growth in
the scale of systems powering applications and services, raising concerns about
sustainability and operational costs. In this paper, we explore power-saving
techniques in high-performance computing (HPC) and datacenter networks, and
their relation with performance degradation. From this premise, we propose
leveraging Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE), with the flexibility to extend to
conventional Ethernet or upcoming Ethernet-derived interconnect versions of BXI
and Omnipath.
  We analyze the PerfBound proposal, identifying possible improvements and
modeling it into a simulation framework. Through different experiments, we
examine its impact on performance and determine the most appropriate
interconnect. We also study traffic patterns generated by selected HPC and
machine learning applications to evaluate the behavior of power-saving
techniques.
  From these experiments, we provide an analysis of how applications affect
system and network energy consumption. Based on this, we disclose the weakness
of dynamic power-down mechanisms and propose an approach that improves energy
reduction with minimal or no performance penalty. To our knowledge, this is the
first power management proposal tailored to future Ethernet-based HPC
architectures, with promising results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自编码器在时间序列异常检测中广泛应用，但其学习到的表示对训练时间序列中的异常敏感，导致检测精度降低。需要解决训练数据被污染时的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 提出encode-then-decompose范式，将编码表示分解为稳定表示和辅助表示；使用基于互信息的新指标替代传统的重构误差来识别异常。

Result: 在8个常用的多变量和单变量时间序列基准测试中表现出竞争性或最先进的性能，对不同污染比例的时间序列展现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的编码-分解范式和基于互信息的异常检测方法有效提升了时间序列异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个3D优化框架，联合校准AI推理扩展中的准确性、成本和延迟，通过多目标优化实现约束感知的推理扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的1D启发式和2D权衡方法未能考虑成本和延迟约束，无法在统一决策空间中优化推理扩展。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛模拟在三个代表性场景和九个模拟大语言模型上评估四种优化方法，解决3D多目标优化问题。

Result: 膝点优化实现了最佳平衡，而精度最大化在优先考虑精度时仍具有优势。该框架为不同操作环境下的部署感知推理扩展奠定了理论基础。

Conclusion: 3D多目标优化框架能够捕捉1D和2D优化无法捕获的可行空间，实现环境自适应的推理扩展参数选择。

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在神经影像应用中受限于样本量不足，而现有的自监督预训练方法未能与脑-结果关系对齐，导致基础模型对下游任务不够优化。

Method: 利用丰富的环境变量和人口统计数据，将脑建模构建为多任务学习：通过标记脑-环境交互进行多任务预训练，并使用预训练的BEI伪标签进行半监督微调。

Result: 在性别预测、人类行为识别以及自闭症、帕金森病、阿尔茨海默病和精神分裂症的早期诊断等多种应用中评估，显示出促进神经影像临床应用的巨大潜力。

Conclusion: 该基础模型在神经影像应用中表现出色，有望促进当前神经影像在临床常规中的应用。

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

### [46] [ADPO: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18913)
*Wang Zixian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADPO是一个统一框架，扩展了DPO，引入软偏好概率、参考策略锚定和列表扩展，在噪声环境中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO假设硬二元标签和成对比较，在存在不确定性和噪声的实际场景中表现不佳。ADPO旨在通过软偏好、锚定机制和列表建模来解决这些问题。

Method: ADPO引入：(1)软偏好概率编码不确定性；(2)任意参考策略锚定通过组间平移不变性和隐式KL正则化稳定训练；(3)通过Plackett-Luce分布进行列表偏好建模。

Result: 在上下文赌博机中，锚定使WinMass比标准DPO提升38-63%，KDE平滑在重尾噪声下达到0.68 vs 0.32（相对增益112%）。在顺序强化学习中，锚定在噪声偏好下性能提升15-29%。

Conclusion: 建议在干净或中等噪声场景使用成对锚定Soft-DPO，在极端污染场景使用基于KDE的列表ADPO。该框架成功从单步设置扩展到多步设置。

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

Result: 研究比较了BERT、RoBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa模型在苹果硅MacBook设备与NVIDIA CUDA GPU上的推理延迟性能。

Conclusion: 结果突显了MLX在苹果生态系统内实现高效且更易访问的端侧机器学习应用的潜力。

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于人类反馈的强化学习(RLHF)或可验证奖励(RLVR)对不一致或错误奖励产生的噪声高度敏感，但此类噪声与广泛使用的基于群体的策略优化方法之间的相互作用尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 引入噪声鲁棒的群体相对策略优化(GRPO)和正确实现的GRPO(Dr.GRPO)框架，将奖励腐败显式建模为伯努利噪声，在估计奖励翻转概率后应用噪声校正来去偏学习信号。

Result: 在数学和代码任务上应用噪声校正后观察到一致的改进，在现实奖励模型条件下，数学任务准确率提升高达6.7个百分点，代码任务提升1.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 这项工作将监督学习中的标签噪声校正与现代RLHF连接起来，为嘈杂的现实世界部署提供了理论见解和实用算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 该框架为研究现象中所有时间尺度提供了有效的近似和解释，确保了宏观和微观动力学的准确捕获。

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a
significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to
initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning
methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first
leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,
to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both
macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-
and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely
available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct
multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches
ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the
framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale
phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete
observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time
scales present in the phenomena under study.

Motivation: 解决离线强化学习中策略熵急剧下降、优化不稳定甚至崩溃的问题，特别是在使用历史数据进行训练时

Method: 提出BAPO方法，基于熵裁剪规则动态调整裁剪边界，自适应平衡正负贡献，保持策略熵并稳定RL优化

Result: 在AIME 2024和2025基准测试中，7B模型超越SkyWork-OR1-7B等开源模型，32B模型在同等规模模型中达到SOTA，甚至超越o3-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking等专有系统

Conclusion: BAPO通过动态裁剪机制有效解决了离线RL中的优化不平衡问题，实现了快速、稳定且数据高效的训练

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

Method: 通过实验分析不同训练修改（如超参数调整、SGD变体切换）对多种泛化度量的影响，包括路径范数、谱范数、Frobenius范数、平坦度代理和确定性PAC-Bayes代理等。

Result: 发现许多泛化度量对微小训练修改高度敏感，例如学习率调整可以反转路径范数的学习曲线斜率。PAC-Bayes原点度量虽然对超参数调整较不敏感，但无法捕捉数据复杂度的差异。

Conclusion: 许多后验泛化度量存在脆弱性问题，开发者应明确审计新度量的脆弱性，以确保其可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural
networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such
measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In
this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --
those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training
modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a
measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter
changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants
can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization
measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For
instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,
and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.
However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across
learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based
marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in
data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is
not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as
path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic
PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that
developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

*Zhi Zhang,Yixian Shen,Congfeng Cao,Ekaterina Shutova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroAda是一种新的参数高效微调方法，通过识别重要参数并为其添加旁路连接，在保持高内存效率的同时实现细粒度模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法存在权衡：基于添加的方法（如LoRA）内存效率高但表示能力有限；选择性原位适应方法适应更精确但内存消耗大。需要平衡这种权衡。

Method: 首先识别网络中的重要参数（连接），然后为这些选定的参数引入旁路连接。在微调过程中，只更新旁路连接，保持原始模型参数冻结。

Result: 在23+个自然语言生成和理解任务上的实验结果表明，NeuroAda仅使用≤0.02%的可训练参数就达到了最先进的性能，同时将CUDA内存使用量减少了高达60%。

Conclusion: NeuroAda成功解决了PEFT方法中的权衡问题，实现了细粒度模型微调和高内存效率的平衡。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

Motivation: 传统非线性PDE求解器计算成本高，神经算子虽然推理速度快但分布外泛化能力差，需要解决这一关键问题。

Method: 使用可微分谱求解器作为教师模型监督学生神经算子，通过PGD风格主动采样在平滑性和能量约束下搜索最坏情况输入来扩展训练集。

Result: 在Burgers和Navier-Stokes系统上的实验表明，对抗蒸馏显著提高了分布外鲁棒性，同时保持了神经算子的低参数成本和快速推理优势。

Conclusion: 对抗蒸馏框架有效解决了神经算子的分布外泛化问题，为PDE求解提供了既高效又鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

Conclusion: 该系统克服了在线学习的冷启动问题，提高了计算效率，是个性化医疗的重要进展。

Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and
empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to
suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large
Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks
(CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to
provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach
utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured
datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient
data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification), deploys T-learners to forecast
patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates
prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by
effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of
existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that
our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000
rounds, exceeding other reference methods. This comprehensive system overcomes
cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational
effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine
adapted to specific patient characteristics.

Motivation: 研究动物和神经网络中观察到的类别感知现象，即类别学习会增强边界附近刺激的区分能力，从理论上解释这一现象的产生机制。

Method: 扩展理论框架到人工网络，分析最小化贝叶斯成本与最大化互信息的关系，引入Fisher信息矩阵衡量神经活动对投影空间变化的敏感性，并通过玩具模型和MNIST数据集进行数值验证。

Result: 发现最优学习使神经Fisher信息遵循类别特定的Fisher信息，其最大值通常位于类别边界附近而非正边界上，两个Fisher信息矩阵在学习后匹配并对齐类别边界。

Conclusion: 类别学习在决策边界附近诱导神经空间扩展，建立了贝叶斯成本与互信息的联系，并展示了与信息瓶颈方法的关联，提出了贝叶斯成本的偏差-方差分解。

Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close
to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was
also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on
classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we
show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient
learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We
show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies
maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural
activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an
underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual
information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)
building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is
based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural
activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural
Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the
sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an
expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the
properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors
give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We
find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,
the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we
numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices
match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate
our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance
decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型决策树变体——形状广义树（SGT），通过在每个内部节点应用可学习的轴对齐形状函数，实现非线性分割，同时保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统决策树依赖简单的轴对齐线性分割，需要深层复杂结构来捕捉非线性特征效应，这削弱了模型的可解释性。

Method: 提出了SGT框架，使用可学习的轴对齐形状函数进行非线性分割，并开发了ShapeCART算法来学习SGT。还扩展了双变量形状函数（S²GT）和多路树（SGT_K）。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SGT相比传统轴对齐线性树实现了更优的性能，同时减少了模型规模。

Conclusion: SGT在保持决策树可解释性的同时，通过非线性分割提高了性能并减少了模型复杂度，为可解释机器学习提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

TL;DR: POLAR是一种基于强化学习的联邦学习后门攻击方法，通过策略梯度优化选择关键层进行攻击，在保持隐蔽性的同时提高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后门关键层选择方法基于规则，没有考虑层间相互关系，导致攻击效果不佳且容易被先进防御机制检测到。

Method: 采用轻量级强化学习框架，使用伯努利采样动态学习攻击策略，通过策略梯度更新优化层选择，并引入正则化约束限制修改层数以保持隐蔽性。

Result: 在对抗六种最先进防御方法的实验中，POLAR比最新攻击方法性能提升高达40%。

Conclusion: POLAR证明了强化学习在解决后门关键层选择问题上的有效性，能够实现高攻击成功率的同时保持隐蔽性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%
against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过大规模实证研究发现，Maximal Update Parameterization (muP) 的学习率缩放规则仅在训练初期有效，而权重衰减才是实现跨宽度模型学习率转移的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何将小神经网络的最优学习率转移到大型网络，以解决超参数调优成本过高的问题。

Method: 进行大规模实证调查，分析muP假设在实际训练场景中的有效性，特别是比较muP与权重衰减在稳定内部表示更新动态方面的作用。

Result: 发现muP的假设仅在训练初期成立，权重衰减才是稳定跨宽度模型更新动态的主要机制，muP主要起到隐式学习率预热的作用。

Conclusion: 这些发现挑战了关于学习率转移的普遍信念，解释了为什么muP需要独立权重衰减变体才能成功转移，并建议可以用改进的预热调度来替代muP。

Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks
can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is
otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update
Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the
update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model
widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,
particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its
weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we
show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the
practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM
training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that
correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across
widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling
primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to
largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings
fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can
explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight
decay variant for successful transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课程学习已成为提升大语言模型推理能力的热门策略，但先前研究使用不同的难度指标和训练设置，导致对课程学习何时有效、哪种方向更好等基本问题缺乏统一认识。

Method: 构建统一的离线评估框架，将课程难度分解为五个互补维度：问题难度、模型惊奇度、置信度边际、预测不确定性和决策变异性，并在数学推理基准上对Llama3.1-8B、Mistral-7B和Gemma3-4B进行受控后训练实验。

Result: 发现：(i) 没有通用的主导课程策略，前向与反向课程学习的相对效果取决于模型能力和任务复杂度的共同作用；(ii) 即使在同一指标内，不同难度级别的样本根据任务需求产生不同的收益；(iii) 任务对齐的课程侧重于塑造模型的最终表示和泛化能力，而内部状态课程则调节置信度和不确定性等内部状态。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了通用课程策略的概念，为不同模型和任务场景提供了可操作的指导，某些指标表明优先处理决策不确定的样本可以进一步改善学习效果。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

TL;DR: MetaCluster是一个压缩Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks（KANs）参数的框架，通过元学习器将系数向量映射到低维流形，然后使用K-means聚类和共享质心替换每边向量，实现高达80倍的参数存储减少且不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs用每边向量替换标量权重提高了表达能力和精度，但导致参数和内存呈乘法增长，需要高效的压缩方法。

Method: 使用轻量级元学习器将低维嵌入映射到系数向量，使其位于低维流形上，然后进行K-means聚类，用共享质心替换每边向量，最后微调质心码本。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，MetaCluster实现了高达80倍的参数存储减少，且没有精度损失。

Conclusion: MetaCluster框架成功解决了KANs参数过多的问题，通过利用KAN参数的向量性质进行压缩，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了同伴影响力概率学习中的基本权衡，并提供了可调节的算法解决方案，在现实网络环境中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about
content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to
which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,
dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,
the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities
highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to
understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the
effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these
probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations
between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence
relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from
interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or
optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher
influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence
probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a
fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation
error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an
uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains
any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network
datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual
bandits that ignore this trade-off.

Motivation: 现有可控音乐生成方法通常需要重新训练模型或会产生可听伪影，因此需要一种能够在不影响生成质量的前提下实现精细控制的方法。

Method: 训练轻量级RFM探针发现MusicGen隐藏状态中的概念方向，然后在推理过程中将这些方向注入回模型，通过动态时间变化调度和多属性同时执行机制实现实时控制。

Result: 将目标音符生成准确率从0.23提升到0.82，同时文本提示保持度与未控制基线仅相差约0.02，实现了有效控制且对提示保真度影响最小。

Conclusion: MusicRFM在控制能力和生成质量之间取得了良好平衡，为音乐领域的RFM应用提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to
encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

Motivation: 传统Granger因果分析基于线性模型，难以检测非线性因果关系，且依赖因果充分性和已知干预目标两个关键假设。现实中时间序列数据存在潜在混杂变量和异质环境，难以区分干预环境和非干预环境。

Method: 提出不变Granger因果性(InvarGC)，利用跨环境异质性来减轻潜在混杂变量的影响，以边缘级粒度区分干预和非干预环境，从而恢复不变因果关系。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: InvarGC方法能够有效解决传统Granger因果分析的局限性，在存在潜在混杂和未知干预环境的情况下恢复不变因果结构。

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 这些结果证明了依赖合成数据的AI系统中存在关键漏洞，并强调需要能够应对潜在威胁的新安全协议。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

### [65] [Feature Space Adaptation for Robust Model Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19155)
*Peng Wang,Minghao Gu,Qiang Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种特征空间微调方法LoRFA和VeFA，通过在特征空间而非权重空间进行适配，缓解灾难性遗忘问题，在保持微调性能的同时提升模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型微调中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是当下游领域数据有限或与预训练分布差异较大时。现有参数高效微调方法在权重空间操作，可能导致模型过度专业化，覆盖预训练知识。

Method: 提出特征空间微调方法：LoRFA（低秩特征适配）和VeFA（基于向量的特征适配）。基于效应等价建模理论，通过轻量级特征级变换补偿下游潜伏变量的影响，保留预训练表示。

Result: 在图像分类、自然语言理解和生成任务上评估，与LoRA相比，特征空间适配在保持可比微调结果的同时，展现出持续更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 特征空间微调是缓解灾难性遗忘和提升模型泛化能力的有效方法，特别是在分布偏移场景下。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对线性部分监测问题的非随机对抗性算法，通过探索优化方法实现高效实现，获得了比先前理论更透明的遗憾界，在易游戏和难游戏中分别达到√T和T^{2/3}的遗憾率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性部分监测能够建模无限结果空间，同时在线性损失和观测上施加结构，这可以视为线性赌博机问题的推广，其中损失和反馈以灵活方式解耦。

Method: 采用探索优化方法的简单实例，适用于有限动作的非随机对抗性版本问题，该方法易于高效实现。

Conclusion: 该模型涵盖了新旧部分信息设置，在有趣案例中实现了对游戏结构的紧密依赖，展示了所获遗憾界的紧性。

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整合多样化数据对改善科学探索至关重要，该研究旨在建立能够准确分类小鼠在不同环境中行为的模型，支持复杂研究问题的解决。

Method: 使用开源Qwen2.5-VL模型，通过提示工程、上下文学习（ICL）和帧级预处理来提升性能，无需模型微调。

Result: 这些方法均能提升分类效果，组合使用时在所有行为类别（包括罕见行为如僵直和逃跑）上都获得了较高的F1分数。

Conclusion: 该模型将为研究小鼠行为的跨学科研究者提供支持，使他们能够整合跨多个时间点和环境的行为特征，构建全面的数据集。

Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving
scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a
vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对非共轭模型中的随机自然梯度变分推断(NGVI)进行了理论分析，提出了相对平滑性条件、改进的NGVI算法，并在特定条件下证明了快速全局收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然NGVI在实践中广泛使用且效果显著，但其理论基础在非共轭似然情况下仍然有限，特别是当变分损失变得非凸且难以分析时。

Method: 针对均值场参数化，首先推导了变分损失满足相对平滑性的充分条件；其次提出了包含非欧投影的改进NGVI算法；最后在额外结构假设下揭示了变分损失的隐藏凸性。

Result: 证明了改进NGVI算法的全局非渐近收敛到驻点，并在特定条件下建立了NGVI到全局最优的快速全局收敛性。

Conclusion: 这些结果为NGVI在挑战性推断设置中的几何性质和收敛行为提供了新的理论见解。

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

TL;DR: 多任务后训练中的梯度不平衡问题：某些任务产生显著更大的梯度，导致优化偏向这些任务，但大梯度并不一定带来更大的学习收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现多任务后训练中梯度大小不平衡的问题，大梯度任务主导优化过程，但这种现象缺乏合理性依据。

Method: 分析RL后训练中不同任务的梯度大小和学习收益关系，研究梯度不平衡的原因。

Result: 大梯度任务的学习收益可能低于小梯度任务，梯度不平衡不能通过训练奖励或优势值等典型统计量解释。

Conclusion: 需要谨慎处理数据集混合，未来应开发基于梯度级别的校正方法。

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中通信受限的问题，降低通信开销同时维持智能体间的协调。

Method: 采用去中心化actor-critic框架，每个智能体在信息交换前进行多次局部策略和值函数更新，值函数通过多层神经网络近似。

Result: 在马尔可夫采样下建立了有限时间收敛分析，达到ε-精确驻点的样本复杂度为O(ε⁻³)，通信复杂度为O(ε⁻¹τ⁻¹)，其中τ为局部训练步数。

Conclusion: 数值实验验证了理论发现，表明该方法在合作控制场景中有效平衡了通信效率和协调性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent
systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized
actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local
updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a
multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors.
This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden
while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time
convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to
attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of
local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the
neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative
control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information
flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still
suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph
information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that
energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize
that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to
identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we
propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves
active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that
dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the
over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite
diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active
diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique
characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the
graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art
GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN
significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node
distinctiveness.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的机器遗忘方法CUP，将机器遗忘重新定义为多目标优化问题，通过独特的梯度枢轴机制可控地导航整个帕累托前沿，解决了传统方法在遗忘效果和模型保真度之间的权衡问题。


<details>

Motivation: 传统机器遗忘方法作为单目标优化问题面临三个主要挑战：过度遗忘风险、缺乏细粒度控制、以及缺乏全面评估权衡的指标。需要一种能够精确控制遗忘过程的方法。

Method: 提出CUP算法，采用多目标优化框架，通过梯度枢轴机制可控地导航帕累托前沿。使用单一直观的超参数'遗忘强度'来精确选择所需的权衡点。

Result: 实验结果表明，CUP能够生成更优的帕累托最优解集，在各种视觉任务中持续优于现有方法。采用超体积指标评估算法生成解集的质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 将机器遗忘重新定义为多目标优化问题，并通过CUP算法的可控导航机制，有效解决了遗忘效果与模型保真度之间的权衡问题，提供了更精细的控制能力。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts
without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a
brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering
framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion
dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible
adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides
proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess
multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are
competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty
detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of
early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

Motivation: 在高风险决策中，可解释的强化学习策略至关重要，但在马尔可夫决策过程中优化决策树策略仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 将优化问题建模为混合整数线性规划，采用降维分支定界方法解耦MDP动态和树结构约束，实现高效并行搜索。

Conclusion: 该方法同时实现了可解释性和可扩展性，以比现有方法快一个数量级的速度提供高质量策略。

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as
a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a
reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from
tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This
significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster
than existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习虽然性能优异但缺乏可解释性，限制了对其策略行为的信任。现有的SILVER框架仅限于低维、二元动作领域。

Method: 首先从图像观察中提取紧凑特征表示，进行SHAP特征归因，然后使用RL引导标记生成行为一致的边界数据集，最后训练决策树和回归函数等替代模型来解释RL策略的决策结构。

Result: 在两个Atari环境中使用三种深度RL算法进行评估，并通过人类主体研究评估了可解释策略的清晰度和可信度。结果表明该方法在保持竞争性任务性能的同时，显著提高了透明度和人类对智能体行为的理解。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过将SILVER转变为可扩展且行为感知的框架，推进了可解释强化学习在高维多动作设置中解释深度RL智能体的能力。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks
interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER
framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based
regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We
propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER
to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL
policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method
first extracts compact feature representations from image observations,
performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to
generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as
decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to
interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on
two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject
study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable
policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance
while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent
behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a
scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in
high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

Conclusion: GraMixC作为一种即插即用模块，能够有效提取和利用多分辨率配置，显著提升各种下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

Method: 在三个层面进行干预：结构层面的边重加权、表示层面的MMD对齐、预测层面的Sinkhorn分布匹配

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，FnRGNN能够减少群体差异且不牺牲性能

Conclusion: 多层面策略能够在复杂图拓扑下确保鲁棒的公平性

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from structured data, yet
fairness in regression tasks remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly
target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully
address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a
fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that
applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting,
(ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level
normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level
strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities
without sacrificing performance. Code is available at

*Penghao Wang,Yuhao Zhou,Mengxuan Wu,Panpan Zhang,Zhangyang Wang,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CAB框架，通过注意力桥接和灵活的层间对齐，将Transformer教师模型的知识高效蒸馏到状态空间学生模型中，解决了结构异构模型间的知识迁移难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型虽然比Transformer更具可扩展性，但训练成本高且生态系统不成熟，且与Transformer的结构差异使得难以从预训练注意力模型中有效蒸馏知识。

Method: 提出跨架构蒸馏框架CAB，使用轻量级注意力桥接实现token级监督，并引入灵活的层间对齐策略来适应师生模型的结构差异。

Result: 在视觉和语言领域的广泛实验表明，该方法能持续提升状态空间模型性能，在有限训练数据下也优于标准和跨架构蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 注意力知识可以高效迁移到循环模型中，为构建更强大的SSM社区提供了快速利用Transformer专业知识的途径。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through
recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem
around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the
structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to
efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work,
we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel
data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention
knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike
conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output
level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and
flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability.
We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate
architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments
across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently
improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training
data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.
Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently
transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer
expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

TL;DR: 提出高斯蒸馏方法，通过深度潜变量因子模型将教师集成压缩为单一学生分布，解决了传统知识蒸馏在不确定性保持方面的不足


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度集成虽然能提供最先进的不确定性量化，但计算和内存需求大，难以部署到实际应用中。传统知识蒸馏在压缩模型时会减少不确定性

Method: 使用深度潜变量因子模型将教师集成视为随机过程的实现，通过期望最大化算法稳定估计均值和协方差函数，实现分布蒸馏

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，高斯蒸馏方法优于现有基线方法，在语言模型微调和分布偏移问题上表现良好

Conclusion: 高斯蒸馏是一种有效的分布蒸馏方法，能够将教师集成的不确定性信息成功压缩到学生模型中

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

TL;DR: 提出QiMeng-SALV方法，通过利用功能正确输出信号的代码片段来优化Verilog代码生成的强化学习训练，实现从模块级到信号级的细粒度优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在Verilog代码生成方面展现出潜力，但缺乏有意义的功能奖励阻碍了基于强化学习的偏好优化，难以生成功能正确的Verilog代码。

Method: 通过比较生成模块与参考模块的功能正确性来验证信号，使用抽象语法树识别信号感知代码片段，引入信号感知DPO在正确信号级代码段上进行优化。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM上达到最先进性能，7B参数模型匹配DeepSeek v3 671B模型的性能，显著优于在同一数据集上训练的开源模型CodeV。

Conclusion: QiMeng-SALV标志着Verilog代码生成从传统模块级优化向细粒度信号级优化的范式转变，解决了功能奖励不足的问题。

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising
opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for
automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders
the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog
code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading
open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at
https://github.com/zy1xxx/SALV.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜变量路径保留分布信息，解决了离散扩散模型采样时的信息崩溃问题，显著提升了文本生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在并行解码方面有优势，但采样时一旦进行类别采样，丰富的分布信息就会崩溃为one-hot向量，无法在步骤间传播，导致后续步骤信息受限。

Method: 引入Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜变量路径保留分布信息，结合自条件策略高效训练，构建Loopholing离散扩散模型(LDDMs)。

Result: 生成困惑度比先前基线降低高达61%，接近甚至超过自回归模型性能，生成文本更连贯，在Countdown和Game of 24等算术推理任务上表现更好。

Conclusion: Loopholing机制有效缓解了空闲步骤和振荡问题，为非自回归文本生成提供了可扩展的高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

Method: 使用深度学习和数据插补技术，采用数据平衡和特征选择方法，构建多模态集成模型，整合土地覆盖、NDVI等环境变量。

Result: 数据平衡使蛙类计数任务的MAE从189降至29；多模态集成模型在栖息地分类中达到84.9%准确率和0.90 AUC；特征选择识别出关键环境因素。

Conclusion: 多模态学习和数据预处理技术（如平衡和插补）能够显著提高生态预测模型的准确性，特别是在数据稀疏或不完整的情况下，有助于实现更精确和可扩展的生物多样性监测。

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

Conclusion: 该通用方案适应任何底层表示、聚类、校准方法和度量，为机器学习模型提供了同时优化判别和校准的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models are essential for decision-making and risk
assessment, requiring highly reliable predictions in terms of both
discrimination and calibration. While calibration often receives less
attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical
predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an
ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model
selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme
adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and
metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used
calibration methods.

Conclusion: Ring-linear模型系列通过混合注意力架构和高效算子库，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了长上下文推理的计算和I/O成本。

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文指出时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)的预测形式(点预测、分位数预测、参数预测或轨迹集成)决定了其实际应用价值，许多操作任务需要保留时间依赖性的轨迹集成预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TSFMs主要关注预测精度，但预测形式对实际应用价值同样重要。许多操作任务需要轨迹集成预测来保留时间依赖性，而现有模型大多只提供点预测或参数预测。

Method: 调查了近期TSFMs的预测形式，建立了不同预测类型之间的转换规则，证明了边际分布无法确定路径依赖事件概率，并提出了任务对齐的评估框架。

Result: 发现三分之二的TSFMs只产生点预测或参数预测，而许多操作任务需要轨迹集成预测。证明了从简单预测形式转换为轨迹集成需要额外假设时间依赖性。

Conclusion: 预测类型而不仅仅是精度决定了实际效用。需要根据具体任务选择适当的预测形式，轨迹集成预测对于许多操作任务至关重要。

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

Motivation: 大多数机器学习模型对对抗样本都很脆弱，这引发了安全担忧。传统对抗样本是在原始样本附近微小修改导致错误输出，而本文研究相反情况：显著不同但输出相同的样本。

Result: 这些方法生成的对抗样本可用于在某些情况下攻击机器学习系统。研究还发现对抗样本不仅分布在数据集样本的邻域内，而是广泛分布在样本空间中。

Conclusion: 对抗样本的分布范围比传统认知更广泛，不仅局限于原始样本附近，这为机器学习安全研究提供了新的视角和挑战。

Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which
poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by
applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the
dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original
example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite
manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result
in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such
adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign
method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM),
along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods
could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain
occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not
merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset;
instead, they are distributed extensively in the sample space.

Conclusion: BBMDP提供了一个原则性的MDP公式框架，能够有效学习分支定界中的最优变量选择策略，显著提升求解性能。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to
address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often
solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of
B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions.
Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence
theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla
MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad
range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics.
Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching
agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP
benchmarks.

Conclusion: Scalable LinUCB算法通过低秩近似显著降低了LinUCB的计算和存储复杂度，为大规模推荐系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

Abstract: Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in
GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to
traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking
systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive
training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise
model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in
high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer,
a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a
hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient
differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and
gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while
ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value
decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the
privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark
datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning
accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical

Motivation: 许多系统会随时间老化或退化，但传感器数据中可能没有直接的'年龄'信息。需要从现有传感器数据中发现能代表系统老化过程的潜在代理特征。

Method: 使用精心定义的语法生成候选公式，通过优化公式的单调性（基于Spearman秩相关系数）来发现能组合多个传感器的潜在特征。

often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.

TL;DR: ADAligner是一个动态、质量感知的图-文本对齐框架，通过实时评估监督质量来动态调整多对多和一对一对齐策略，解决了现有方法在噪声监督下的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP风格的图-文本对齐方法存在两个关键限制：假设严格的节点-文本一对一对应关系，忽略了现实图中固有的多对多关系；依赖静态对齐目标无法适应不同的数据质量，在噪声监督下表现脆弱。

Method: ADAligner框架动态估计批次级别的对齐可靠性，并根据监督质量自适应调整优化策略：在监督干净时促进软性的子图级多对多对齐，在噪声环境下通过动态过滤低置信度对来强调可靠的一对一对齐。

Result: 在九个不同的TAG数据集上的综合实验表明，ADAligner在零样本/少样本节点分类、链接预测和跨模态检索任务上持续优于先前的图-文本对齐方法，在噪声监督下保持强鲁棒性，预训练速度比多模态基线快约2-3倍。

Conclusion: ADAligner为现实网络环境中的图-文本表示学习建立了可扩展且可靠的基础，通过动态质量感知机制解决了图-文本对齐中的核心困境。

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CPSVD方法，通过智能分割参数矩阵来改进基于SVD的LLM压缩，直接保留高分解误差的列，仅对低分解误差的列应用SVD，并自适应分配非均匀压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD方法将整个参数矩阵统一处理，忽略了不同矩阵部分的SVD近似误差差异，导致压缩效果不佳。需要更智能的矩阵分割策略来优化压缩性能。

Method: CPSVD方法：1）识别并直接保留高分解误差的矩阵列；2）仅对低分解误差的列应用SVD；3）自适应分配非均匀压缩率给LLM中的不同模块；4）在保持层间压缩比的同时优化压缩性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，CPSVD在基于SVD的LLM压缩方法中表现最优，在零样本任务上实现了更低的困惑度和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: CPSVD通过智能矩阵分割和自适应压缩率分配，显著提升了SVD-based LLM压缩的性能，为大型语言模型的高效压缩提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

TL;DR: 提出自适应秩分配(ARA)方法解决LLM压缩中SVD的秩分配问题，通过专用掩码设计和额外损失函数实现全局最优解，在LLaMA2-7B模型上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法在确定不同线性模块的秩分配时存在局限：启发式算法搜索空间受限，掩码训练难以有效捕捉奇异值谱与可训练参数的关系，且忽略了增益函数在压缩比为1时的非光滑特性，导致训练陷入局部最优。

Method: ARA方法包含：(1)专用掩码设计，实现保留秩与可训练参数之间的高效映射和更新；(2)额外损失函数，引导参数选择朝向全局最优解。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B模型80%压缩比下，ARA将WikiText2上的困惑度从8.38降至6.42，零样本任务平均准确率相比均匀压缩提升9.72个百分点。

Conclusion: ARA方法在基于SVD的LLM压缩中有效解决了秩分配问题，实现了状态最优性能。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络训练中的频谱偏差问题，即神经网络倾向于先学习低频特征，这在物理信息神经网络中尤为突出

Method: 使用随机傅里叶特征增强潜在空间，创建两阶段训练：估计特征空间基函数和执行回归确定增强基函数系数

Result: 在线性模型下证明迭代训练收敛，经验验证随机傅里叶特征增强网络表达能力，在经典基准问题上优于现有算法

Conclusion: IFeF-PINN通过傅里叶特征增强有效克服频谱偏差，显著提升高频PDE的逼近精度

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency
features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose
IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced
features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency
components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training
problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression
to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an
underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we
prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically
establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the
network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through
extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior
performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the
improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法通常牺牲模型性能、依赖静态校正策略、难以处理数据稀疏性，且对敏感属性的利用不够优化。

Method: 集成偏置检测器与条件LoRA，使用对比损失函数训练LoRA模块以减少跨敏感群体的类内表示差异，支持完整、部分或缺失敏感属性标签的场景。

Result: 理论分析表明在适度TPR/FPR条件下，FairNet能提升最差群体性能而不损害整体性能，甚至可能带来轻微性能提升。多基准测试验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: FairNet提供了一种灵活有效的动态公平性校正方法，能够在各种敏感属性标签场景下实现公平性与性能的平衡。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型遗忘方法依赖梯度上升来降低特定目标响应的概率，但这会导致概率质量被重新分配到高似然区域，形成语义相关的重述，造成虚假遗忘。

Method: 提出了引导框架(BS)，将挤压效应与模型自身的高置信度生成（模型信念）联系起来。通过同时抑制目标响应和模型信念，BS-T抑制高概率token，BS-S移除整个高置信度生成，实现更彻底的遗忘。

Result: 在多个基准测试和不同模型家族上的广泛实验证实了该方法的有效性，能够实现更彻底的遗忘同时保持模型效用。

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接针对挤压效应，结合模型信念进行遗忘，解决了传统方法中虚假遗忘的问题，为语言模型安全遗忘提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

Result: 在1D随机回归、图像修复和分类等少样本学习任务中，NVDPs表现出优于其他元学习方法的性能。

Conclusion: NVDPs能够稳健地近似任务特定的dropout率，处理广泛的功能模糊性和不确定性，在少样本学习中具有优异表现。

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

Method: 在不同数据集上验证表示相似性和预测行为，分析分类层对预测差异的影响，并通过重新训练分类器来改善预测普适性。

Result: 在特定设置下验证了高表示相似性，但结果在不同数据集间不一致；预测行为不会随鲁棒性增强而收敛；预测差异主要来自分类层；重新训练分类器可以改善预测普适性。

Conclusion: 神经网络在特定设置下具有部分普适性，但不存在严格的普适性概念。

Abstract: The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests
that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.
We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main
claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not
consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior
does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find
that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that
more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of
the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of
neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict
universality.

Motivation: 标准DPO方法面临可扩展性瓶颈：训练对的数量随标记序列数量呈二次方增长，导致即使对于中等规模的数据集也会产生过长的训练时间。

Method: 使用序列空间聚类来修剪冗余训练对，同时保留训练信号；采用基于分组的方法来分摊似然计算。

Result: 在三个蛋白质工程任务中，g-DPO在保持与标准DPO在硅片和体外性能统计上无差异的同时，收敛速度提高了1.8到3.7倍。

Conclusion: g-DPO框架有效解决了DPO的可扩展性问题，随着数据集规模的增大，预期会获得更大的加速收益。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning
protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a
scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

Conclusion: ELUTQ框架通过HLQ格式有效解决了边缘设备上LLM部署的内存和延迟瓶颈，实现了高效的量化推理。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出多模型一致性方法，通过整合来自不同训练数据、训练方案和架构的多个LLM的响应，显著提升幻觉检测和缓解能力，同时降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单模型一致性方法在LLM幻觉检测和缓解方面已取得先进成果，但仍有局限性。通过整合多个不同LLM的响应，可以进一步改进幻觉检测和缓解能力。

Method: 扩展单模型一致性方法，将来自多个具有不同训练数据、训练方案和模型架构的LLM的响应进行组合，形成联盟一致性方法。

Result: 与单模型一致性方法相比，联盟一致性方法在幻觉检测和缓解能力方面取得显著提升，同时往往能降低推理成本。

Conclusion: 多模型联盟一致性方法能有效提升LLM幻觉检测和缓解性能，并在降低成本方面具有优势，为实际部署提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于原型的稀疏反事实解释框架，专门针对12导联心电图分类模型，通过SHAP阈值识别关键信号段、DTW和聚类提取原型，生成仅修改78%原始信号的反事实解释，在保持81.3%有效性的同时实现43%的时间稳定性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决最先进模型在时间序列数据上的可解释性挑战，特别是在医疗领域如心电图分类中，需要提供可操作且可解释的洞察。

Method: 使用SHAP阈值识别关键信号段并转换为区间规则，采用动态时间规整和中心聚类提取代表性原型，将原型与查询R峰对齐以确保与待解释样本的一致性。

Result: 生成的反事实解释仅修改78%原始信号，在所有类别中保持81.3%的有效性，时间稳定性提升43%，心肌梗死类别的有效性达98.9%，但肥厚检测面临挑战（13.2%）。

Conclusion: 该方法支持近实时生成临床有效的反事实解释，为交互式解释平台奠定基础，确立了基于生理感知的反事实解释设计原则，并为临床部署的用户控制解释接口指明了路径。

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Bi-level Decision-Focused Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL)方法，解决在线平台营销中的预测-决策错位和偏差-方差困境，通过双层优化框架联合利用观察数据和实验数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统两阶段方法存在预测-决策错位问题，ML模型只关注预测精度而不考虑下游优化目标；同时面临偏差-方差困境，观察数据有偏差而实验数据稀缺且成本高。

Method: 开发基于实验数据的无偏OR决策质量估计器，通过代理损失函数连接离散优化梯度；建立双层优化框架，通过隐式微分联合利用观察和实验数据。

Result: 在公开基准、工业营销数据集和大规模在线A/B测试中表现出显著改进，已在美团平台部署应用。

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL能有效校正观察数据的学习方向，实现最优偏差-方差权衡，在营销资源分配问题上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化方法存在显著的单步偏差，容易收敛到局部最优，在复杂或高维任务中表现不佳，而黑盒优化在科学工程领域已取得成功

Method: 集成高斯过程提供局部指导，能量基模型捕获全局结构信息，将每次贝叶斯优化迭代定义为马尔可夫决策过程，使用近端策略优化进行自适应多步前瞻

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中进行广泛实验，证实REBMBO具有优越性能，不同高斯过程配置下的分析进一步突显其适应性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: REBMBO通过动态调整探索深度和方向，有效克服了传统贝叶斯优化方法的局限性

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations
further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

Result: 在综合控制套件上的基准测试显示，MED-LQ在各种场景下实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: MED-LQ展示了在大型马尔可夫决策过程中更广泛应用潜力，为未知动力学的线性系统控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive
control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in
large-scale MDPs.

Motivation: AI方法在药物发现中的应用受到公共数据集规模和多样性限制，联邦学习能整合私有数据但难以进行数据多样性分析等任务。

Method: 使用三种联邦聚类方法（Fed-kMeans、Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans、Fed-LSH）在八个分子数据集上进行基准测试，并引入SF-ICF化学信息评估指标。

Result: 大规模基准测试结合可解释性分析表明，在分子数据的联邦多样性分析中，通过化学信息指标和客户端可解释性分析融入领域知识的重要性。

Conclusion: 联邦聚类方法能够有效表示分布式分子数据，但需要结合领域知识和化学信息指标来获得更好的分析结果。

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

Motivation: 尽管机器学习在COVID-19预测中显示出价值，但在地方性疾病预测方面仍探索不足，需要开发不依赖实时监测数据的预测方法。

Method: 基于XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM的集成模型，结合高分辨率特征学习和长程时间依赖捕捉机制，通过自回归模块训练气候控制的滞后关系，使用随机推理返回概率区间。

Conclusion: 该框架的效率、性能和不确定性感知设计使其成为可部署的早期预警工具，特别适用于气候压力加剧和监测资源受限的情况。

Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets
enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular
or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and
uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid
escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

TL;DR: DiffEvac是一种基于生成模型的建筑疏散模拟新方法，通过扩散模型学习疏散模式，显著提高模拟效率，将模拟时间缩短至2分钟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疏散模拟依赖精细建模和大量参数，难以在早期设计阶段快速迭代。需要一种更高效的疏散模拟方法来支持快速设计迭代。

Method: 建立399个不同功能布局和对应疏散热力图的数据集；提出解耦特征表示方法嵌入物理特征；基于图像提示的扩散模型学习疏散模式。

Result: 相比现有条件GAN方法，DiffEvac在SSIM指标上提升37.6%，PSNR提升142%，速度提升16倍，模拟时间缩短至2分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了建模负担，支持大规模假设探索，并能与多目标设计工具耦合，为智能建筑设计中的安全优化提供新思路。

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

Abstract: This paper argues that the method of least squares has significant
unfulfilled potential in modern machine learning, far beyond merely being a
tool for fitting linear models. To release its potential, we derive custom
gradients that transform the solver into a differentiable operator, like a
neural network layer, enabling many diverse applications. Empirically, we
demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million
parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based
generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next
iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them
widely accessible to machine learning practitioners.

Motivation: 现有的LoRA变体缺乏明确区分任务相关信息与残差信息的机制，这限制了其在低秩子空间中的下游性能。

Method: 提出因子化变分自编码器LoRA（FVAE-LoRA），利用VAE学习两个不同的潜在空间，并通过新的证据下界公式明确促进潜在空间之间的因子化。

Result: 在文本、音频和图像任务上的广泛实验表明，FVAE-LoRA始终优于标准LoRA。虚假相关性评估证实FVAE-LoRA能更好地隔离任务相关信号，在分布偏移下具有更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FVAE-LoRA通过明确分离任务相关特征和残差信息，显著提升了LoRA方法的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/idiap/FVAE-LoRA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时变环境中估计异质处理效应时，观察到的处理序列概率随预测时间跨度呈指数下降，导致严重的数据重叠问题，现有方法在重叠不足时估计方差会爆炸性增长。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的Neyman正交总体风险函数，最小化重叠加权的oracle风险，创建了重叠加权正交元学习器，该方法是完全模型无关的。

Conclusion: 提出的重叠加权正交元学习器具有Neyman正交性，对干扰函数错误设定具有鲁棒性，能够有效解决时变环境中处理序列重叠不足的问题。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

Motivation: 传统策略学习算法在预测不确定时仍强制决策，这在高风险场景中很危险。需要允许策略在不确定时弃权，选择安全的默认选项。

Method: 提出两阶段学习器：首先识别一组近似最优策略，然后基于它们的分歧构建弃权规则。使用双重稳健目标处理未知倾向得分情况。

Result: 当倾向得分已知时获得O(1/n)型快速遗憾保证，扩展到未知倾向得分情况。弃权机制还能改善边界条件下的性能保证，连接分布鲁棒策略学习，支持安全策略改进。

Conclusion: 弃权是策略学习中的多功能工具，可在不确定时提供安全机制，改善性能保证，并支持鲁棒和安全的策略学习。

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

Abstract: Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly
important as models grow larger while deployment environments impose strict
resource constraints. We propose TraDy, a novel transfer learning scheme
leveraging two key insights: layer importance for updates is
architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, while dynamic stochastic
channel selection provides superior gradient approximation compared to static
approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that
stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict
memory constraints, achieving up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight
derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs for weight derivative

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的推测解码使用单一草稿模型，但在实践中存在多种可能的草稿模型选择，从快速但不准确到慢速但更可靠。需要一种方法来充分利用这些不同草稿模型的优势。

Method: HSD将草稿模型堆叠成层次结构，每个模型提出token，下一个更大的模型在单次前向传播中验证它们，最终由目标模型验证token。算法可以在多项式时间内选择延迟最优的层次结构。

Result: 实验表明HSD相比最佳单草稿基线可获得高达1.2倍的加速，证明了该算法在减少生成延迟方面的实用性。

Conclusion: 分层推测解码通过利用多个草稿模型的层次结构，有效地减少了Transformer语言模型的推理延迟，超越了以往的技术。

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

### [121] [SEMPO: Lightweight Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19710)
*Hui He,Kun Yi,Yuanchi Ma,Qi Zhang,Zhendong Niu,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEMPO是一个轻量级时间序列基础模型，通过能量感知频谱分解和混合提示Transformer，在减少预训练数据规模和模型大小的同时，实现了强大的泛化预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型需要大规模预训练和庞大网络架构，难以在资源受限环境中部署。需要在多功能性和可负担性之间找到平衡。

Method: 1) 能量感知频谱分解模块：同时建模高能量和低能量频率信号；2) 混合提示Transformer：通过数据集特定提示学习异构时序模式，自适应路由时间序列令牌到基于提示的专家。

Result: 在包含16个数据集的2个大规模基准测试中，SEMPO在零样本和少样本预测场景下均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SEMPO显著减少了预训练数据规模和模型大小，同时实现了强大的泛化能力，为资源受限环境下的时间序列预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available
at https://github.com/mala-lab/SEMPO.

*Mahmoud Ibrahim,Bart Elen,Chang Sun,Gökhan Ertaylan,Michel Dumontier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Enhanced TimeAutoDiff框架，利用合成ICU时间序列数据进行模型训练和可信评估，显著缩小真实-合成数据评估差距，并在细粒度人口亚组中提升评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗AI中模型评估的隐私保护和可信度问题，特别是在ICU环境中需要保护敏感电子健康记录的同时进行细粒度性能分析。

Method: 基于先前的扩散和VAE生成器，引入Enhanced TimeAutoDiff，在潜在扩散目标中增加了分布对齐惩罚项。

Result: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff将真实-合成评估差距减少了70%以上，在32个交叉亚组中，大型合成队列将亚组级AUROC估计误差降低了50%，并在72-84%的亚组中优于小型真实测试集。

Conclusion: 这项工作为重症监护中可信、细粒度的模型评估提供了实用的隐私保护路线图，能够在保护敏感EHR数据的同时实现跨多样化患者群体的稳健可靠性能分析。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文建立了在线最小二乘SGD的线性泛函的非渐近Berry-Esseen界，在增长维度机制下提供高斯中心极限定理，显著扩展了先前工作的维度范围并提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中部署SGD需要严格量化其固有不确定性，现有高维推断方法计算成本高且维度扩展受限。

Method: 提出基于在线SGD的程序，在增长维度机制下建立非渐近Berry-Esseen界，并开发在线方差估计器。

Result: SGD迭代在迭代次数t ≳ d^(1+δ)时满足CLT，运行时间为O(td)，内存需求为O(d)，优于现有方法的O(td² + d³)。

Conclusion: 该研究为SGD迭代在接近最优的维度扩展机制下构建置信区间提供了首个完全在线和数据驱动的框架。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在物种分布建模中受限于数据的空间偏差问题，需要更有效地结合局部观测与生态模式。

Method: 从贝叶斯视角重新审视深度SDMs，提出BATIS框架，通过迭代更新先验预测，并采用多种不确定性量化方法处理偶然性和认知不确定性。

Result: 在包含eBird公民科学观测的新数据集上测试表明，贝叶斯深度学习方法能显著提高数据稀缺区域的模型可靠性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯深度学习可以大大提升物种分布模型在数据稀缺位置的可靠性，有助于生态理解和保护工作。

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

TL;DR: 本文解释了Transformer为何难以学习通用算法而依赖启发式方法。通过图连通性问题，理论证明L层Transformer能解决直径不超过3^L的图，实现类似邻接矩阵幂运算的算法。训练动态分析表明，训练数据是否在模型容量内决定了学习结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型经常无法学习通用算法，而是依赖脆弱的启发式方法。本文旨在从理论和实验上解释这一现象，特别以图连通性问题作为测试平台。

Method: 使用简化的解耦Transformer架构，理论分析其计算能力边界。通过训练动态分析，研究模型在不同容量训练数据下的学习行为。

Result: 理论证明L层模型能解决直径不超过3^L的图。实验表明：当训练数据在模型容量内时，Transformer学习正确算法；超出容量时则学习基于节点度的简单启发式方法。

Conclusion: 限制训练数据在模型容量范围内，可以使标准和解耦Transformer学习精确算法而非启发式方法，这为改进Transformer的算法学习能力提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

TL;DR: CONFEX是一种基于共形预测和混合整数线性规划的不确定性感知反事实解释方法，通过局部覆盖保证生成可靠的反事实解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法往往忽视预测不确定性，缺乏将不确定性纳入解释的正式机制，导致解释可能不可靠或误导。

Method: 提出CONFEX方法，结合共形预测和混合整数线性规划，通过离线树基分区实现高效的MILP编码，生成具有局部覆盖保证的不确定性感知反事实解释。

Result: 在多个基准测试和指标上评估CONFEX，证明该方法能产生稳健且合理的解释。

Conclusion: CONFEX为反事实解释提供了预测不确定性和最优性的严格保证，增强了反事实解释的可靠性。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

Motivation: 现有最先进的成员推理攻击需要训练大量计算昂贵的参考模型，限制了实用性。本文旨在开发一种无需参考模型即可准确评估模型脆弱性的方法。

Method: 利用训练和测试分布的不对称性和重尾特性，通过高损失区域异常值的缺失来预测模型脆弱性。使用简单的损失攻击的真负率来估计模型级脆弱性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效且高效地评估模型对成员推理攻击的脆弱性，无需训练参考模型，为隐私风险评估提供了实用的工具。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有稀疏微调技术的效果依赖于最优参数选择，需要一种能同时考虑任务相关性和预训练知识保护的方法。

Method: GaLLoP选择梯度幅度最大且预训练幅度最小的参数进行微调，优先考虑高度任务相关但最小化预训练知识干扰的参数。

Result: 在LLaMA3 8B和Gemma 2B上的实验表明，GaLLoP在分布内和分布外性能上均优于或匹配LoRA、DoRA和SAFT等主流参数高效微调技术。

Conclusion: GaLLoP能缓解灾难性遗忘和任务数据记忆问题，稳定性能表现，并在大多数随机种子下实现鲁棒泛化。

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法依赖IID数据假设，处理环境差异的泛化技术需要环境标签，但实际中由于数据采集挑战、隐私问题和环境变异性，环境标签往往不可用。

Method: 提出DynaInfer方法，通过分析固定神经网络在每轮训练中的预测误差来推断环境规范，直接从数据中实现环境分配。

Result: 实验表明DynaInfer优于现有环境分配技术，能快速收敛到真实标签，甚至在环境标签可用时也能实现更优性能。

Conclusion: DynaInfer提供了一种有效的环境推断方法，解决了环境标签不可用的问题，在各种动态系统中表现出色。

Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing
complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving
the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental
differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on
environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data
acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability,
particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In
response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment
specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within
each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We
prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in
unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across
diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing
environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even
achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

TL;DR: 该论文研究如何证明Bob使用的语言模型是基于Alice的开源模型训练而来，通过测试Bob模型或文本与Alice训练数据顺序的相关性来进行独立性检验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当Alice训练了一个开源权重语言模型，而Bob使用其衍生模型生成文本时，Alice需要一种方法来证明Bob确实使用了她的模型。这涉及到模型溯源和知识产权保护的问题。

Method: 1. 查询设置：通过提示直接估计Bob模型对Alice训练示例和顺序的似然度；2. 观察设置：基于文本重叠度估计或通过重新训练模型版本来检测相关性。

Result: 在查询设置中，对40多个Pythia和OLMo微调模型进行测试，除6个案例外，p值均达到1e-8级别。在观察设置中，第二种方法仅需几百个token就能可靠区分Bob的文本，而第一种方法需要数十万个token。

Conclusion: 通过训练数据顺序相关性测试，可以有效证明衍生模型与原始模型的依赖关系，为模型溯源提供了统计上可量化的证据。

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

TL;DR: 本文首次理论证明了简化Transformer架构可以通过梯度下降训练成为近乎最优的元学习器，在线性分类设置中仅需少量上下文示例就能适应新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer是否能在不进行额外训练的情况下，仅通过少量上下文示例作为元学习器适应新任务，填补现有理论分析在正式元学习设置中的空白。

Method: 使用简化Transformer架构，在类条件高斯混合模型任务族上进行梯度下降训练，每个任务的均值向量位于共享的k维子空间中。

Result: 训练后，Transformer仅需O(k/R^4)个上下文示例就能泛化到新任务，性能接近知道共享子空间的最优学习器，显著优于仅依赖上下文数据的学习器（需要Ω(d/R^4)示例）。

Conclusion: Transformer可以作为高效的元学习器，其训练任务数量和每任务示例数量与环境维度d无关，证明了其在元学习中的理论优势。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练的计算需求加剧了高容量司法管辖区与全球南方国家之间的结构性不对称，需要研究在资源受限条件下建立AI能力的可行性。

Method: 采用双轴设计，变化加速器类型（NVIDIA H100 vs A100）和训练时长（90天 vs 150天），估算10万亿token模型训练的计算需求、能耗、资本支出和监管兼容性。

Result: 所有配置都低于出口管制和电力基础设施阈值，但财政可行性取决于硬件效率：H100方案总成本8-14百万美元，A100方案需要19-32百万美元。

Conclusion: 延长训练时间应作为缓解硬件约束的政策杠杆，使中等收入国家能够建立可持续且战略上足够的AI能力，生产可用、可审计且本地对齐的模型。

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过预测未来像素帧来构建世界模型，但像素重建目标与规划目标不一致，强像素重建不一定对应好的规划决策。

Method: 将世界建模视为视觉问答问题，使用视觉语言模型作为语义世界模型，通过监督微调在图像-动作-文本数据上训练，预测任务相关的未来语义信息。

Result: 该方法在开放端机器人任务上实现了策略改进，相比基于重建的动作条件世界模型范式，获得了显著更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 语义世界模型通过预测任务相关语义信息而非像素，能更有效地支持机器人规划决策，并继承预训练视觉语言模型的泛化和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了X-Ego-CS数据集和CECL方法，用于从第一人称视角研究多智能体决策和团队战术学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解研究大多依赖第三人称视角，忽略了同步、自我中心的多智能体学习特性。

Method: 构建X-Ego-CS数据集，包含同步的第一人称视角视频流；提出CECL方法，通过对比学习对齐队友的自我中心视觉流。

Result: 在队友-对手位置预测任务中，CECL有效提升了从单一第一人称视角推断队友和对手位置的能力。

Conclusion: 为电子竞技中的跨自我中心多智能体基准测试奠定了基础，将游戏理解定位为多智能体建模和战术学习的测试平台。

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

*Ali Sadeghkhani,Brandon Bennett,Masoud Babaei,Arash Rabbani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多条件生成对抗网络(cGAN)框架，能够生成具有精确控制属性的代表性孔隙尺度图像，解决了地下表征中的代表性和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取真正代表整体地层属性的孔隙尺度图像是一个基本挑战，因为自然空间异质性导致提取的子图像与岩心测量值显著偏离，且物理样本仅在稀疏井位可用。

Method: 使用多条件生成对抗网络(cGAN)框架，在碳酸盐岩地层的四个深度薄片样本上训练，同时以孔隙度值和深度参数为条件，捕捉通用孔隙网络原理和深度特定地质特征。

Result: 模型在所有地层中实现了优异的孔隙度控制(R^2=0.95)，平均绝对误差为0.0099-0.0197。生成的图像显示出卓越的代表性，双约束误差为1.9-11.3%，而随机提取的真实子图像误差为36.4-578%。

Conclusion: 该能力为地下表征提供了变革性工具，特别适用于碳储存、地热能源和地下水管理应用，其中了解孔隙空间的代表性形态对于实施数字岩石物理至关重要。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARES是一个轻量级预处理模块，通过预测图像-查询对的最小足够分辨率来减少视觉语言模型的计算开销，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型通常以原生或高分辨率处理图像，导致视觉令牌占总令牌的97-99%，造成高计算成本和延迟，即使低分辨率图像就足够。

Method: 使用紧凑VLM（350M）提取特征并预测目标预训练VLM响应收敛到峰值能力时的最小分辨率，支持离散分类训练和连续分辨率插值推理。

Result: 在五个多模态基准测试中，CARES在保持任务性能的同时将计算量减少高达80%。

Conclusion: CARES通过智能分辨率选择有效平衡了视觉语言模型的性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

Conclusion: 该框架在多种地球观测应用中验证了其在单模态推理场景下的有效性，为多模态协同学习提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义分割中的不确定性估计相比标准图像分类面临独特挑战，需要可扩展的逐像素估计方法。现有研究多集中于场景理解或医学影像，缺乏针对遥感应用的专门评估。

Method: 在两个遥感数据集（PASTIS和ForTy）上进行实验，评估包括随机分割网络和集成方法在内的多种模型，结合不同神经网络架构和不确定性度量指标。

Result: 通过广泛评估，测试了不确定性度量在识别预测错误和噪声污染输入图像区域方面的能力，发现不同方法在不同数据集上的表现差异。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果提出了实用建议，为遥感应用中语义分割不确定性估计提供了指导。

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在文本引导图像编辑方面取得显著进展，但研究社区缺乏基于真实图像的大规模、高质量、开放可访问数据集，限制了进一步研究。

Method: 利用Nano-Banana从OpenImages的真实照片生成多样化编辑对，采用细粒度图像编辑分类法确保全面覆盖编辑类型，通过MLLM质量评分和精心策划保持内容保存和指令忠实度。

Result: 构建了包含40万张图像的Pico-Banana-400K数据集，包含三个专业子集：7.2万示例的多轮编辑集合、5.6万示例的偏好子集，以及长短编辑指令配对集合。

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K为训练和基准测试下一代文本引导图像编辑模型提供了大规模、高质量且任务丰富的资源基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对具有基数约束的r-可分解超模函数最大化问题的多项式时间近似算法，并扩展到连通性约束版本，显著改进了稠密连通k-子图问题的近似比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究具有基数约束的超模函数最大化问题，特别是针对r-可分解的超模函数，这类函数在实际应用中广泛存在，如网络设计、数据挖掘等领域。

Method: 提出了不依赖分解先验知识的O(n^{(r-1)/2})-近似算法，对于已知分解的情况，进一步考虑连通性约束，设计了相应的近似算法。

Result: 算法在多项式时间内实现了O(n^{(r-1)/2})的近似比，对于稠密连通k-子图问题，将近似比从O(n^{2/3})改进到O(n^{1/2})。

Conclusion: 本文为r-可分解超模函数的最大化问题提供了有效的近似算法，特别是在连通性约束下显著提升了稠密连通k-子图问题的近似性能。

Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite set of $n$ elements, $f: 2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ be
a nonnegative monotone supermodular function, and $k$ be a positive integer no
greater than $n$. This paper addresses the problem of maximizing $f(S)$ over
all subsets $S \subseteq V$ subject to the cardinality constraint $|S| = k$ or
$|S|\le k$.
  Let $r$ be a constant integer. The function $f$ is assumed to be {\em
$r$-decomposable}, meaning there exist $m\,(\ge1)$ subsets $V_1, \dots, V_m$ of
$V$, each with a cardinality at most $r$, and a corresponding set of
nonnegative supermodular functions $f_i : 2^{V_i} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$,
$i=1,\ldots,m$ such that $f(S) =\sum_{i=1}^m f_i(S \cap V_i)$ holds for each $S
\subseteq V$. Given $r$ as an input, we present a polynomial-time
$O(n^{(r-1)/2})$-approximation algorithm for this maximization problem, which
does not require prior knowledge of the specific decomposition.
  When the decomposition $(V_i,f_i)_{i=1}^m$ is known, an additional
connectivity requirement is introduced to the problem. Let $G$ be the graph
with vertex set $V$ and edge set $\cup_{i=1}^m \{uv:u,v\in V_i,u\neq v\}$. The
cardinality constrained solution set $S$ is required to induce a connected
subgraph in $G$. This model generalizes the well-known problem of finding the
densest connected $k$-subgraph. We propose a polynomial time
$O(n^{(r-1)/2})$-approximation algorithm for this generalization. Notably, this
algorithm gives an $O(n^{1/2})$-approximation for the densest connected
$k$-subgraph problem, improving upon the previous best-known approximation
ratio of $O(n^{2/3})$.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend the context of nonmonotone descent methods
to the class of nonsmooth and nonconvex functions called upper-$\mathcal{C}^2$,
which satisfy a nonsmooth and local version of the descent lemma. Under this
assumption, we propose a general subgradient method that performs a nonmonotone
linesearch, and we prove subsequential convergence to a stationary point of the
optimization problem. Our approach allows us to cover the setting of various
subgradient algorithms, including Newton and quasi-Newton methods. In addition,
we propose a specification of the general scheme, named Self-adaptive
Nonmonotone Subgradient Method (SNSM), which automatically updates the
parameters of the linesearch. Particular attention is paid to the minimum
sum-of-squares clustering problem, for which we provide a concrete
implementation of SNSM. We conclude with some numerical experiments where we
exhibit the advantages of SNSM in comparison with some known algorithms.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of atomistic, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties from
molecular structures underpins materials innovation. Existing computational and
experimental approaches lack the scalability required to efficiently navigate
chemical space. Scientific foundation models trained on large unlabeled
datasets offer a path toward exploring chemical space across diverse
application domains. Here we develop MIST, a family of molecular foundation
models with up to an order of magnitude more parameters and data than prior
works. Trained using a novel tokenization scheme that comprehensively captures
nuclear, electronic, and geometric information, MIST learns from a diverse
range of molecules. MIST models have been fine-tuned to predict more than 400
structure -- property relationships and match or exceed state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks spanning physiology, electrochemistry, and
quantum chemistry. We demonstrate the ability of these models to solve
real-world problems across chemical space, including multiobjective electrolyte
solvent screening, olfactory perception mapping, isotope half-life prediction,
stereochemical reasoning for chiral organometallic compounds, and binary and
multi-component mixture property prediction. Probing MIST models using
mechanistic interpretability methods reveals identifiable patterns and trends
not explicitly present in the training data, suggesting that the models learn
generalizable scientific concepts. We formulate hyperparameter-penalized
Bayesian neural scaling laws and use them to reduce the computational cost of
model development by an order of magnitude. The methods and findings presented
here represent a significant step toward accelerating materials discovery,
design, and optimization using foundation models and provide valuable guidance
for training compute-optimal scientific foundation models.

Abstract: This paper introduces SBAN (Source code, Binary, Assembly, and Natural
Language Description), a large-scale, multi-dimensional dataset designed to
advance the pre-training and evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for
software code analysis. SBAN comprises more than 3 million samples, including
2.9 million benign and 672,000 malware respectively, each represented across
four complementary layers: binary code, assembly instructions, natural language
descriptions, and source code. This unique multimodal structure enables
research on cross-representation learning, semantic understanding of software,
and automated malware detection. Beyond security applications, SBAN supports
broader tasks such as code translation, code explanation, and other software
mining tasks involving heterogeneous data. It is particularly suited for
scalable training of deep models, including transformers and other LLM

Abstract: Recent foundational models, SSAST, EAT, HuBERT, Qwen-Audio, and Audio

limited by fixed input rates and durations, hindering their reusability. This
paper introduces the Augmentation-driven Multiview Audio Transformer (AMAuT), a

stable temporal encoding, (3) dual CLS + TAL tokens for bidirectional context
representation, and (4) test-time adaptation/augmentation (TTA^2) to improve
inference reliability. Experiments on five public benchmarks, AudioMNIST,
SpeechCommands V1 & V2, VocalSound, and CochlScene, show that AMAuT achieves
accuracies up to 99.8% while consuming less than 3% of the GPU hours required
by comparable pre-trained models. Thus, AMAuT presents a highly efficient and
flexible alternative to large pre-trained models, making state-of-the-art audio
classification accessible in computationally constrained settings.

### [147] [Impartial Selection with Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19002)
*Javier Cembrano,Felix Fischer,Max Klimm*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于互提名的代理人选择机制，提出了带有预测的公正机制，在保证公正性的同时显著提高了选择性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于互提名的选择场景中，代理人可能为了自身利益而歪曲对其他代理人资格的判断。传统公正机制虽然避免了这一问题，但性能存在理论限制。本文旨在探索通过引入预测信息来提升公正机制的性能。

Method: 提出了带有预测的公正选择机制，定义了机制的一致性和鲁棒性指标。对于一般情况（选择k个代理人），给出了具有渐进最优一致性和鲁棒性的机制；对于特殊情况（选择单个代理人），证明了可以达到1-一致性和1/2-鲁棒性。

Result: 对于一般情况，机制达到1-O(1/k)的一致性和1-1/e-O(1/k)的鲁棒性；对于特殊情况，可以实现1-一致性和1/2-鲁棒性。结果显示在实现渐进最优一致性的同时，鲁棒性损失很小。

Conclusion: 通过引入预测信息，可以在保持公正性的前提下显著提升选择机制的性能，实现一致性的大幅改善而鲁棒性损失很小，为委员会选举、AI对齐等应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study the selection of agents based on mutual nominations, a theoretical
problem with many applications from committee selection to AI alignment. As
agents both select and are selected, they may be incentivized to misrepresent
their true opinion about the eligibility of others to influence their own
chances of selection. Impartial mechanisms circumvent this issue by
guaranteeing that the selection of an agent is independent of the nominations
cast by that agent. Previous research has established strong bounds on the
performance of impartial mechanisms, measured by their ability to approximate
the number of nominations for the most highly nominated agents. We study to
what extent the performance of impartial mechanisms can be improved if they are
given a prediction of a set of agents receiving a maximum number of
nominations. Specifically, we provide bounds on the consistency and robustness
of such mechanisms, where consistency measures the performance of the
mechanisms when the prediction is accurate and robustness its performance when
the prediction is inaccurate. For the general setting where up to $k$ agents
are to be selected and agents nominate any number of other agents, we give a
mechanism with consistency $1-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$ and robustness
$1-\frac{1}{e}-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$. For the special case of selecting a
single agent based on a single nomination per agent, we prove that
$1$-consistency can be achieved while guaranteeing $\frac{1}{2}$-robustness. A
close comparison with previous results shows that (asymptotically) optimal
consistency can be achieved with little to no sacrifice in terms of robustness.

Abstract: Advertisement auctions play a crucial role in revenue generation for
e-commerce companies. To make the bidding procedure scalable to thousands of
auctions, the automatic bidding (autobidding) algorithms are actively developed
in the industry. Therefore, the fair and reproducible evaluation of autobidding
algorithms is an important problem. We present a standardized and transparent
evaluation protocol for comparing classical and reinforcement learning (RL)
autobidding algorithms. We consider the most efficient autobidding algorithms
from different classes, e.g., ones based on the controllers, RL, optimal
formulas, etc., and benchmark them in the bidding environment. We utilize the
most recent open-source environment developed in the industry, which accurately
emulates the bidding process. Our work demonstrates the most promising use
cases for the considered autobidding algorithms, highlights their surprising
drawbacks, and evaluates them according to multiple metrics. We select the
evaluation metrics that illustrate the performance of the autobidding
algorithms, the corresponding costs, and track the budget pacing. Such a choice
of metrics makes our results applicable to the broad range of platforms where
autobidding is effective. The presented comparison results help practitioners
to evaluate the candidate autobidding algorithms from different perspectives
and select ones that are efficient according to their companies' targets.

Method: 使用图神经网络、归一化流和WaveNet算法的组合，将组织表示为神经随机微分方程，其中细胞是演化图的边。

Result: 模型不仅捕捉了随机细胞运动，还预测了细胞在分裂周期中的状态演化，能够准确生成发育系统（如果蝇翅膀）和细胞信号过程的实验动力学。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为生物工程和临床环境中的数字孪生使用，为组织动力学预测开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Tissue dynamics play a crucial role in biological processes ranging from
wound healing to morphogenesis. However, these noisy multicellular dynamics are
notoriously hard to predict. Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning
framework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from
experimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks,
normalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural
stochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph.
This machine learning architecture reflects the architecture of the underlying
biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed to train
it compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking
epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only
captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states
in their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately
generate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly
wing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the
way for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts.

*Richard J. Young,Brandon Gillins,Alice M. Matthews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个简化的评估框架，使用20个精心设计的提示来评估LLM在不同任务类别中的指令遵循能力，通过大规模实证研究测试了256个模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有基准可能被新模型记忆，需要新的评估方法来真正评估指令遵循能力，而不是记忆性能。需要一个实用的诊断工具来快速评估特定指令遵循模式。

Method: 构建包含20个提示的紧凑测试套件，平衡全面性和效率，每个提示针对指令遵循的不同方面（格式合规、内容约束、逻辑排序、多步骤任务执行）。在验证模型基本功能后，对256个模型进行大规模测试。

Result: 研究揭示了持续存在的失败模式，并识别出特定类型的指令对模型构成特别挑战。提供了主要提供商和新兴实现模型的比较性能分析。

Conclusion: 这项工作既提供了一个实用的评估工具，又对当代LLM领域的指令遵循能力进行了最全面的实证分析之一。

Abstract: Despite widespread deployment of Large Language Models, systematic evaluation
of instruction-following capabilities remains challenging. While comprehensive
benchmarks exist, focused assessments that quickly diagnose specific
instruction adherence patterns are valuable. As newer models may be trained on
existing benchmarks, novel evaluation approaches are needed to assess genuine
capabilities rather than memorized performance. This paper presents a
streamlined evaluation framework using twenty carefully designed prompts to
assess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories. We demonstrate
this framework through a large-scale empirical study conducted on October 14,
2025, testing 256 verified working models from 331 available via OpenRouter. To
ensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each
model's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks
requiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical
diagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our
methodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact
test suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets
distinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content
constraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate
models from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral) and
emerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing
comparative performance analysis. Our findings reveal consistent failure modes
and identify specific instruction types posing particular challenges. This work
contributes both a practical evaluation tool and one of the most comprehensive
empirical analyses of instruction-following capabilities across the
contemporary LLM landscape.

TL;DR: 通过微调RoBERTa和CodeBERTa等小型语言模型，在机器生成内容检测任务中实现了比大型语言模型更好的性能，同时显著降低了计算成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于零样本方法的机器生成内容检测器存在计算成本高或准确率不足的问题，需要在准确性和效率之间做出权衡。

Method: 使用专门的源代码和自然语言数据集，对预训练的RoBERTa和CodeBERTa等编码器模型进行微调，用于二元分类任务。

Result: 模型在AUROC指标上达到0.97-0.99，宏F1分数达到0.89-0.94，同时将延迟降低8-12倍，峰值VRAM使用减少3-5倍。在跨生成器迁移和对抗性转换下，性能保持清洁AUROC的92%以上。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型在机器生成内容检测任务中显著优于大型语言模型，同时大幅降低了计算资源需求，为高效准确的检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating multilingual
text and source code has only increased the imperative for machine-generated
content detectors to be accurate and efficient across domains. Current
detectors, predominantly utilizing zero-shot methods, such as Fast DetectGPT or
GPTZero, either incur high computational cost or lack sufficient accuracy,
often with a trade-off between the two, leaving room for further improvement.
To address these gaps, we propose the fine-tuning of encoder-only Small
Language Models (SLMs), in particular, the pre-trained models of RoBERTA and
CodeBERTa using specialized datasets on source code and other natural language
to prove that for the task of binary classification, SLMs outperform LLMs by a
huge margin whilst using a fraction of compute. Our encoders achieve AUROC $=
0.97$ to $0.99$ and macro-F1 $0.89$ to $0.94$ while reducing latency by
$8$-$12\times$ and peak VRAM by $3$-$5\times$ at $512$-token inputs. Under
cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations (paraphrase,
back-translation; code formatting/renaming), performance retains $\geq 92%$ of
clean AUROC. We release training and evaluation scripts with seeds and configs;
a reproducibility checklist is also included.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在复杂任务中的创造力通常需要难以扩展的人工评估，需要开发可扩展的自动化评估方法。

Method: 通过分析叙事中的符号化角色网络（带符号边权重的网络），使用网络属性如密度、聚类和符号边权重来评估故事。基于1,200多个故事的网络分析，比较了四个主要LLM和人类写作语料库。

Result: LLM生成的故事始终表现出强烈的偏向紧密联系、积极关系的偏见，这与之前使用人工评估的研究发现一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估当前和未来LLM在创意讲故事中的局限性和倾向提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Evaluating the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
complex tasks often requires human assessments that are difficult to scale. We
introduce a novel, scalable methodology for evaluating LLM story generation by
analyzing underlying social structures in narratives as signed character
networks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct a large-scale
comparative analysis using networks from over 1,200 stories, generated by four
leading LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash) and a
human-written corpus. Our findings, based on network properties like density,
clustering, and signed edge weights, show that LLM-generated stories
consistently exhibit a strong bias toward tightly-knit, positive relationships,
which aligns with findings from prior research using human assessment. Our
proposed approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating limitations and
tendencies in the creative storytelling of current and future LLMs.

Motivation: 现有LLM评估主要局限于数学、编程等易于验证的任务，而现实应用需要评估LLM处理专业文档和生成综合报告的能力。

Method: 构建ProfBench基准，包含人类专家评估的响应-标准对；开发经济高效的LLM-Judge评估系统，通过缓解自我增强偏见将评估成本降低2-3个数量级。

Abstract: Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by
the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like
mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many
real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional
documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in
response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000
response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional
knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We
build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by
mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3
orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community.
Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for
state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving
only 65.9\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance
disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and provide insights

Motivation: 扩展知识冲突研究到代码生成领域，探索LLMs如何处理参数知识与提示信息之间的冲突，为理解模型行为提供新视角。

Method: 提出领域无关的知识冲突构建框架，开发针对代码冲突场景的新评估方法和数据集，使用激活级引导技术进行实验。

Result: 大模型能编码知识冲突概念，冲突检测准确率达80.65%，激活引导相比随机基线提升12.6%的引导成功率。

Conclusion: 模型大小、任务领域和引导方向的平衡对知识冲突处理效果至关重要，为理解LLMs行为提供了新见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) behave when faced
with discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and conflicting
information contained in a prompt. Building on prior question-answering (QA)
research, we extend the investigation of knowledge conflicts to the realm of
code generation. We propose a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and
interpreting such conflicts, along with a novel evaluation method and dataset
tailored to code conflict scenarios. Our experiments indicate that sufficiently
large LLMs encode the notion of a knowledge conflict in their parameters,
enabling us to detect knowledge conflicts with up to \textbf{80.65\%} accuracy.
Building on these insights, we show that activation-level steering can achieve
up to a \textbf{12.6\%} improvement in steering success over a random baseline.
However, effectiveness depends critically on balancing model size, task domain,
and steering direction. The experiment code and data will be made publicly
available after acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在取得显著成果的同时，区分事实推理和幻觉仍然具有挑战性，需要开发新的检测方法。

Method: 将transformer层建模为动态图，使用图信号处理技术定义Dirichlet能量、频谱熵和高频能量比等诊断指标，并建立与计算稳定性的理论联系。

Result: 实验发现普遍频谱模式：事实陈述呈现一致的"能量山"行为，而不同类型的幻觉显示独特特征。基于频谱特征的检测器达到88.75%准确率，优于基于困惑度的基线方法。

Conclusion: 频谱几何能够捕捉推理模式和错误行为，为大型语言模型中的幻觉检测提供了一个有前景的框架。

Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual
reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral
analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by
attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph
signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral
entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to
computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal
spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain"
behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types
show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large
effect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity
drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A
simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75%
for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings
indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error
behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in
large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同transformer架构如何通过不同的连接模式实现相同的语言计算，并探索这些计算指纹如何反映模型的训练偏好和架构特征。

Method: 使用图信号处理分析注意力诱导的token图，在20种语言和3个模型家族中跟踪代数连通性（Fiedler值）在语音转换过程中的变化，重点关注早期层（2-5层）。

Result: 发现清晰的架构特征：Phi-3-Mini在英语中表现出显著的早期层中断，而其他19种语言影响很小；Qwen2.5-7B对形态丰富语言显示小规模分布式变化；LLaMA-3.2-1B表现出系统但温和的响应。这些特征与行为差异强相关。

Conclusion: 训练重点会在计算中留下可检测的印记，表现为在句法转换过程中可测量的连接模式。该方法可作为无需训练的简单诊断工具，用于揭示架构偏见和支持模型可靠性分析。

Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic
computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted
``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using
graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in
algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice
alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified
early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural
signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption
($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19
other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that
positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small,
distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and
LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures
correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are
modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early
attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the
findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave
detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that
manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations.
Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes,
indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing
architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发不依赖大型语言模型的RAG的问答系统，通过知识图谱检索和释义来生成答案，减少对计算资源的需求。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：第一阶段预处理文档生成问答对，第二阶段将问答对转换为知识图谱，使用嵌入和模糊技术进行图谱检索，最后对检索结果进行重排序和释义。

Result: 在CRAG基准测试中使用LLM-as-a-judge评估，使用LLAMA-3.2和GPT-3.5-Turbo分别达到71.9%和54.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: 证明基于知识图谱检索和释义的方法可以在不依赖RAG的情况下实现有效的问答系统，为资源受限环境提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a question answering system that operates exclusively on
a knowledge graph retrieval without relying on retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) with large language models (LLMs). Instead, a small paraphraser model is
used to paraphrase the entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the
knowledge graph. The proposed pipeline is divided into two main stages. The
first stage involves pre-processing a document to generate sets of
question-answer (QA) pairs. The second stage converts these QAs into a
knowledge graph from which graph-based retrieval is performed using embeddings
and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to
generate a final answer. This work includes an evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge
on the CRAG benchmark, which resulted in accuracies of 71.9% and 54.4% using
LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, respectively.

TL;DR: MoE-Prism通过将MoE模型中的单体专家分解为细粒度子专家，并配合在线调度引擎，实现了弹性AI服务，提供了更多操作点来平衡成本与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型通过稀疏激活参数实现高质量，但仅提供少量粗粒度操作点，导致成本与质量之间的困难权衡，无法适应多样化的服务级别目标，造成资源过度配置。

Method: 1. 离线重构引擎：使用基于元启发式的分区优化求解器将单体专家分解为细粒度子专家，保持功能局部性且无需重新训练；2. 在线调度引擎：实现QoS感知调度，包括云部署中的吞吐量最大化和内存受限设备的延迟优化卸载。

Result: 在三个不同MoE模型上的评估显示，MoE-Prism比基线提供超过4倍的不同稳定操作点，在严格延迟预算下可将吞吐量提高19.9%，在有限资源下可将延迟降低10.36%。

Conclusion: MoE-Prism提供了关键的"控制旋钮"来弥合模型与系统之间的差距，实现了下一代自适应、高效且QoS感知的AI服务。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI,
achieve high quality by sparsely activating parameters. However, their reliance
on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a
"quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This
inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing
adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to
significant resource over-provisioning.
  This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms
rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two
phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs
monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a
partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to
group neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining.
Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity
through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve
complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments
and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our
evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over
4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows
an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict
latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources.
MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap,
enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

Method: 使用Whisper及其衍生模型在英语和日语上评估MBR解码

Result: MBR解码在大多数实验设置中优于波束搜索的准确率

Conclusion: MBR解码是需要高准确率的离线ASR和ST任务的有前景方法

Abstract: Recent work has shown that sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding
outperforms beam search in text-to-text generation tasks, such as machine
translation, text summarization, and image captioning. On the other hand, beam
search is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding
is effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to
also be effective for speech-to-text tasks. In this paper, we evaluate MBR
decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its
derivative models. We observe that the accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms
that of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated. The
results show that MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST
tasks that require high accuracy. The code is available at

Abstract: Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction
data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively
expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically
mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web
scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key
challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action
labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module
(IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and
localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an
action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click
coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube
tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps
automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by
supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success
rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On
AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results
demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality
supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to
expensive manual annotation.

### [161] [Are Large Language Models Sensitive to the Motives Behind Communication?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19687)
*Addison J. Wu,Ryan Liu,Kerem Oktar,Theodore R. Sumers,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型是否具备动机警觉能力，即能否像人类一样考虑信息来源的动机来评估内容可信度。研究发现LLMs在受控实验中能像人类一样理性处理有偏信息，但在真实广告场景中表现不佳，需要通过干预提升其动机敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类沟通具有动机性，而LLMs处理的信息也受到人类意图和动机的影响。为了让LLMs在现实世界中有效工作，它们必须能够像人类一样批判性地评估内容，考虑信息来源的动机。

Method: 首先使用认知科学的受控实验验证LLMs行为是否与理性学习模型一致，然后扩展到赞助在线广告等更自然的信息环境，并测试简单的引导干预是否能提升动机警觉性。

Result: 在受控实验中，LLMs能成功像人类一样对有偏信息来源进行折扣处理；但在真实广告场景中，LLMs的推理与理性模型预测不符，部分原因是额外信息分散了注意力。简单的引导干预能显著提升LLMs与理性模型的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs具备对他人动机的基本敏感性，但要将其泛化到新的现实世界场景，还需要对这些模型进行进一步改进。

Abstract: Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content
with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that
large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by
humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced
information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order
to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,
they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of
the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales
pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have
this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled
experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent
with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they
successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.
We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic
reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find
that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as
closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from
vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that
boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the
correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that
LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing
to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

TL;DR: Zhyper是一个参数高效的因子化超网络框架，通过文本描述生成上下文感知的LoRA适配器，用于大语言模型的文化对齐，比现有方法减少26倍参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法确保大语言模型按照特定文化规范生成内容，直接微调LoRA权重会引入大量参数。

Method: 提出Zhyper框架，使用因子化超网络从文本描述生成上下文感知的LoRA适配器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，参数比最先进基线减少26倍，在文化对齐任务中展现出更好的泛化能力和细粒度上下文价值捕捉。

Conclusion: Zhyper提供了一种参数高效的大语言模型文化对齐方法，显著减少了参数数量同时保持了竞争力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) conditioning refers to instructing an LLM to
generate content in accordance with the norms and values of a specific culture,
beliefs of a particular political orientation, or any desired text-specified
semantic conditioning. Unfortunately, prompt engineering does not ensure that
LLMs behave in accordance with a desired conditioning due to the inductive bias
of the pre-training and alignment datasets. Prior works have focused on
fine-tuning LLMs by directly conditioning the LoRA weights; however, such
methods introduce a large number of parameters. As a remedy, we propose Zhyper,
a parameter-efficient factorized hypernetwork framework that generates
context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x
fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we extend
Zhyper to cultural alignment, demonstrating improved generalization to
out-of-domain settings and a better capturing of fine-grained contextual
values.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SmartSwitch推理框架，通过检测和干预大语言模型的"欠思考"问题，引导模型深入探索有潜力的推理路径，提升复杂推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在长链推理中存在的"欠思考"问题，即模型经常浅层切换思路而缺乏充分探索，这限制了推理性能和token效率。

Method: SmartSwitch框架包含感知模块和干预模块。感知模块检测思路切换点并用过程奖励模型评估前一个思路的潜力；干预模块在发现高潜力思路被过早放弃时回溯并插入"深化提示"来鼓励深入探索。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试中，该方法显著提升了不同规模大语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: SmartSwitch是一个简单有效的即插即用推理策略，能够有效解决大语言模型的欠思考问题，提升复杂推理能力。

Abstract: The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent
breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks.
However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit
shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient
exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch
inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large
language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's
reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper
exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception
module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of
the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a
high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention
module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the
switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along
that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
performance of various large language models of different sizes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSPEC是一种新的知识蒸馏方法，通过选择性过滤难以拟合的token来提高推测解码中的token接受率，在多个任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的知识蒸馏方法最小化所有token的KL散度，这与推测解码最大化token接受率的目标不一致，导致草稿模型难以充分吸收目标模型知识。

Method: AdaSPEC使用参考模型识别并过滤难以拟合的token，在知识蒸馏过程中只关注更简单的token，从而训练出与目标模型更匹配的草稿模型。

Result: 在算术推理、指令遵循、编程和摘要等任务上，使用31M/1.4B和350M/2.7B参数配置，AdaSPEC在所有任务中都优于最先进的DistillSpec方法，接受率最高提升15%。

Conclusion: AdaSPEC通过选择性token过滤改进了知识蒸馏过程，在不影响生成质量的前提下提高了推测解码的token接受率。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by
employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified
by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment
between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation
(KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence
between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is
misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance
rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target
model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that
incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a
reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling
the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on
simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate
without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse
tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and
summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters.
Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across
all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Scaf-GRPO是一种渐进式训练框架，通过在模型学习停滞时提供分层提示来克服强化学习中的“学习悬崖”现象，显著提升LLM解决复杂数学问题的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于可验证奖励的强化学习方法面临“学习悬崖”问题：当问题远超模型当前能力时，模型持续失败导致零奖励信号，优势计算归零，使困难问题对学习梯度不可见，阻碍进展。

Method: 提出Scaf-GRPO框架，首先诊断学习停滞，然后通过注入分层提示（从抽象概念到具体步骤）进行干预，使模型能够自行构建有效解决方案。

Result: 在挑战性数学基准测试中，Scaf-GRPO将Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型在AIME24基准上的pass@1得分相对普通GRPO基线提升了44.3%。

Conclusion: 该框架为解锁模型解决先前无法处理问题的能力提供了稳健有效的方法论，是扩展LLM自主推理前沿的关键一步。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful
technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the
''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their
current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent
zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses
the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible
to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce
Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive
training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a
model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses
learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,
ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to
construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging
mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the
pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative
44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework
provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to
solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending
the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

TL;DR: Hubble是一套用于研究LLM记忆机制的开源大语言模型，包含标准版和扰动版，通过控制文本插入来模拟记忆风险，揭示了训练语料大小和敏感数据出现时机对记忆的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM记忆机制，特别是敏感数据在训练过程中的记忆风险，为理解和缓解LLM记忆问题提供实证基础。

Method: 开发标准模型和扰动模型，在训练过程中控制插入特定文本（如书籍段落、传记、测试集），比较不同参数规模（1B/8B）和训练token数量（100B/500B）下的记忆表现。

Result: 发现记忆风险由敏感数据在训练语料中的相对频率决定；敏感数据缺乏持续暴露会被遗忘；增加训练语料规模可以稀释敏感数据；敏感数据在训练早期出现更易被记忆。

Conclusion: 提出了缓解记忆风险的最佳实践：通过增大训练语料稀释敏感数据，以及让敏感数据在训练早期出现。Hubble为记忆研究、成员推断和机器遗忘提供了理想测试平台。

Abstract: We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs)
for the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard
and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English
corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled
insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to
emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard
and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B
tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency
of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password
appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password
in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text
inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without
continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices
for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the
size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in
training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range
of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how
readily different types of private information are memorized. We also
demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed
for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to
further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are central to both practical
applications and the development of optimization methods. While classical and
quantum algorithms have been refined over decades, machine learning-assisted
approaches are comparatively recent and have not yet consistently outperformed
simple, state-of-the-art classical methods. Here, we focus on a class of
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, specifically the
challenge of finding minimum energy configurations in three-dimensional Ising
spin glasses. We use a Global Annealing Monte Carlo algorithm that integrates
standard local moves with global moves proposed via machine learning. We show
that local moves play a crucial role in achieving optimal performance.
Benchmarking against Simulated Annealing and Population Annealing, we
demonstrate that Global Annealing not only surpasses the performance of
Simulated Annealing but also exhibits greater robustness than Population
Annealing, maintaining effectiveness across problem hardness and system size
without hyperparameter tuning. These results provide, to our knowledge, the
first clear and robust evidence that a machine learning-assisted optimization
method can exceed the capabilities of classical state-of-the-art techniques in
a combinatorial optimization setting.

Abstract: Wireless power transfer (WPT) with coupled resonators offers a promising
solution for the seamless powering of electronic devices. Interactive design
approaches that visualize the magnetic field and power transfer efficiency
based on system geometry adjustments can facilitate the understanding and
exploration of the behavior of these systems for dynamic applications. However,
typical electromagnetic field simulation methods, such as the Method of Moments
(MoM), require significant computational resources, limiting the rate at which
computation can be performed for acceptable interactivity. Furthermore, the
system's sensitivity to positional and geometrical changes necessitates a large
number of simulations, and structures such as ferromagnetic shields further
complicate these simulations. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach
using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), demonstrating for the first time the
rapid estimation of the entire magnetic field and power transfer efficiency for
near-field coupled systems. To achieve quick and accurate estimation, we
develop 3D adaptive grid systems and an active learning strategy to effectively
capture the nonlinear interactions between complex system geometries and
magnetic fields. By training a regression model, our approach achieves magnetic
field computation with sub-second latency and with an average error of less
than 6% when validated against independent electromagnetic simulation results.

Conclusion: 该分层框架成功解决了DLO长时程路由任务的关键挑战，通过结合高层推理和低层技能执行，实现了高成功率和良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-horizon routing tasks of deformable linear objects (DLOs), such as
cables and ropes, are common in industrial assembly lines and everyday life.
These tasks are particularly challenging because they require robots to
manipulate DLO with long-horizon planning and reliable skill execution.
Successfully completing such tasks demands adapting to their nonlinear
dynamics, decomposing abstract routing goals, and generating multi-step plans
composed of multiple skills, all of which require accurate high-level reasoning
during execution. In this paper, we propose a fully autonomous hierarchical
framework for solving challenging DLO routing tasks. Given an implicit or
explicit routing goal expressed in language, our framework leverages
vision-language models~(VLMs) for in-context high-level reasoning to synthesize
feasible plans, which are then executed by low-level skills trained via
reinforcement learning. To improve robustness in long horizons, we further
introduce a failure recovery mechanism that reorients the DLO into
insertion-feasible states. Our approach generalizes to diverse scenes involving
object attributes, spatial descriptions, as well as implicit language commands.
It outperforms the next best baseline method by nearly 50% and achieves an
overall success rate of 92.5% across long-horizon routing scenarios.

Abstract: Increasingly large datasets of robot actions and sensory observations are
being collected to train ever-larger neural networks. These datasets are
collected based on tasks and while these tasks may be distinct in their
descriptions, many involve very similar physical action sequences (e.g., 'pick
up an apple' versus 'pick up an orange'). As a result, many datasets of robotic
tasks are substantially imbalanced in terms of the physical robotic actions
they represent. In this work, we propose a simple sampling strategy for policy
training that mitigates this imbalance. Our method requires only a few lines of
code to integrate into existing codebases and improves generalization. We
evaluate our method in both pre-training small models and fine-tuning large
foundational models. Our results show substantial improvements on low-resource
tasks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, without degrading performance
on high-resource tasks. This enables more effective use of model capacity for
multi-task policies. We also further validate our approach in a real-world
setup on a Franka Panda robot arm across a diverse set of tasks.

complex tasks from expert human demonstrations. However, it remains limited by
its reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, restricting adaptability to
the diverse range of real-world object configurations and scenarios. In
contrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations,
partial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer
broader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation
learning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these
challenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement
learning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the
performance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline
RL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under
the sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world,
simple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data,
without significant additional assumptions. Our approach shows that broadening
the support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented
by offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery
and generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations
significantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies
are successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that
these methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or
suboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This
underscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data
for robust policy learning in robotics.

### [174] [Universal Quantitative Abstraction: Categorical Duality and Logical Completeness for Probabilistic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19444)
*Nivar Anwer*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: 本文提出了概率系统的统一量化抽象理论，连接了范畴论、最优传输和量化模态逻辑。核心是带有通用性质的ε-商构造，在抽象与实现函子间建立伴随关系，揭示了度量结构与逻辑语义的范畴对偶性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为概率系统开发统一的量化抽象理论，连接范畴论、最优传输和量化模态逻辑，提供状态聚合和表示学习的理论基础，为随机域中的值函数近似提供数学精确保证。

Method: 构建具有通用性质的ε-商构造，建立抽象与实现函子间的伴随关系；引入量化模态μ-演算；在余代数框架下证明行为伪度量的收缩性和Lipschitz性质；分析接口细化下的组合性。

Result: 行为伪度量被刻画为Bellman风格算子的唯一不动点；量化模态μ-演算对逻辑可表示系统具有表达完备性；在有限马尔可夫决策过程上验证了收缩性、值损失界、扰动稳定性等性质。

Conclusion: 该框架为状态聚合和表示学习提供了原则性目标，为随机域中的值函数近似提供了数学精确保证，展示了鲁棒性和计算可行性。

Abstract: A unified theory of quantitative abstraction is presented for probabilistic
systems that links category theory, optimal transport, and quantitative modal
logic. At its core is a canonical $ \varepsilon $-quotient endowed with a
universal property: among all $ \varepsilon $-abstractions, it is the most
informative one that respects a prescribed bound on value loss. This
construction induces an adjunction between abstraction and realization functors
$ (Q_{\varepsilon} \dashv R_{\varepsilon}) $, established via the Special
Adjoint Functor Theorem, revealing a categorical duality between metric
structure and logical semantics. A behavioral pseudometric is characterized as
the unique fixed point of a Bellman-style operator, with contraction and
Lipschitz properties proved in a coalgebraic setting. A quantitative modal $
\mu $-calculus is introduced and shown to be expressively complete for
logically representable systems, so that behavioral distance coincides with
maximal logical deviation. Compositionality under interface refinement is
analyzed, clarifying how abstractions interact across system boundaries. An
exact validation suite on finite Markov decision processes corroborates the
contraction property, value-loss bounds, stability under perturbation,
adversarial distinguishability, and scalability, demonstrating both robustness
and computational feasibility. The resulting framework provides principled
targets for state aggregation and representation learning, with mathematically
precise guarantees for value-function approximation in stochastic domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SysMoBench是一个评估AI为大型复杂系统生成形式化模型能力的基准测试，专注于并发和分布式系统，使用TLA+规范语言，包含9个系统组件并自动化评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形式化模型对于指定和验证大型复杂计算机系统至关重要，但编写和维护成本高昂。现有AI方法主要针对小规模代码而非完整系统，需要评估AI能否处理现实系统组件并将其复杂行为属性抽象为形式化模型。

Method: 开发SysMoBench基准测试，专注于并发和分布式系统，使用TLA+作为规范语言，自动化评估语法正确性、运行时正确性、与系统代码一致性以及不变式正确性等指标。

Result: SysMoBench目前包含9个多样化系统组件，如Etcd和Redis的Raft实现、Asterinas OS中的自旋锁和互斥锁等，更多组件正在积极添加中。

Conclusion: SysMoBench能够帮助理解当前LLM和智能体的能力与局限性，为该领域工具奠定坚实基础并开辟有前景的新研究方向。

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

TL;DR: 提出PRISM方法，通过组不变核学习来缓解基于偏好的奖励模型中的捷径行为问题，提高奖励模型在分布外任务上的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于人类反馈的奖励模型容易受到奖励攻击和泛化能力差的问题，模型倾向于利用训练数据中的虚假特征（如回答冗长、讨好语气等）来获取高分，而非真正反映人类意图。

Method: 受核视角下不变性理论启发，提出PRISM方法，通过闭式学习目标学习具有特征映射的组不变核，缓解捷径行为。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法持续提高了奖励模型在分布外任务上的准确性，并减少了下游策略模型对捷径的依赖。

Conclusion: PRISM为基于偏好的对齐建立了一个鲁棒框架，能有效缓解奖励模型中的捷径行为问题。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了WorldTest评估协议和AutumnBench测试套件，用于评估模型学习代理的世界模型能力，发现人类表现优于前沿模型，计算扩展仅在部分环境中有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型学习方法过于依赖下一帧预测和相同环境中的奖励最大化，无法评估模型对多种下游任务的通用支持能力。

Method: 设计WorldTest协议：奖励无关的探索阶段+不同但相关环境中的评分测试阶段；创建AutumnBench套件，包含43个网格世界环境和129个任务，涵盖掩码帧预测、规划和因果动态变化预测三类任务。

Result: 517名人类参与者和3个前沿模型对比测试显示：人类表现优于模型；计算扩展仅在部分环境中提升性能，而非所有环境。

Conclusion: WorldTest为评估代理对环境动态的学习提供了新模板，AutumnBench揭示了世界模型学习的显著提升空间。

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.

Conclusion: ML驱动的可视化分析有潜力提高空气质量管理中的态势感知能力，支持数据驱动的决策制定。

Abstract: Urban air pollution poses significant risks to public health, environmental
sustainability, and policy planning. Effective air quality management requires
predictive tools that can integrate diverse datasets and communicate complex
spatial and temporal pollution patterns. There is a gap in interactive tools
with seamless integration of forecasting and visualization of spatial
distributions of air pollutant concentrations. We present CityAQVis, an
interactive machine learning ML sandbox tool designed to predict and visualize
pollutant concentrations at the ground level using multi-source data, which
includes satellite observations, meteorological parameters, population density,
elevation, and nighttime lights. While traditional air quality visualization
tools often lack forecasting capabilities, CityAQVis enables users to build and
compare predictive models, visualizing the model outputs and offering insights
into pollution dynamics at the ground level. The pilot implementation of the
tool is tested through case studies predicting nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
concentrations in metropolitan regions, highlighting its adaptability to
various pollutants. Through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), the
user can perform comparative visualizations of the spatial distribution of
surface-level pollutant concentration in two different urban scenarios. Our
results highlight the potential of ML-driven visual analytics to improve
situational awareness and support data-driven decision-making in air quality
management.

Abstract: Domestic AI agents faces ethical, autonomy, and inclusion challenges,
particularly for overlooked groups like children, elderly, and Neurodivergent
users. We present the Plural Voices Model (PVM), a novel single-agent framework
that dynamically negotiates multi-user needs through real-time value alignment,

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在宇宙学推断中使用迁移学习的方法，通过先在标准宇宙学模型ΛCDM上预训练，然后在各种超越ΛCDM场景上微调，可以显著减少所需模拟数量。但同时也发现了当ΛCDM与超越ΛCDM参数存在强物理简并时会出现负迁移现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在宇宙学推断中具有强大能力，但通常需要大量高保真模拟覆盖多种宇宙学模型。迁移学习提供了一种通过跨模型重用知识来降低模拟成本的方法。

Method: 采用迁移学习方法，先在标准宇宙学模型ΛCDM上预训练，然后在各种超越ΛCDM场景（包括大质量中微子、修正引力和原始非高斯性）上微调。考虑了不同的迁移架构，发现包含瓶颈结构能提供最佳性能。

Result: 预训练可以显著减少超越ΛCDM模拟的需求，但当ΛCDM与超越ΛCDM参数存在强物理简并时会发生负迁移现象。包含瓶颈结构的迁移架构表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究结果说明了物理学中基础模型方法的机遇和陷阱：预训练可以加速推断，但也可能阻碍新物理的学习。

Abstract: Machine learning enables powerful cosmological inference but typically
requires many high-fidelity simulations covering many cosmological models.
Transfer learning offers a way to reduce the simulation cost by reusing
knowledge across models. We show that pre-training on the standard model of
cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM, and fine-tuning on various beyond-$\Lambda$CDM
scenarios -- including massive neutrinos, modified gravity, and primordial
non-Gaussianities -- can enable inference with significantly fewer
beyond-$\Lambda$CDM simulations. However, we also show that negative transfer
can occur when strong physical degeneracies exist between $\Lambda$CDM and
beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameters. We consider various transfer architectures,
finding that including bottleneck structures provides the best performance. Our
findings illustrate the opportunities and pitfalls of foundation-model
approaches in physics: pre-training can accelerate inference, but may also
hinder learning new physics.

Motivation: 公共和非营利组织因大多数AI模型不透明而犹豫采用，尽管标准方法通常分析聚合模式而非提供可操作的具体案例指导。

Method: 采用实践者参与的工作流程，将透明决策树模型与LLM配对：首先构建可解释决策树识别关键预测因子，然后将树结构提供给LLM，使其基于透明模型生成案例级预测。实践者全程参与特征工程、模型设计、解释审查和可用性评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为公共和非营利部门负责任地采用AI提供了一条可行途径，通过结合透明模型、LLM和实践者专业知识，实现了准确、可信赖且可操作的AI应用。

Abstract: Public and nonprofit organizations often hesitate to adopt AI tools because
most models are opaque even though standard approaches typically analyze
aggregate patterns rather than offering actionable, case-level guidance. This
study tests a practitioner-in-the-loop workflow that pairs transparent
decision-tree models with large language models (LLMs) to improve predictive
accuracy, interpretability, and the generation of practical insights. Using
data from an ongoing college-success program, we build interpretable decision
trees to surface key predictors. We then provide each tree's structure to an
LLM, enabling it to reproduce case-level predictions grounded in the
transparent models. Practitioners participate throughout feature engineering,
model design, explanation review, and usability assessment, ensuring that field
expertise informs the analysis at every stage. Results show that integrating
transparent models, LLMs, and practitioner input yields accurate, trustworthy,
and actionable case-level evaluations, offering a viable pathway for
responsible AI adoption in the public and nonprofit sectors.

Abstract: Course syllabi set the tone and expectations for courses, shaping the
learning experience for both students and instructors. In computing courses,
especially those addressing fairness and ethics in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and algorithmic design, it is imperative that we
understand how approaches to navigating barriers to fair outcomes are being
addressed.These expectations should be inclusive, transparent, and grounded in
promoting critical thinking. Syllabus analysis offers a way to evaluate the
coverage, depth, practices, and expectations within a course. Manual syllabus
evaluation, however, is time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. To address
this, we developed a justice-oriented scoring rubric and asked a large language
model (LLM) to review syllabi through a multi-perspective role simulation.
Using this rubric, we evaluated 24 syllabi from four perspectives: instructor,
departmental chair, institutional reviewer, and external evaluator. We also
prompted the LLM to identify thematic trends across the courses. Findings show
that multiperspective evaluation aids us in noting nuanced, role-specific
priorities, leveraging them to fill hidden gaps in curricula design of AI/ML
and related computing courses focused on fairness and ethics. These insights
offer concrete directions for improving the design and delivery of fairness,
ethics, and justice content in such courses.

Abstract: LLMs have recently demonstrated strong potential in simulating online shopper
behavior. Prior work has improved action prediction by applying SFT on action
traces with LLM-generated rationales, and by leveraging RL to further enhance
reasoning capabilities. Despite these advances, current approaches rely on
text-based inputs and overlook the essential role of visual perception in
shaping human decision-making during web GUI interactions. In this paper, we
investigate the integration of visual information, specifically webpage
screenshots, into behavior simulation via VLMs, leveraging OPeRA dataset. By
grounding agent decision-making in both textual and visual modalities, we aim
to narrow the gap between synthetic agents and real-world users, thereby
enabling more cognitively aligned simulations of online shopping behavior.
Specifically, we employ SFT for joint action prediction and rationale
generation, conditioning on the full interaction context, which comprises
action history, past HTML observations, and the current webpage screenshot. To
further enhance reasoning capabilities, we integrate RL with a hierarchical
reward structure, scaled by a difficulty-aware factor that prioritizes
challenging decision points. Empirically, our studies show that incorporating
visual grounding yields substantial gains: the combination of text and image
inputs improves exact match accuracy by more than 6% over text-only inputs.
These results indicate that multi-modal grounding not only boosts predictive
accuracy but also enhances simulation fidelity in visually complex
environments, which captures nuances of human attention and decision-making
that text-only agents often miss. Finally, we revisit the design space of
behavior simulation frameworks, identify key methodological limitations, and
propose future research directions toward building efficient and effective
human behavior simulators.

Motivation: 研究transformer的表达能力，特别是其在描述概念时的简洁性，并与传统形式语言表示方法进行比较。

Method: 提出简洁性作为衡量标准，通过理论证明比较transformer与有限自动机、LTL公式在表示形式语言时的表达能力差异。

Result: 证明transformer能够比有限自动机和LTL公式更简洁地表示形式语言，同时验证transformer属性是EXPSPACE完全的难解问题。

Conclusion: transformer具有强大的表达能力，能够简洁表示复杂形式语言，但这种强大表达能力也带来了验证上的计算复杂性挑战。

Abstract: We propose succinctness as a measure of the expressive power of a transformer
in describing a concept. To this end, we prove that transformers are highly
expressive in that they can represent formal languages substantially more
succinctly than standard representations of formal languages like finite
automata and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. As a by-product of this
expressivity, we show that verifying properties of transformers is provably
intractable (i.e. EXPSPACE-complete).

Conclusion: Dara为复杂XRD模式的可扩展分析提供了基础，推动了多模态表征工作流程的集成，向全自动材料发现迈进。

Abstract: Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a foundational technique for characterizing
crystalline materials. However, the reliable interpretation of XRD patterns,
particularly in multiphase systems, remains a manual and expertise-demanding
task. As a characterization method that only provides structural information,
multiple reference phases can often be fit to a single pattern, leading to
potential misinterpretation when alternative solutions are overlooked. To ease
humans' efforts and address the challenge, we introduce Dara (Data-driven
Automated Rietveld Analysis), a framework designed to automate the robust
identification and refinement of multiple phases from powder XRD data. Dara
performs an exhaustive tree search over all plausible phase combinations within
a given chemical space and validates each hypothesis using a robust Rietveld
refinement routine (BGMN). Key features include structural database filtering,
automatic clustering of isostructural phases during tree expansion,
peak-matching-based scoring to identify promising phases for refinement. When
ambiguity exists, Dara generates multiple hypothesis which can then be decided
between by human experts or with further characteriztion tools. By enhancing
the reliability and accuracy of phase identification, Dara enables scalable
analysis of realistic complex XRD patterns and provides a foundation for
integration into multimodal characterization workflows, moving toward fully
self-driving materials discovery.

*Danial Ebrahimzadeh,Sarah Sharif,Yaser Mike Banad*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: SyntheFormer是一个预测无机晶体实验可合成性的正-未标记框架，结合傅里叶变换晶体周期性表示、层次特征提取和深度MLP分类器，在时间分离评估中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测哪些假设的无机晶体能够通过实验实现是加速材料发现的核心挑战，需要超越热力学稳定性的合成性预测方法。

Method: 使用傅里叶变换晶体周期性表示、层次特征提取、随机森林特征选择和紧凑深度MLP分类器，在2011-2018年历史数据上训练，并在2019-2025年进行前瞻性评估。

Result: 在测试集上获得0.735的ROC曲线下面积，通过双阈值校准实现97.6%召回率和94.2%覆盖率的高召回筛选，能够识别远离凸包的亚稳态化合物。

Conclusion: SyntheFormer通过结构感知表示和不确定性感知决策规则，为优先选择合成目标和聚焦实验室努力提供了实用途径，证明稳定性本身不足以预测实验可行性。

Abstract: Predicting which hypothetical inorganic crystals can be experimentally
realized remains a central challenge in accelerating materials discovery.
SyntheFormer is a positive-unlabeled framework that learns synthesizability
directly from crystal structure, combining a Fourier-transformed crystal
periodicity (FTCP) representation with hierarchical feature extraction,
Random-Forest feature selection, and a compact deep MLP classifier. The model
is trained on historical data from 2011 through 2018 and evaluated
prospectively on future years from 2019 to 2025, where the positive class
constitutes only 1.02 per cent of samples. Under this temporally separated
evaluation, SyntheFormer achieves a test area under the ROC curve of 0.735 and,
with dual-threshold calibration, attains high-recall screening with 97.6 per
cent recall at 94.2 per cent coverage, which minimizes missed opportunities
while preserving discriminative power. Crucially, the model recovers
experimentally confirmed metastable compounds that lie far from the convex hull
and simultaneously assigns low scores to many thermodynamically stable yet
unsynthesized candidates, demonstrating that stability alone is insufficient to
predict experimental attainability. By aligning structure-aware representation
with uncertainty-aware decision rules, SyntheFormer provides a practical route
to prioritize synthesis targets and focus laboratory effort on the most
promising new inorganic materials.

Abstract: The molecular large language models have garnered widespread attention due to
their promising potential on molecular applications. However, current molecular
large language models face significant limitations in understanding molecules
due to inadequate textual descriptions and suboptimal molecular representation
strategies during pretraining. To address these challenges, we introduce
KnowMol-100K, a large-scale dataset with 100K fine-grained molecular
annotations across multiple levels, bridging the gap between molecules and
textual descriptions. Additionally, we propose chemically-informative molecular
representation, effectively addressing limitations in existing molecular
representation strategies. Building upon these innovations, we develop KnowMol,
a state-of-the-art multi-modal molecular large language model. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that KnowMol achieves superior performance across
molecular understanding and generation tasks.

*Yixuan Florence Wu,Yilun Zhu,Lei Cao and,Naichen Shi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出校准主成分回归(CPCR)方法，通过结合主成分子空间中的低方差先验学习和原始特征空间中的中心化Tikhonov校准，来减轻传统PCR的截断偏差，在过参数化设置中提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主成分回归(PCR)在过参数化情况下通过投影到低维主成分子空间来降低方差，但当真实回归向量在保留主成分之外有质量时会产生截断偏差。需要一种方法来缓解这种偏差。

Method: CPCR首先在主成分子空间中学习低方差先验，然后通过中心化Tikhonov步骤在原始特征空间中对模型进行校准。该方法利用交叉拟合并通过软化PCR的硬截断来控制截断偏差。

Result: 理论分析显示在随机矩阵机制下，当回归信号在低方差方向具有不可忽略分量时，CPCR优于标准PCR。实证结果表明CPCR在多个过参数化问题中一致提升预测性能。

Conclusion: CPCR在现代过参数化设置中展现出稳定性和灵活性，能够有效平衡方差和偏差，提供比传统PCR更好的预测性能。

Abstract: We propose a new method for statistical inference in generalized linear
models. In the overparameterized regime, Principal Component Regression (PCR)
reduces variance by projecting high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional
principal subspace before fitting. However, PCR incurs truncation bias whenever
the true regression vector has mass outside the retained principal components
(PC). To mitigate the bias, we propose Calibrated Principal Component
Regression (CPCR), which first learns a low-variance prior in the PC subspace
and then calibrates the model in the original feature space via a centered
Tikhonov step. CPCR leverages cross-fitting and controls the truncation bias by
softening PCR's hard cutoff. Theoretically, we calculate the out-of-sample risk
in the random matrix regime, which shows that CPCR outperforms standard PCR
when the regression signal has non-negligible components in low-variance
directions. Empirically, CPCR consistently improves prediction across multiple
overparameterized problems. The results highlight CPCR's stability and
flexibility in modern overparameterized settings.

*Archer Dodson,Ritabrata Dutta*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于粗糙路径理论的签名核评分规则，用于评估和训练数据驱动的天气预报模型，能够更好地处理天气数据中的时空相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评分规则（如MSE）忽略了天气和大气系统中高度相关的数据结构，限制了数据驱动天气预报模型的训练和评估效果。

Method: 引入签名核评分规则，将天气变量重新定义为连续路径，通过迭代积分编码时空依赖性；使用路径增强保证唯一性；在WeatherBench 2模型上进行实证评估；使用滑动窗口生成神经网络在ERA5再分析天气数据上进行训练。

Result: 签名核评分规则显示出高判别能力和捕获路径依赖相互作用的独特能力；基于签名核的训练在长达15个时间步的预测路径上优于气候学方法。

Conclusion: 签名核评分规则为天气预报验证和模型训练提供了理论稳健的度量标准，能够有效处理天气数据中的时空相关性。

Abstract: Modern weather forecasting has increasingly transitioned from numerical
weather prediction (NWP) to data-driven machine learning forecasting
techniques. While these new models produce probabilistic forecasts to quantify
uncertainty, their training and evaluation may remain hindered by conventional
scoring rules, primarily MSE, which ignore the highly correlated data
structures present in weather and atmospheric systems. This work introduces the
signature kernel scoring rule, grounded in rough path theory, which reframes
weather variables as continuous paths to encode temporal and spatial
dependencies through iterated integrals. Validated as strictly proper through
the use of path augmentations to guarantee uniqueness, the signature kernel
provides a theoretically robust metric for forecast verification and model
training. Empirical evaluations through weather scorecards on WeatherBench 2
models demonstrate the signature kernel scoring rule's high discriminative
power and unique capacity to capture path-dependent interactions. Following
previous demonstration of successful adversarial-free probabilistic training,
we train sliding window generative neural networks using a
predictive-sequential scoring rule on ERA5 reanalysis weather data. Using a
lightweight model, we demonstrate that signature kernel based training
outperforms climatology for forecast paths of up to fifteen timesteps.

*Kai Chang,Themistoklis P. Sapsis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了极端事件感知学习（η-learning）方法，通过统计正则化在缺乏极端事件数据的情况下预测罕见极端事件，降低模型在极端区域的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化预测罕见极端事件对理解复杂动力系统至关重要，但现有方法需要训练数据中包含多个极端事件，导致在极端区域存在高认知不确定性。

Method: η-learning不假设可用数据中存在极端事件，通过在训练中强制实施指示极端性的可观测量的统计特性，实现统计正则化。

Result: 理论分析基于最优输运提供了严格证明，数值实验在多个原型问题和真实降水降尺度问题上展示了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: η-learning能够在训练数据缺乏极端事件的情况下生成前所未有的极端事件，有效降低模型在极端区域的不确定性。

Abstract: Quantifying and predicting rare and extreme events persists as a crucial yet
challenging task in understanding complex dynamical systems. Many practical
challenges arise from the infrequency and severity of these events, including
the considerable variance of simple sampling methods and the substantial
computational cost of high-fidelity numerical simulations. Numerous data-driven
methods have recently been developed to tackle these challenges. However, a
typical assumption for the success of these methods is the occurrence of
multiple extreme events, either within the training dataset or during the
sampling process. This leads to accurate models in regions of quiescent events
but with high epistemic uncertainty in regions associated with extremes. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce Extreme Event Aware (e2a or eta) or
$\eta$-learning which does not assume the existence of extreme events in the
available data. $\eta$-learning reduces the uncertainty even in `uncharted'
extreme event regions, by enforcing the extreme event statistics of an
observable indicative of extremeness during training, which can be available
through qualitative arguments or estimated with unlabeled data. This type of
statistical regularization results in models that fit the observed data, while
enforcing consistency with the prescribed observable statistics, enabling the
generation of unprecedented extreme events even when the training data lack
extremes therein. Theoretical results based on optimal transport offer a
rigorous justification and highlight the optimality of the introduced method.
Additionally, extensive numerical experiments illustrate the favorable
properties of the $\eta$-learning framework on several prototype problems and
real-world precipitation downscaling problems.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: TDA在聚类货币行为方面比传统统计方法提供更多洞察，能产生更紧凑和分离的聚类，特别是在捕捉货币共变的结构模式方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 外汇市场是复杂系统，具有非线性高维动态，传统统计方法可能无法完全捕捉这些特征，因此研究TDA是否能提供额外洞察。

Method: 使用13种主要货币兑欧元的月度对数收益率，比较基于TDA特征和传统统计特征的聚类结果，应用k-means和层次聚类算法，通过轮廓系数和Calinski-Harabasz指数评估聚类质量。

Result: TDA特征聚类产生更紧凑和分离的聚类，Calinski-Harabasz分数显著更高，但所有方法的轮廓系数都较低，表明聚类外汇时间序列具有固有难度。

Conclusion: TDA是分析金融时间序列的有价值补充工具，特别适用于风险管理中理解结构共变的关键应用。

Abstract: This study investigates whether Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can provide
additional insights beyond traditional statistical methods in clustering
currency behaviours. We focus on the foreign exchange (FX) market, which is a
complex system often exhibiting non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics that
classical techniques may not fully capture. We compare clustering results based
on TDA-derived features versus classical statistical features using monthly
logarithmic returns of 13 major currency exchange rates (all against the euro).
Two widely-used clustering algorithms, \(k\)-means and Hierarchical clustering,
are applied on both types of features, and cluster quality is evaluated via the
Silhouette score and the Calinski-Harabasz index. Our findings show that
TDA-based feature clustering produces more compact and well-separated clusters
than clustering on traditional statistical features, particularly achieving
substantially higher Calinski-Harabasz scores. However, all clustering
approaches yield modest Silhouette scores, underscoring the inherent difficulty
of grouping FX time series. The differing cluster compositions under TDA vs.
classical features suggest that TDA captures structural patterns in currency
co-movements that conventional methods might overlook. These results highlight
TDA as a valuable complementary tool for analysing financial time series, with
potential applications in risk management where understanding structural
co-movements is crucial.

Motivation: 利用大语言模型自动化法律文档分析，特别是合同审查中的关键法律条款检测和标注，以降低合同审查的时间和成本。

Method: 结合公开的CUAD数据集和专有合同数据集，采用鲁棒文本转换、策略性段落选择以及CoT提示和结构化工具调用等LLM特定技术。

Result: 实验结果显示在条款识别准确性和效率方面有显著提升，能够保持高精度的法律条款识别。

Conclusion: 经过精心优化的LLM系统可以成为法律专业人士的有价值工具，为各种规模的组织提供高效的合同审查服务。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models has revolutionized tasks across domains,
including the automation of legal document analysis, a critical component of
modern contract management systems. This paper presents a comprehensive
implementation of LLM-enhanced metadata extraction for contract review,
focusing on the automatic detection and annotation of salient legal clauses.
Leveraging both the publicly available Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset
(CUAD) and proprietary contract datasets, our work demonstrates the integration
of advanced LLM methodologies with practical applications. We identify three
pivotal elements for optimizing metadata extraction: robust text conversion,
strategic chunk selection, and advanced LLM-specific techniques, including
Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting and structured tool calling. The results from
our experiments highlight the substantial improvements in clause identification
accuracy and efficiency. Our approach shows promise in reducing the time and
cost associated with contract review while maintaining high accuracy in legal
clause identification. The results suggest that carefully optimized LLM systems
could serve as valuable tools for legal professionals, potentially increasing
access to efficient contract review services for organizations of all sizes.

TL;DR: 本文研究了具有转移前瞻的强化学习，发现单步前瞻（ℓ=1）可在多项式时间内通过线性规划求解，而两步及以上前瞻（ℓ≥2）则变为NP难问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在强化学习中利用转移前瞻信息（即agent可以观察执行任意ℓ步动作序列后会到达的状态）对性能提升的潜力，以及这种信息使用带来的计算复杂度问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的线性规划公式来解决单步前瞻（ℓ=1）的最优规划问题，并分析了多步前瞻（ℓ≥2）的计算复杂度。

Result: 证明了单步前瞻规划可在多项式时间内求解，而两步及以上前瞻规划是NP难问题。

Conclusion: 研究结果精确划定了在强化学习中利用转移前瞻进行规划时，可处理情况和难处理情况之间的边界。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) with transition look-ahead, where the
agent may observe which states would be visited upon playing any sequence of
$\ell$ actions before deciding its course of action. While such predictive
information can drastically improve the achievable performance, we show that
using this information optimally comes at a potentially prohibitive
computational cost. Specifically, we prove that optimal planning with one-step
look-ahead ($\ell=1$) can be solved in polynomial time through a novel linear
programming formulation. In contrast, for $\ell \geq 2$, the problem becomes
NP-hard. Our results delineate a precise boundary between tractable and
intractable cases for the problem of planning with transition look-ahead in
reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进Cox比例风险模型和LASSO在生存分析中的特征选择性能，超越传统的交叉验证或BIC方法。

Method: 采用基于Cox部分似然函数平方根的LASSO方法，直接调整惩罚参数λ进行特征选择，该方法具有渐近枢轴性，并可应用于线性模型和人工神经网络。

Result: 该方法在检索所有且仅有好特征的概率上表现出相变行为，显著优于交叉验证LASSO和BIC子集选择方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在生存分析特征选择方面具有优越性能，能够像压缩感知一样实现特征选择的相变行为，且适用于多种模型架构。

Abstract: We revisit Cox's proportional hazard models and LASSO in the aim of improving
feature selection in survival analysis. Unlike traditional methods relying on
cross-validation or BIC, the penalty parameter $\lambda$ is directly tuned for
feature selection and is asymptotically pivotal thanks to taking the square
root of Cox's partial likelihood. Substantially improving over both
cross-validation LASSO and BIC subset selection, our approach has a phase
transition on the probability of retrieving all and only the good features,
like in compressed sensing. The method can be employed by linear models but
also by artificial neural networks.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了神经网络中特征学习的结构发现，在更弱假设下证明了任意大小和深度的神经网络在达到二阶稳定点时能够发现低秩结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解神经网络特征学习的动态性是一个重要挑战。先前工作(Mousavi-Hosseini et al., 2023)在强正则化条件下分析了两层学生网络，本工作旨在在更弱假设下研究结构发现问题。

Method: 使用去随机化引理，该引理表明在温和条件下优化函数𝔼[gθ(Wx+b)]会收敛到W=0的点。允许任意大小和深度的神经网络、所有参数可训练、任何平滑损失函数、微小正则化，以及任何达到二阶稳定点的训练方法。

Result: 证明了在更一般条件下神经网络能够发现低秩结构，该结果具有广泛适用性，包括MAXCUT的端到端近似和计算Johnson-Lindenstrauss嵌入等应用。

Conclusion: 去随机化引理从根本上解释了结构发现现象，并为理解神经网络特征学习提供了新的理论框架，在多个领域具有直接应用价值。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of feature learning in neural networks (NNs)
remains a significant challenge. The work of (Mousavi-Hosseini et al., 2023)
analyzes a multiple index teacher-student setting and shows that a two-layer
student attains a low-rank structure in its first-layer weights when trained
with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and a strong regularizer. This
structural property is known to reduce sample complexity of generalization.
Indeed, in a second step, the same authors establish algorithm-specific
learning guarantees under additional assumptions. In this paper, we focus
exclusively on the structure discovery aspect and study it under weaker
assumptions, more specifically: we allow (a) NNs of arbitrary size and depth,
(b) with all parameters trainable, (c) under any smooth loss function, (d) tiny
regularization, and (e) trained by any method that attains a second-order
stationary point (SOSP), e.g.\ perturbed gradient descent (PGD). At the core of
our approach is a key $\textit{derandomization}$ lemma, which states that
optimizing the function $\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}}
\left[g_{\theta}(\mathbf{W}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b})\right]$ converges to a
point where $\mathbf{W} = \mathbf{0}$, under mild conditions. The fundamental
nature of this lemma directly explains structure discovery and has immediate
applications in other domains including an end-to-end approximation for MAXCUT,
and computing Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线数据如何有效加速在线强化学习这一具有潜力但缺乏理论支撑的基础问题，特别是如何学习和应用价值包络。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用离线数据推导价值函数的上界和下界；第二阶段将这些学习到的边界整合到在线算法中。通过解耦上下界实现更灵活和紧密的近似。

Result: 在表格MDP上的实证结果表明，相比UCBVI和先前方法，该方法能显著降低遗憾。

Conclusion: 该方法为离线预训练和在线微调之间建立了正式桥梁，通过可解释的遗憾界限提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We investigate the fundamental problem of leveraging offline data to
accelerate online reinforcement learning - a direction with strong potential
but limited theoretical grounding. Our study centers on how to learn and apply
value envelopes within this context. To this end, we introduce a principled
two-stage framework: the first stage uses offline data to derive upper and
lower bounds on value functions, while the second incorporates these learned
bounds into online algorithms. Our method extends prior work by decoupling the
upper and lower bounds, enabling more flexible and tighter approximations. In
contrast to approaches that rely on fixed shaping functions, our envelopes are
data-driven and explicitly modeled as random variables, with a filtration
argument ensuring independence across phases. The analysis establishes
high-probability regret bounds determined by two interpretable quantities,
thereby providing a formal bridge between offline pre-training and online
fine-tuning. Empirical results on tabular MDPs demonstrate substantial regret
reductions compared with both UCBVI and prior methods.

TL;DR: LAPRAD是一种利用LLM辅助发现协议漏洞的方法，成功发现了三种新的DNS DDoS攻击，这些攻击能够绕过现有补丁并显著降低解析器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高互联网协议安全性，开发更快、半自动的方法来发现DNS、BGP等协议中的新漏洞。

Method: 三阶段流程：1) 使用GPT-o1识别潜在攻击；2) 使用不同LLM通过ReACT方法自动构建攻击配置；3) 验证攻击功能性和有效性。

Result: 发现了三种新的DNS DDoS攻击：诱饵切换技术缓存虚假DNSSEC RRSIGs、利用大型DNSSEC加密算法绕过RRSet限制、利用ANY类型响应。这些攻击能将解析器服务能力降至6%。

Conclusion: LAPRAD方法有效发现了新的DNS协议漏洞，这些SigCacheFlush攻击变种能够绕过现有补丁，严重影响主流DNS解析器实现的最新版本。

Abstract: With the goal of improving the security of Internet protocols, we seek
faster, semi-automatic methods to discover new vulnerabilities in protocols
such as DNS, BGP, and others. To this end, we introduce the LLM-Assisted
Protocol Attack Discovery (LAPRAD) methodology, enabling security researchers
with some DNS knowledge to efficiently uncover vulnerabilities that would
otherwise be hard to detect.
  LAPRAD follows a three-stage process. In the first, we consult an LLM
(GPT-o1) that has been trained on a broad corpus of DNS-related sources and
previous DDoS attacks to identify potential exploits. In the second stage, a
different LLM automatically constructs the corresponding attack configurations
using the ReACT approach implemented via LangChain (DNS zone file generation).
Finally, in the third stage, we validate the attack's functionality and
effectiveness.
  Using LAPRAD, we uncovered three new DDoS attacks on the DNS protocol and
rediscovered two recently reported ones that were not included in the LLM's
training data. The first new attack employs a bait-and-switch technique to
trick resolvers into caching large, bogus DNSSEC RRSIGs, reducing their serving
capacity to as little as 6%. The second exploits large DNSSEC encryption
algorithms (RSA-4096) with multiple keys, thereby bypassing a recently
implemented default RRSet limit. The third leverages ANY-type responses to
produce a similar effect.
  These variations of a cache-flushing DDoS attack, called SigCacheFlush,
circumvent existing patches, severely degrade resolver query capacity, and
impact the latest versions of major DNS resolver implementations.

TL;DR: HAMLOCK是一种新型硬件-软件联合后门攻击，通过将攻击逻辑分布在硬件和软件边界，实现比传统模型级后门攻击更隐蔽的威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型级后门攻击容易被检测，因为整个攻击逻辑都嵌入在模型中，存在可追踪的逐层激活路径。需要开发更隐蔽的攻击方式。

Method: 软件层面仅微调少量神经元的激活值，在触发条件出现时产生独特的高激活值。恶意硬件木马通过监控相应神经元的最重要位或8位指数来检测这些独特激活，并触发另一个硬件木马直接操纵最终输出logits实现误分类。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10、GTSRB和ImageNet等基准测试中，HAMLOCK实现了接近完美的攻击成功率，且对清洁准确率影响极小。能够规避最先进的模型级防御，硬件木马面积和功耗开销仅为0.01%。

Conclusion: HAMLOCK暴露了硬件-软件接口的关键漏洞，需要开发新的跨层防御来应对这种新兴威胁。

Abstract: The growing use of third-party hardware accelerators (e.g., FPGAs, ASICs) for
deep neural networks (DNNs) introduces new security vulnerabilities.
Conventional model-level backdoor attacks, which only poison a model's weights
to misclassify inputs with a specific trigger, are often detectable because the
entire attack logic is embedded within the model (i.e., software), creating a
traceable layer-by-layer activation path.
  This paper introduces the HArdware-Model Logically Combined Attack (HAMLOCK),
a far stealthier threat that distributes the attack logic across the
hardware-software boundary. The software (model) is now only minimally altered
by tuning the activations of few neurons to produce uniquely high activation
values when a trigger is present. A malicious hardware Trojan detects those
unique activations by monitoring the corresponding neurons' most significant
bit or the 8-bit exponents and triggers another hardware Trojan to directly
manipulate the final output logits for misclassification.
  This decoupled design is highly stealthy, as the model itself contains no
complete backdoor activation path as in conventional attacks and hence, appears
fully benign. Empirically, across benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet, HAMLOCK achieves a near-perfect attack success rate with a negligible
clean accuracy drop. More importantly, HAMLOCK circumvents the state-of-the-art
model-level defenses without any adaptive optimization. The hardware Trojan is
also undetectable, incurring area and power overheads as low as 0.01%, which is
easily masked by process and environmental noise. Our findings expose a
critical vulnerability at the hardware-software interface, demanding new
cross-layer defenses against this emerging threat.

Abstract: As the volume of stored data continues to grow, identifying and protecting
sensitive information within large repositories becomes increasingly
challenging, especially when shared with multiple users with different roles
and permissions. This work presents a system architecture for trusted data
sharing with policy-driven access control, enabling selective protection of
sensitive regions while maintaining scalability. The proposed architecture
integrates four core modules that combine automated detection of sensitive
regions, post-correction, key management, and access control. Sensitive regions
are secured using a hybrid scheme that employs symmetric encryption for
efficiency and Attribute-Based Encryption for policy enforcement. The system
supports efficient key distribution and isolates key storage to strengthen
overall security. To demonstrate its applicability, we evaluate the system on
visual datasets, where Privacy-Sensitive Objects in images are automatically
detected, reassessed, and selectively encrypted prior to sharing in a data
repository. Experimental results show that our system provides effective PSO
detection, increases macro-averaged F1 score (5%) and mean Average Precision
(10%), and maintains an average policy-enforced decryption time of less than 1
second per image. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and
scalability of our proposed solution for fine-grained access control.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have become a
popular paradigm of AI applications. However, trustworthiness issues in MAS
remain a critical concern. Unlike challenges in single-agent systems, MAS
involve more complex communication processes, making them susceptible to
corruption attacks. To mitigate this issue, several defense mechanisms have
been developed based on the graph representation of MAS, where agents represent
nodes and communications form edges. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly
focus on static graph defense, attempting to either detect attacks in a fixed
graph structure or optimize a static topology with certain defensive
capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic defense paradigm
for MAS graph structures, which continuously monitors communication within the
MAS graph, then dynamically adjusts the graph topology, accurately disrupts
malicious communications, and effectively defends against evolving and diverse
dynamic attacks. Experimental results in increasingly complex and dynamic MAS
environments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MAS
defense mechanisms, contributing an effective guardrail for their trustworthy
applications. Our code is available at

Result: 在NIDS领域，增加层数不仅不会提高性能，反而会显著降低对抗攻击的鲁棒性；而在计算机视觉领域，增加层数对鲁棒性的影响较为温和。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges to Machine Learning (ML)
systems and especially Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by subtly manipulating
inputs to induce incorrect predictions. This paper investigates whether
increasing the layer depth of deep neural networks affects their robustness
against adversarial attacks in the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
domain. We compare the adversarial robustness of various deep neural networks
across both \ac{NIDS} and computer vision domains (the latter being widely used
in adversarial attack experiments). Our experimental results reveal that in the
NIDS domain, adding more layers does not necessarily improve their performance,
yet it may actually significantly degrade their robustness against adversarial
attacks. Conversely, in the computer vision domain, adding more layers exhibits
a more modest impact on robustness. These findings can guide the development of
robust neural networks for (NIDS) applications and highlight the unique
characteristics of network security domains within the (ML) landscape.

Abstract: The financial market is known to be highly sensitive to news. Therefore,
effectively incorporating news data into quantitative trading remains an
important challenge. Existing approaches typically rely on manually designed
rules and/or handcrafted features. In this work, we directly use the news
sentiment scores derived from large language models, together with raw price
and volume data, as observable inputs for reinforcement learning. These inputs
are processed by sequence models such as recurrent neural networks or
Transformers to make end-to-end trading decisions. We conduct experiments using
the cryptocurrency market as an example and evaluate two representative
reinforcement learning algorithms, namely Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) and
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The results demonstrate that our
news-aware approach, which does not depend on handcrafted features or manually
designed rules, can achieve performance superior to market benchmarks. We
further highlight the critical role of time-series information in this process.
