However, their tendency to generate executable SQL for ambiguous, out-of-scope, or unanswerable queries introduces a hidden risk, as outputs may be misinterpreted as correct. This risk is especially serious in biomedical contexts, where precision is critical. We therefore present Query Carefully, a pipeline that integrates LLM-based SQL generation with explicit detection and handling of unanswerable inputs. Building on the OncoMX component of ScienceBenchmark, we construct OncoMX-NAQ (No-Answer Questions), a set of 80 no-answer questions spanning 8 categories (non-SQL, out-of-schema/domain, and multiple ambiguity types). Our approach employs llama3.3:70b with schema-aware prompts, explicit No-Answer Rules (NAR), and few-shot examples drawn from both answerable and unanswerable questions. We evaluate SQL exact match, result accuracy, and unanswerable-detection accuracy. On the OncoMX dev split, few-shot prompting with answerable examples increases result accuracy, and adding unanswerable examples does not degrade performance. On OncoMX-NAQ, balanced prompting achieves the highest unanswerable-detection accuracy (0.8), with near-perfect results for structurally defined categories (non-SQL, missing columns, out-of-domain) but persistent challenges for missing-value queries (0.5) and column ambiguity (0.3). A lightweight user interface surfaces interim SQL, execution results, and abstentions, supporting transparent and reliable text-to-SQL in biomedical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faQuery Carefully\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u751f\u6210SQL\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u67e5\u8be2\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u6784\u5efaOncoMX-NAQ\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7schema\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u548cNo-Answer Rules\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u5230SQL\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230SQL\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u8d85\u51fa\u8303\u56f4\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u4ecd\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6267\u884cSQL\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u5224\u4e3a\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5c24\u5176\u5371\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528llama3.3:70b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408schema\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u660e\u786e\u7684No-Answer Rules\u548c\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u6784\u5efaOncoMX-NAQ\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0880\u4e2a\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6db5\u76d68\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728OncoMX\u5f00\u53d1\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ed3\u679c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5728OncoMX-NAQ\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u63d0\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad8\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff080.8\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u67e5\u8be2\uff080.5\uff09\u548c\u5217\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff080.3\uff09\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "Query Carefully\u7ba1\u9053\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u5230SQL\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u5c55\u793a\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u4fe1\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002"}}

We first give a construction for answering arbitrary workloads of weighted marginal queries, over arbitrary domains. Our technique is based on releasing queries in the Fourier basis with independent noise with carefully calibrated variances, and reconstructing the marginal query answers using the inverse Fourier transform. We show that our algorithm, which is a factorization mechanism, is exactly optimal among all factorization mechanisms, both for minimizing the sum of weighted noise variances, and for minimizing the maximum noise variance. Unlike algorithms based on optimizing over all factorization mechanisms via semidefinite programming, our mechanism runs in time polynomial in the dataset and the output size. This construction recovers results of Xiao et al. [Neurips 2023] with a simpler algorithm and optimality proof, and a better running time.\n  We then extend our approach to a generalization of marginals which we refer to as product queries. We show that our algorithm is still exactly optimal for this more general class of queries. Finally, we show how to embed extended marginal queries, which allow using a threshold predicate on numerical attributes, into product queries.

Accurately predicting the RSRP can help network operators perceive user experiences and maximize throughput by optimizing wireless resources. However, existing research into RSRP prediction has limitations in accuracy and verisimilitude. Theoretical derivations and existing data-driven methods consider only easily quantifiable Large-Scale (LS) information, and struggle to effectively capture the intertwined LS and Small-Scale (SS) signal attenuation characteristics of the wireless channel. Moreover, the lack of prior physical knowledge leads to weak accuracy, interpretability, and transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel RSRP prediction framework, Channel-Diff. This framework physically models LS and SS attenuation using multimodal conditions and employs physics-informed conditional diffusion models as the prediction network. Channel-Diff extracts prior physical information that characterises the signal propagation process from network parameters and multi-attribute maps of the urban spatial environment. It provides LS physical priors through large-scale propagation modelling and shadow-occlusion modelling, and SS physical priors through multipath propagation modelling and urban microenvironment feature extraction.

By leveraging neural networks to learn complex Bloch functions and their associated eigenvalues (energies) simultaneously, we develop a mesh-free solver enforcing the governing Schr\u00f6dinger equation, Bloch periodicity, and normalization constraints through a composite loss function without supervision. The model is trained over the Brillouin zone to recover band structures and Bloch modes, with numerical validation against traditional plane-wave expansion methods. We further explore transfer learning techniques to adapt the solver from nearly-free electron potentials to strongly varying potentials, demonstrating its ability to capture changes in band structure topology.

Recognizing fairness explicitly as a software quality dimension yields practical benefits beyond ethical considerations, notably improved predictive performance for unprivileged groups, enhanced out-of-distribution generalization, and increased geographic transferability in real-world deployments. Nevertheless, existing bias mitigation methods face a critical dilemma: while pre-processing methods offer broad applicability across model types, they generally fall short in effectiveness compared to post-processing techniques. To overcome this challenge, we propose Correlation Tuning (CoT), a novel pre-processing approach designed to mitigate bias by adjusting data correlations. Specifically, CoT introduces the Phi-coefficient, an intuitive correlation measure, to systematically quantify correlation between sensitive attributes and labels, and employs multi-objective optimization to address the proxy biases. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CoT increases the true positive rate of unprivileged groups by an average of 17.5% and reduces three key bias metrics, including statistical parity difference (SPD), average odds difference (AOD), and equal opportunity difference (EOD), by more than 50% on average. CoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by three and ten percentage points in single attribute and multiple attributes scenarios, respectively. We will publicly release our experimental results and source code to facilitate future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u654f\u611f\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5c06\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u660e\u786e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u4f26\u7406\u8003\u91cf\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u5b9e\u9645\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u5982\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5730\u7406\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5e7f\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u5982\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCorrelation Tuning (CoT)\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u5f15\u5165Phi\u7cfb\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u5904\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "CoT\u5c06\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u771f\u9633\u6027\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad817.5%\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u504f\u89c1\u6307\u6807\uff08SPD\u3001AOD\u3001EOD\uff09\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e50%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u5728\u5355\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u51fa3\u4e2a\u548c10\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "CoT\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, the heterogeneity of TN and NTN introduces complex architectural challenges that complicate MC implementation. Specifically, the diversity of link types, spanning air-to-air, air-to-space, space-to-space, space-to-ground, and ground-to-ground communications, renders optimal resource allocation highly complex. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) have shown remarkable effectiveness in optimal decision-making in complex and dynamic environments. In this paper, we review the current developments in SAGIN-enabled MC and outline the key challenges associated with its implementation. We further highlight the transformative potential of AI-driven approaches for resource optimization in a heterogeneous SAGIN environment. To this end, we present a case study on resource allocation optimization enabled by agentic RL for SAGIN-enabled MC involving diverse radio access technologies (RATs).

Yet, state-of-the-art generative models often require large datasets and complex training procedures, limiting their applicability in small-sample settings. In this work, we reframe SDG as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and introduce RLSyn, a novel framework that models the data generator as a stochastic policy over patient records and optimizes it using Proximal Policy Optimization with discriminator-derived rewards, yielding more stable and data-efficient training. We evaluate RLSyn on two biomedical datasets - AI-READI and MIMIC-IV- and benchmark it against state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion-based methods across extensive privacy, utility, and fidelity evaluations. RL-Syn performs comparably to diffusion models and outperforms GANs on MIMIC-IV, while outperforming both diffusion models and GANs on the smaller AI-READI dataset. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning provides a principled and effective alternative for synthetic biomedical data generation, particularly in data-scarce regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLSyn\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528PPO\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u60a3\u8005\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRLSyn\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u60a3\u8005\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5224\u522b\u5668\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPO\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728AI-READI\u548cMIMIC-IV\u4e24\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1aRLSyn\u5728MIMIC-IV\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8eGANs\uff0c\u5728\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684AI-READI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548cGANs\u3002\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Inspired by anthropological aspects of human evolution, such as natural selection and adaptation in early hominids, CosmoCore-Evo treats RL trajectories as ``genomes'' that undergo mutation and selection during the nocturnal replay phase. This mechanism allows agents to break free from trained patterns, fostering emergent behaviors and improved performance in distribution-shifted environments, such as changing APIs or novel libraries. We augment the Dream Queue with evolutionary operations, including mutation of high-fitness trajectories and enterprise-tuned fitness functions that incorporate efficiency, compliance, and scalability metrics. Evaluated on extended benchmarks including HumanEval variants with shifts, BigCodeBench, and a custom PySpark pipeline simulation, CosmoCore-Evo achieves up to 35% higher novelty in solutions and 25% faster adaptation compared to the original CosmoCore and baselines like PPO and REAMER.

To address these limitations, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handovers (CHOs) that enable proactive cell reservations and user-driven execution. However, both handover (HO) types present intricate trade-offs in signaling, resource usage, and reliability. This paper presents unique, countrywide mobility management datasets from a top-tier mobile network operator (MNO) that offer fresh insights into these issues and call for adaptive and robust HO control in next-generation networks. Motivated by these findings, we propose CONTRA, a framework that, for the first time, jointly optimizes THOs and CHOs within the O-RAN architecture. We study two variants of CONTRA: one where users are a priori assigned to one of the HO types, reflecting distinct service or user-specific requirements, as well as a more dynamic formulation where the controller decides on-the-fly the HO type, based on system conditions and needs. To this end, it relies on a practical meta-learning algorithm that adapts to runtime observations and guarantees performance comparable to an oracle with perfect future information (universal no-regret). CONTRA is specifically designed for near-real-time deployment as an O-RAN xApp and aligns with the 6G goals of flexible and intelligent control.

While modern GPUs provide specialised Matrix-Multiply-Accumulate (MMA) units, e.g., Tensor Cores (TC), with extremely high throughput, they target dense operations, making it non-trivial to exploit them for irregular, unstructured graph computations. In particular, fully utilising them for a BFS requires an efficient mapping of the edge operations onto TCs while avoiding redundancy, load imbalance, and synchronisation. We present BLEST, a TC-accelerated framework that reformulates the pull-based BFS pipeline around a bitmap-oriented structure and a carefully engineered execution layout. BLEST introduces Binarised Virtual Slice Sets (BVSS) to enforce warp-level load balancing and to eliminate frontier-oblivious work assignment. To improve both memory efficiency and update locality across diverse graphs, we apply two complementary graph reordering strategies: a compression-oriented ordering for social-like graphs and a bandwidth-reducing ordering for non-social graphs. At the compute level, we develop a batched SpMSpV multiplication pattern that uses the bitwise TC tiles to handle dot products without wasting output entries, thereby reducing the number of required MMA calls. Finally, BLEST combines kernel fusion with a lazy vertex update scheme to reduce host-side synchronisation, mitigate atomic overheads, and improve cache locality.

We propose a multi-agent committee framework in which diverse vision-enabled LLMs collaborate through a three-round voting protocol to reach consensus on testing actions. The framework combines model diversity, persona-driven behavioral variation, and visual user interface understanding to systematically explore web applications. Across 84 experimental runs with 9 testing personas and 4 scenarios, multi-agent committees achieve an 89.5 percent overall task success rate. Configurations with 2 to 4 agents reach 91.7 to 100 percent success, compared to 78.0 percent for single-agent baselines, yielding improvements of 13.7 to 22.0 percentage points. At the action level, the system attains a 93.1 percent success rate with a median per-action latency of 0.71 seconds, enabling real-time and continuous integration testing. Vision-enabled agents successfully identify user interface elements, with navigation and reporting achieving 100 percent success and form filling achieving 99.2 percent success. We evaluate the framework on WebShop and OWASP benchmarks, achieving 74.7 percent success on WebShop compared to a 50.1 percent published GPT-3 baseline, and 82.0 percent success on OWASP Juice Shop security testing with coverage of 8 of the 10 OWASP Top 10 vulnerability categories. Across 20 injected regressions, the committee achieves an F1 score of 0.91 for bug detection, compared to 0.78 for single-agent baselines.

In the proposed method, each LoRa End Device (ED) employs the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)1-tuned algorithm to select transmission parameters including channel, transmission power, and bandwidth. The transmission parameters are selected based on the acknowledgment (ACK) feedback returned from the gateway after each transmission and the corresponding transmission energy consumption. Hence, it enables devices to simultaneously optimize transmission success rate and energy efficiency in a fully distributed manner. However, although UCB1-tuned based method is effective under stationary conditions, it suffers from slow adaptation in dynamic environments due to its strong reliance on historical observations. To address this limitation, we integrate the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC) to our proposed method. SIC is adopted because it enables low-cost detection of changes in the communication environment, making it suitable for implementation on resource-constrained LoRa EDs. When a change is detected by SIC, the learning history of UCB1-tuned is reset, allowing rapid re-learning under the new conditions.

We present nncase, an open-source, end-to-end compilation framework designed to unify optimization across diverse targets. Central to nncase is an e-graph-based term rewriting engine that mitigates the phase ordering problem, enabling global exploration of computation and data movement strategies. The framework integrates three key modules: Auto Vectorize for adapting to heterogeneous computing units, Auto Distribution for searching parallel strategies with cost-aware communication optimization, and Auto Schedule for maximizing on-chip cache locality. Furthermore, a buffer-aware Codegen phase ensures efficient kernel instantiation. Evaluations show that nncase outperforms mainstream frameworks like MLC LLM and Intel IPEX on Qwen3 series models and achieves performance comparable to the hand-optimized llama.cpp on CPUs, demonstrating the viability of automated compilation for high-performance LLM deployment.

Motivated by this gap, this survey examines RL specifically through the lens of AoI and generalized freshness optimization. We organize AoI and its variants into native, function-based, and application-oriented families, providing a clearer view of how freshness should be modeled in B5G and 6G systems. Building on this foundation, we introduce a policy-centric taxonomy that reflects the decisions most relevant to freshness, consisting of update-control RL, medium-access RL, risk-sensitive RL, and multi-agent RL. This structure provides a coherent framework for understanding how learning can support sampling, scheduling, trajectory planning, medium access, and distributed coordination. We further synthesize recent progress in RL-driven freshness control and highlight open challenges related to delayed decision processes, stochastic variability, and cross-layer design. The goal is to establish a unified foundation for learning-based freshness optimization in next-generation wireless networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u8bba\u6587\u4e13\u95e8\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u5e74\u9f84(AoI)\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u6570\u636e\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3aB5G/6G\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8981\u4e48\u5173\u6ce8\u7ecf\u5178AoI\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8ba8\u8bba\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u5206\u6790\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5c06AoI\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u539f\u751f\u578b\u3001\u51fd\u6570\u578b\u548c\u9762\u5411\u5e94\u7528\u578b\u4e09\u7c7b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u66f4\u65b0\u63a7\u5236RL\u3001\u5a92\u4f53\u63a5\u5165RL\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611fRL\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53RL\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u652f\u6301\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86AoI\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u4e86RL\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e3aB5G\u548c6G\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002"}}

We present a proof-of-concept smart IoT monitoring system combining LSTM neural networks for probabilistic leak forecasting with Random Forest classifiers for instant detection. Testing on synthetic data aligned with ASHRAE 2021 standards, our approach achieves 96.5% detection accuracy and 87% forecasting accuracy at 90% probability within plus or minus 30-minute windows. Analysis demonstrates that humidity, pressure, and flow rate deliver strong predictive signals, while temperature exhibits minimal immediate response due to thermal inertia in server hardware.

However, due to the huge size of embedding tables, typical DLRM training frameworks adopt one or more parameter servers to maintain global embedding tables, while leveraging the edge workers cache part of them. This incurs significant transmission cost for embedding transmissions between workers and parameter servers, which can dominate the training cycle. In this paper, we investigate how to dispatch input embedding samples to appropriate edge workers to minimize the total embedding transmission cost when facing edge-specific challenges such as heterogeneous networks and limited resources. We develop ESD, a novel mechanism that optimizes the dispatch of input embedding samples to edge workers based on expected embedding transmission cost. We propose HybridDis as the dispatch decision method within ESD, which combines a resource-intensive optimal algorithm and a heuristic algorithm to balance decision quality and resource consumption. We implement a prototype of ESD and compare it with state-of-the-art mechanisms on real-world workloads. Extensive experimental results show that ESD reduces the embedding transmission cost by up to 36.76% and achieves up to 1.74 times speedup in end-to-end DLRM training.", "AI": {"tldr": "ESD\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\u5230\u8fb9\u7f18\u5de5\u4f5c\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5d4c\u5165\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u52a0\u901fDLRM\u8bad\u7ec3", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f20\u8f93\u5f00\u9500\u5927", "method": "\u63d0\u51faESD\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528HybridDis\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017", "result": "ESD\u51cf\u5c11\u5d4c\u5165\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe36.76%\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aefDLRM\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u901f\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe1.74\u500d", "conclusion": "ESD\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2dDLRM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02"}}

Nevertheless, assessing data quality post-compression remains computationally expensive due to the intensive nature of metric calculations. In this work, we present a general-purpose deep-surrogate framework for lossy compression quality prediction (DeepCQ), with the following key contributions: 1) We develop a surrogate model for compression quality prediction that is generalizable to different error-bounded lossy compressors, quality metrics, and input datasets; 2) We adopt a novel two-stage design that decouples the computationally expensive feature-extraction stage from the light-weight metrics prediction, enabling efficient training and modular inference; 3) We optimize the model performance on time-evolving data using a mixture-of-experts design. Such a design enhances the robustness when predicting across simulation timesteps, especially when the training and test data exhibit significant variation. We validate the effectiveness of DeepCQ on four real-world scientific applications. Our results highlight the framework's exceptional predictive accuracy, with prediction errors generally under 10\\% across most settings, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Developers can write a Github issue and assign it to an AI-agent like Copilot for implementation. Based on the issue and its related discussion, the AI-agent performs a plan for the implementation, and executes it. However, the performance of AI-agents and LLMs heavily depends on the input they receive. For instance, a GitHub issue that is unclear or not well scoped might not lead to a successful implementation that will eventually be merged. GitHub Copilot provides a set of best practice recommendations that are limited and high-level. In this paper, we build a set of 32 detailed criteria that we leverage to measure the quality of GitHub issues to make them suitable for AI-agents. We compare the GitHub issues that lead to a merged pull request versus closed pull request. Then, we build an interpretable machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a GitHub issue resulting in a merged pull request. We observe that pull requests that end up being merged are those originating from issues that are shorter, well scoped, with clear guidance and hints about the relevant artifacts for an issue, and with guidance on how to perform the implementation. Issues with external references including configuration, context setup, dependencies or external APIs are associated with lower merge rates. We built an interpretable machine learning model to help users identify how to improve a GitHub issue to increase the chances of the issue resulting in a merged pull request by Copilot.

Recently, a distributed system called PETALS was developed to lower the barrier for deploying LLMs by splitting the model blocks across multiple servers with low-end GPUs distributed over the Internet, which was much faster than swapping the model parameters between the GPU memory and other cheaper but slower local storage media. However, the performance of such a distributed system critically depends on the resource allocation, and how to do so optimally remains unknown. In this work, we present the first systematic study of the resource allocation problem in distributed LLM inference, with focus on two important decisions: block placement and request routing. Our main results include: experimentally validated performance models that can predict the inference performance under given block placement and request routing decisions, a formulation of the offline optimization of block placement and request routing as a mixed integer linear programming problem together with the NP-hardness proof and a polynomial-complexity algorithm with guaranteed performance, and an adaptation of the offline algorithm for the online setting with the same performance guarantee under bounded load. Through both experiments and experimentally-validated simulations, we have verified that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the inference time compared to the state-of-the-art solution in diverse settings with geographically-distributed servers. As a byproduct, we have also developed a light-weighted CPU-only simulator capable of predicting the performance of distributed LLM inference on GPU servers, which can evaluate large deployments and facilitate future research for researchers with limited GPU access.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fLLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136PETALS\u7b49\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u5982\u4f55\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u914d\u4ecd\u672a\u77e5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5757\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u8bf7\u6c42\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u5efa\u7acb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u5c06\u5757\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u8bf7\u6c42\u8def\u7531\u79bb\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176NP-hard\u6027\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b3) \u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b4) \u5f00\u53d1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CPU\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u7684CPU\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4bGPU\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fLLM\u63a8\u7406\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present Hyperion, the first cloud-device collaborative framework that enables low-latency inference on Ultra-HD vision data using off-the-shelf vision transformers over dynamic networks. Hyperion addresses the computational and transmission bottleneck of Ultra-HD vision transformers by exploiting the intrinsic property in vision Transformer models. Specifically, Hyperion integrates a collaboration-aware importance scorer that identifies critical regions at the patch level, a dynamic scheduler that adaptively adjusts patch transmission quality to balance latency and accuracy under dynamic network conditions, and a weighted ensembler that fuses edge and cloud results to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyperion enhances frame processing rate by up to 1.61 times and improves the accuracy by up to 20.2% when compared with state-of-the-art baselines under various network environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hyperion\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e91-\u7aef\u534f\u540c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u8d85\u9ad8\u6e05\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f20\u8f93\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u52a0\u6743\u878d\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u9ad8\u6e05\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u74f6\u9888\uff1a\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5904\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4e91\u7aef\u5904\u7406\u4f20\u8f93\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "1. \u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\uff1a\u5728patch\u7ea7\u522b\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\uff1b2. \u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff1a\u6839\u636e\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574patch\u4f20\u8f93\u8d28\u91cf\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b3. \u52a0\u6743\u96c6\u6210\u5668\uff1a\u878d\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u4e91\u7aef\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHyperion\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e27\u5904\u7406\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe1.61\u500d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe20.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "Hyperion\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8d85\u9ad8\u6e05\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e91-\u7aef\u534f\u540c\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

As a result, their sampling speeds are often comparable to AR + speculative decoding schemes, limiting their advantage over mainstream autoregressive approaches. Existing distillation-based accelerators (dParallel, d3LLM) finetune MDLMs on trajectories generated by a base model, which can become off-policy during finetuning and restrict performance to the quality of the base model's samples. We propose \\texttt{dUltra}, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that learns unmasking strategies for efficient parallel decoding. dUltra introduces an unmasking planner head that predicts per-token unmasking likelihoods under independent Bernoulli distributions. We jointly optimize the base diffusion LLM and the unmasking order planner using reward signals combining verifiable reward, distillation reward, and the number of unmasking steps. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks, dUltra improves the accuracy--efficiency trade-off over state-of-the-art heuristic and distillation baselines, moving towards achieving ``diffusion supremacy'' over autoregressive models.", "AI": {"tldr": "dUltra\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u53bb\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MDLMs\uff09\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u5c11\u4e8e5\u4e2atoken\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b+\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fadUltra\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u53bb\u63a9\u7801\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5934\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u4f2f\u52aa\u5229\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u53bb\u63a9\u7801\u6982\u7387\u3002\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u6269\u6563LLM\u548c\u53bb\u63a9\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u84b8\u998f\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u53bb\u63a9\u7801\u6b65\u9aa4\u6570\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cdUltra\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u671d\u7740\u5b9e\u73b0\"\u6269\u6563\u4f18\u52bf\"\uff08\u8d85\u8d8a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u8fc8\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "dUltra\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u53bb\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, their massive parameter scales and substantial resource demands pose critical challenges for efficient inference on edge devices. These devices are inherently constrained by limited computational power and memory capacity, while bandwidth bottlenecks at the network edge further restrict distributed deployment and real-time responsiveness. Although existing research has explored lightweight optimization techniques to mitigate memory limitations, such approaches often incur significant degradation in model accuracy and performance. To address these challenges, we propose LIME, a collaborative system that enables lossless inference for large models across multiple memory-constrained edge devices under limited network bandwidth. LIME employs an interleaved pipeline parallelism in conjunction with model offloading to dynamically balance computation and communication. Furthermore, a fine-grained offline allocation scheduler and online memory adaptation strategy are introduced to enhance the device's computing and storage resources while minimizing inference latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIME, deployed on four heterogeneous Nvidia Jetson edge devices for LLaMA3.3-70B-Instruct model inference, achieves 1.7$\\times$ and 3.7$\\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art baselines under sporadic and bursty request patterns respectively, without compromising model accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "LIME\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u635f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u9519\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5e76\u884c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5378\u8f7d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7f51\u7edc\u5e26\u5bbd\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u5de8\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u5e9e\u5927\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u8fb9\u7f18\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd\u74f6\u9888\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5f80\u5f80\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLIME\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u9519\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5e76\u884c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5378\u8f7d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u79bb\u7ebf\u5206\u914d\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5185\u5b58\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784Nvidia Jetson\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72LLaMA3.3-70B-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u661f\u548c\u7a81\u53d1\u8bf7\u6c42\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.7\u500d\u548c3.7\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "LIME\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u635f\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

However, existing analyses are typically problem-specific and focus on first-order consequences such as conservation laws, while the implications for second-order structure remain less understood. We develop a general equivariance toolbox that yields coupled first- and second-order constraints on learning dynamics. The framework extends classical Noether-type analyses in three directions: from gradient constraints to Hessian constraints, from symmetry to general equivariance, and from continuous to discrete transformations. At the first order, our framework unifies conservation laws and implicit-bias relations as special cases of a single identity. At the second order, it provides structural predictions about curvature: which directions are flat or sharp, how the gradient aligns with Hessian eigenspaces, and how the loss landscape geometry reflects the underlying transformation structure. We illustrate the framework through several applications, recovering known results while also deriving new characterizations that connect transformation structure to modern empirical observations about optimization geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7b49\u53d8\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178Noether\u5206\u6790\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e8c\u9636\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u53d8\u6362\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u901a\u5e38\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7b49\u4e00\u9636\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8c\u9636\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7b49\u53d8\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178Noether\u5206\u6790\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\uff1a\u4ece\u68af\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u5230Hessian\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ece\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5230\u4e00\u822c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u6362\u5230\u79bb\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u9636\u5c42\u9762\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u7f6e\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5728\u4e8c\u9636\u5c42\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5e73\u5766/\u9661\u5ced\u65b9\u5411\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0eHessian\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\u5982\u4f55\u53cd\u6620\u5e95\u5c42\u53d8\u6362\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u63a5\u53d8\u6362\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u8fde\u63a5\u53d8\u6362\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u65b0\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

Rather than conducting separate phases for generating a large corpus and subsequently minimizing it, we propose FuzzWise which integrates them into one process to generate the optimal initial corpus of seeds (ICS). FuzzWise leverages a multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). The first LLM agent generates test cases for the target program. The second LLM agent, which functions as a predictive code coverage module, assesses whether each generated test case will enhance the overall coverage of the current corpus. The streamlined process allows each newly generated test seed to be immediately evaluated for its contribution to the overall coverage. FuzzWise employs a predictive approach using an LLM and eliminates the need for actual execution, saving computational resources and time, particularly in scenarios where the execution is not desirable or even impossible. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that FuzzWise generates significantly fewer test cases than baseline methods. Despite the lower number of test cases, FuzzWise achieves high code coverage and triggers more runtime errors compared to the baselines. Moreover, it is more time-efficient and coverage-efficient in producing an initial corpus catching more errors.", "AI": {"tldr": "FuzzWise\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u521d\u59cb\u79cd\u5b50\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u7070\u76d2\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u79cd\u5b50\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u679c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5148\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u518d\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u6d6a\u8d39\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002FuzzWise\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u521d\u59cb\u79cd\u5b50\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u3002", "method": "FuzzWise\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6d41\u7ebf\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u5141\u8bb8\u7acb\u5373\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u79cd\u5b50\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b9e\u9645\u6267\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cFuzzWise\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u5c11\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46FuzzWise\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u89e6\u53d1\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u6355\u83b7\u66f4\u591a\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u9762\uff0cFuzzWise\u66f4\u52a0\u65f6\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "FuzzWise\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u79cd\u5b50\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u6216\u4e0d\u5e0c\u671b\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Parameterization approaches are used to extract a single method from multiple code clones that contain differences. This approach parameterizes expressions and behaviors within a method. In particular, behavior parameterization has been extensively studied in Java programs, but little research has been conducted on other programming languages.\n  Lambda expressions can be used to parameterize behaviors, but the specifications of each programming language significantly affect the applicability of this technique. Therefore, the optimal \"Extract Method\" approach may vary depending on the programming language.\n  In this study, we propose a C#-specific technique that uses lambda expressions to analyze and consolidate code clones.

Estimating excess mortality, defined as deaths beyond expected levels based on pre-pandemic patterns, is essential for understanding pandemic impacts and informing intervention strategies. However, traditional statistical methods like SARIMA assume linearity, stationarity, and fixed seasonality, which may not hold under structural disruptions. We present a systematic comparison of SARIMA against three deep learning (DL) architectures (LSTM, Seq2Seq, and Transformer) for counterfactual mortality estimation using national CDC data (2015-2019 for training/validation, 2020-2023 for projection). We contribute empirical evidence that LSTM achieves superior point estimation (17.08% MAPE vs. 23.88% for SARIMA) and better-calibrated uncertainty (68.8% vs. 47.9% prediction interval coverage) when projecting under regime change. We also demonstrate that attention-based models (Seq2Seq, Transformer) underperform due to overfitting to historical means rather than capturing emergent trends. Ourreproducible pipeline incorporates conformal prediction intervals and convergence analysis across 60+ trials per configuration, and we provide an open-source framework deployable with 15 state health departments.

We propose XTrace, a novel dynamic tracing framework. XTrace introduces a new paradigm of non-invasive proxying, which avoids direct modification of the virtual machine's underlying data structures. It achieves high-performance method interception by leveraging and optimizing the highly stable, built-in instrumentation mechanism of the Android ART virtual machine. Evaluated in a ByteDance application with hundreds of millions of daily active users, XTrace demonstrated production-grade stability and performance. Large-scale online A/B experiments confirmed its stability, showing no statistically significant impact (p > 0.05) on Crash User Rate or ANR rate, while maintaining minimal overhead (<7 ms startup latency, <0.01 ms per-method call) and broad compatibility (Android 5.0-15+).

Quek", "Tsung-Hui Chang"], "title": "Robust Federated Fine-Tuning in Heterogeneous Networks with Unreliable Connections: An Aggregation View", "categories": ["cs.DC"], "comment": null, "summary": "Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT) has attracted growing interest as it leverages both server- and client-side data to enhance global model generalization while preserving privacy, and significantly reduces the computational burden on edge devices by avoiding training from scratch. Despite these advantages, FFT performance is often degraded by unreliable server-client connections and heterogeneous client data distributions. Most existing methods assume homogeneous network conditions or require prior knowledge of connection failures. However, these assumptions are impractical in real-world networks characterized by diverse communication standards (e.g., wired, Wi-Fi, 4G, and 5G) and heterogeneous failure patterns. To address these limitations, we propose FedAuto, a novel FFT framework that mitigates the combined effects of connection failures and data heterogeneity via adaptive aggregation. FedAuto operates without prior knowledge of network conditions or modifications to existing infrastructure, enabling seamless plug-and-play deployment.

By adopting a novel per-round aggregation perspective, our analysis removes the need for assumptions on connection failures probabilities or client selection strategies commonly imposed in prior work, and guarantees convergence of FedAuto for each individual realization, providing a stronger theoretical assurance.

A limitation of existing approaches is the assumption that the tensor rank-a critical parameter governing model complexity-is known. However, determining the optimal rank is a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) task and there is a limited understanding regarding the expressive power of functional low-rank tensor models for continuous signals. We propose a rank-revealing functional Bayesian tensor completion (RR-FBTC) method. Modeling the latent functions through carefully designed multioutput Gaussian processes, RR-FBTC handles tensors with real-valued indices while enabling automatic tensor rank determination during the inference process. We establish the universal approximation property of the model for continuous multi-dimensional signals, demonstrating its expressive power in a concise format. To learn this model, we employ the variational inference framework and derive an efficient algorithm with closed-form updates.

Existing type inference tools have achieved advances in type inference within isolated code snippets.

To fill this gap, we present \\methodName, a novel approach based on LLMs that achieves repository-level type inference through the co-evolution of types and dependencies. \\methodName~constructs an Entity Dependency Graph (EDG) to model the objects and type dependencies across the repository. During the inference process, it iteratively refines types and dependencies in EDG for accurate type inference. Our key innovations are: (1) an EDG model designed to capture repository-level type dependencies; (2) an iterative type inference approach where types and dependencies co-evolve in each iteration; and (3) a type-checker-in-the-loop strategy that validates and corrects inferences on-the-fly, thereby reducing error propagation.

We present FUSCO, an MoE-friendly communication library that achieves efficient and lightweight data shuffling through fused data transformation and communication, based on the key observation that MoE's expert-major data layout conflicts with the device-major layout expected by communication operations. FUSCO captures the fine-grained data layout, which is then interpreted by a pipelined communication engine that performs the required shuffling efficiently along the communication path.

In this work, we introduce MotionTeller, a generative framework that natively integrates minute-level wearable activity data with large language models (LLMs). MotionTeller combines a pretrained actigraphy encoder with a lightweight projection module that maps behavioral embeddings into the token space of a frozen decoder-only LLM, enabling free-text, autoregressive generation of daily behavioral summaries. We construct a novel dataset of 54383 (actigraphy, text) pairs derived from real-world NHANES recordings, and train the model using cross-entropy loss with supervision only on the language tokens. MotionTeller achieves high semantic fidelity (BERTScore-F1 = 0.924) and lexical accuracy (ROUGE-1 = 0.722), outperforming prompt-based baselines by 7 percent in ROUGE-1. The average training loss converges to 0.38 by epoch 15, indicating stable optimization. Qualitative analysis confirms that MotionTeller captures circadian structure and behavioral transitions, while PCA plots reveal enhanced cluster alignment in embedding space post-training.

Prior research identifies code- and configuration-related issues as the predominant category of root causes in cloud incidents. This paper introduces PRAXIS, an orchestrator that manages and deploys an agentic workflow for diagnosing code- and configuration-caused cloud incidents. PRAXIS employs an LLM-driven structured traversal over two types of graph: (1) a service dependency graph (SDG) that captures microservice-level dependencies; and (2) a hammock-block program dependence graph (PDG) that captures code-level dependencies for each microservice. Together, these graphs encode microservice- and code-level dependencies and the LLM acts as a traversal policy over these graphs, moving between services and code dependencies to localize and explain failures. Compared to state-of-the-art ReAct baselines, PRAXIS improves RCA accuracy by up to 3.1x while reducing token consumption by 3.8x.

Although existing IMVC methods have made progress from both imputation-based and imputation-free routes, they have overlooked the pair under-utilization issue, i.e., inconsistent missing patterns make the incomplete but available multi-view pairs unable to be fully utilized, thereby limiting the model performance. To address this, we propose a novel missing-pattern tree based IMVC framework entitled TreeEIC. Specifically, to achieve full exploitation of available multi-view pairs, TreeEIC first defines the missing-pattern tree model to group data into multiple decision sets according to different missing patterns, and then performs multi-view clustering within each set. Furthermore, a multi-view decision ensemble module is proposed to aggregate clustering results from all decision sets, which infers uncertainty-based weights to suppress unreliable clustering decisions and produce robust decisions. Finally, an ensemble-to-individual knowledge distillation module transfers the ensemble knowledge to view-specific clustering models, which enables ensemble and individual modules to promote each other by optimizing cross-view consistency and inter-cluster discrimination losses. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our TreeEIC achieves state-of-the-art IMVC performance and exhibits superior robustness under highly inconsistent missing patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "TreeEIC\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u6811\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7ec4\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u53ef\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\"\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\"\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f7f\u5f97\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u4f46\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "1) \u5b9a\u4e49\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u6811\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u5206\u7ec4\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u4e2d\uff1b2) \u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u5185\u6267\u884c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u6240\u6709\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b4) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u96c6\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTreeEIC\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TreeEIC\u901a\u8fc7\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u6811\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u53ef\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u7684\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the marginal gains from simply increasing data for CPT diminish rapidly, yielding suboptimal data utilization and inefficient training. To address this challenge, we propose a novel perplexity-aware data scaling law to establish a predictive relationship between the perplexity landscape of domain-specific data and the test loss. Our approach leverages the perplexity derived from the pre-trained model on domain data as a proxy for estimating the knowledge gap, effectively quantifying the informational perplexity landscape of candidate training samples. By fitting this scaling law across diverse perplexity regimes, we enable adaptive selection of high-utility data subsets, prioritizing content that maximizes knowledge absorption while minimizing redundancy and noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently identifies near-optimal training subsets and achieves superior performance on both medical and general-domain benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5355\u7eaf\u589e\u52a0\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u9ad8", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u8bc6\u522b\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u7597\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387"}}

To select the most compatible parser for a specific system, multiple evaluation metrics are commonly used for performance comparisons. However, existing evaluation metrics heavily rely on labeled log data, which limits prior studies to a fixed set of datasets and hinders parser evaluations and selections in the industry. Further, we discovered that different versions of ground-truth used in existing studies can lead to inconsistent performance conclusions. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel label-free template-level metric, PMSS (parser medoid silhouette score), to evaluate log parser performance. PMSS evaluates both parser grouping and template quality with medoid silhouette analysis and Levenshtein distance within a near-linear time complexity in general. To understand its relationship with label-based template-level metrics, FGA and FTA, we compared their evaluation outcomes for six log parsers on the standard corrected Loghub 2.0 dataset. Our results indicate that log parsers achieving the highest PMSS or FGA exhibit comparable performance, differing by only 2.1% on average in terms of the FGA score; the difference is 9.8% for FTA. PMSS is also significantly (p<1e-8) and positively correlated to both FGA and FTA: the Spearman's rho correlation coefficient of PMSS-FGA and PMSS-FTA are respectively 0.648 and 0.587, close to the coefficient between FGA and FTA (0.670). We further extended our discussion on how to interpret the conclusions from different metrics, identifying challenges in using PMSS, and provided guidelines on conducting parser selections with our metric.

These resources, whether local or global, are protected within critical sections to prevent race conditions, with locking protocols ensuring both exclusive access and timing requirements. However, transient faults occurring within critical sections can disrupt execution and propagate errors across multiple tasks. Conventional locking protocols fail to address such faults, and integrating traditional fault tolerance techniques often increases blocking. Recent approaches improve fault recovery through parallel replica execution; however, challenges remain due to sequential accessing, coordination overhead, and susceptibility to common-mode faults. In this paper, we propose a Lock-frEe Fault-Tolerant Resource Sharing (LEFT-RS) protocol for multicore real-time systems. LEFT-RS allows tasks to concurrently access and read global resources while entering their critical sections in parallel. Each task can complete its access earlier upon successful execution if other tasks experience faults, thereby improving the efficiency of resource usage. Our design also limits the overhead and enhances fault resilience. We present a comprehensive worst-case response time analysis to ensure timing guarantees.

That is, rare-paired issue prevents MVC from extracting sufficient multi-view complementary information, and mis-paired issue causes contrastive learning to optimize the model in the wrong direction. To address these issues, we propose a unified CL-based MVC framework for enhancing clustering effectiveness on incomplete and noise multi-view data. First, to overcome the rare-paired issue, we design a global-graph guided contrastive learning, where all view samples construct a global-view affinity graph to form new sample pairs for fully exploring complementary information.

Powered by goal-driven autonomy, they represent a powerful form of generative AI, marking a transition from reactive content generation into proactive multitasking capabilities. As an exemplar, we propose an architecture of a multi-agent system for the implementation phase of the software engineering process. We also present a comprehensive threat model for the proposed system. We demonstrate that while such systems can generate code quite accurately, they are vulnerable to attacks, including code injection. Due to their autonomous design and lack of humans in the loop, these systems cannot identify and respond to attacks by themselves. This paper analyzes the vulnerability of multi-agent systems and concludes that the coder-reviewer-tester architecture is more resilient than both the coder and coder-tester architectures, but is less efficient at writing code. We find that by adding a security analysis agent, we mitigate the loss in efficiency while achieving even better resiliency. We conclude by demonstrating that the security analysis agent is vulnerable to advanced code injection attacks, showing that embedding poisonous few-shot examples in the injected code can increase the attack success rate from 0% to 71.95%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u53d7\u4ee3\u7801\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0coder-reviewer-tester\u67b6\u6784\u6bd4coder\u548ccoder-tester\u67b6\u6784\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u4f46\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7406\u672c\u8eab\u4ecd\u6613\u53d7\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5373\u5c06\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4ea7\u4e1a\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u8f6c\u5411\u4e3b\u52a8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u884c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u65bd\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83coder\u3001coder-tester\u548ccoder-reviewer-tester\u4e09\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7406\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "result": "coder-reviewer-tester\u67b6\u6784\u6bd4coder\u548ccoder-tester\u67b6\u6784\u66f4\u5177\u5f39\u6027\u4f46\u7f16\u7801\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u6dfb\u52a0\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u635f\u5931\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5f39\u6027\uff1b\u7136\u800c\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7406\u672c\u8eab\u6613\u53d7\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6ce8\u5165\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u6709\u6bd2\u7684few-shot\u793a\u4f8b\u53ef\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece0%\u63d0\u5347\u523071.95%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4ee3\u7801\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7406\u672c\u8eab\u4ecd\u9700\u9632\u62a4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

We introduce Fed-$\u03b1$-NormEC, the first differentially private FL framework providing provable convergence and DP guarantees under standard assumptions while fully supporting these practical features. Fed-$\u03b1$-NormE integrates local updates (full and incremental gradient steps), separate server and client stepsizes, and, crucially, partial client participation, which is essential for real-world deployment and vital for privacy amplification.

There are many practical achievements in binary code analysis, but fine-grained analysis such as dynamic taint analysis, is constantly studied due to the problem of deployability, high memory usage, and performance overhead, so as to better adapt to the new analysis scenario, such as memory corruption exploits and sandbox evasion malware. This paper presents a new binary program analysis framework, in order to improve the usability and performance of fine-grained analysis. The framework mainly uses the kernel module to further expand the analysis capability of the traditional dynamic binary instrumentation. Then, based on the idea of decoupling analysis, the analysis environment is constructed in the container process through process hollowing techniques in a new way. It can reuse the functions of the existing dynamic binary instrumentation platforms and also reduce the impact on the execution of the target program. The prototype is implemented on the Windows platform. The validity and performance of the framework are verified by a large number of experiments with benchmark and actual programs.

To operationalize GAC, we introduce a specific instantiation based on a latent variable model that features continuous latent plan vectors. We develop novel inference strategies for both \\textit{exploitation}, by optimizing latent plans to maximize expected returns, and \\textit{exploration}, by sampling latent plans conditioned on dynamically adjusted target returns.

However, current computational methods struggle to capture intricate sequence dependencies and effectively handle ambiguous, hard-to-classify samples. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Fusion, a novel two-stage deep learning framework integrating adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. Unlike traditional static feature concatenation, we construct a panoramic feature space using 10 distinct descriptors and introduce an Adaptive Gating Mechanism.This mechanism dynamically regulates the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Furthermore, to address data distribution challenges, we employ a contrastive learning strategy driven by Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) and BLOSUM62-based data augmentation, which significantly sharpens the model's decision boundaries. Experimental results on the benchmark Set 1 dataset demonstrate that AVP-Fusion achieves an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

To address this, we introduce Reflection-Driven Control, a standardized and pluggable control module that can be seamlessly integrated into general agent architectures. Reflection-Driven Control elevates \"self-reflection\" from a post hoc patch into an explicit step in the agent's own reasoning process: during generation, the agent continuously runs an internal reflection loop that monitors and evaluates its own decision path. When potential risks are detected, the system retrieves relevant repair examples and secure coding guidelines from an evolving reflective memory, injecting these evidence-based constraints directly into subsequent reasoning steps. We instantiate Reflection-Driven Control in the setting of secure code generation and systematically evaluate it across eight classes of security-critical programming tasks. Empirical results show that Reflection-Driven Control substantially improves the security and policy compliance of generated code while largely preserving functional correctness, with minimal runtime and token overhead.

This paper conducts the first systematic exploration of a critical and stealthy threat: backdoor attacks targeting the retriever component, which represents a significant supply-chain vulnerability. It is infeasible to assess this threat realistically, as existing attack methods are either too ineffective to pose a real danger or are easily detected by state-of-the-art defense mechanisms spanning both latent-space analysis and token-level inspection, which achieve consistently high detection rates. To overcome this barrier and enable a realistic analysis, we first developed VenomRACG, a new class of potent and stealthy attack that serves as a vehicle for our investigation. Its design makes poisoned samples statistically indistinguishable from benign code, allowing the attack to consistently maintain low detectability across all evaluated defense mechanisms. Armed with this capability, our exploration reveals a severe vulnerability: by injecting vulnerable code equivalent to only 0.05% of the entire knowledge base size, an attacker can successfully manipulate the backdoored retriever to rank the vulnerable code in its top-5 results in 51.29% of cases. This translates to severe downstream harm, causing models like GPT-4o to generate vulnerable code in over 40% of targeted scenarios, while leaving the system's general performance intact. Our findings establish that retriever backdooring is not a theoretical concern but a practical threat to the software development ecosystem that current defenses are blind to, highlighting the urgent need for robust security measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86RACG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684VenomRACG\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ec5\u9700\u6ce8\u51650.05%\u7684\u6076\u610f\u4ee3\u7801\u5373\u53ef\u572851.29%\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f7f\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u5c06\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\u6392\u5728\u524d5\u4f4d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4GPT-4o\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u572840%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210(RACG)\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u6548\u679c\u592a\u5dee\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u4e14\u9690\u853d\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86VenomRACG\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6837\u672c\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4e0e\u826f\u6027\u4ee3\u7801\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u9700\u6ce8\u5165\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u603b\u91cf0.05%\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5c31\u80fd\u572851.29%\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f7f\u540e\u95e8\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u5c06\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\u6392\u5728\u524d5\u4f4d\u3002\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4GPT-4o\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d85\u8fc740%\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u800c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u4e0d\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u5f3a\u5927\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\u3002"}}

Although recent approaches model spatial and temporal correlations, they often under-exploit two practical characteristics of real deployments: the sparse spatial distribution of locations and the heterogeneous availability of auxiliary features across locations. To address these challenges, we propose AnchorGK, an Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning framework for inductive spatio-temporal kriging. AnchorGK introduces anchor locations to stratify the data in a principled manner. Anchors are constructed according to feature availability, and strata are then formed around these anchors. This stratification serves two complementary roles. First, it explicitly represents and continuously updates correlations between unobserved regions and surrounding observed locations within a graph learning framework. Second, it enables the systematic use of all available features across strata via an incremental representation mechanism, mitigating feature incompleteness without discarding informative signals. Building on the stratified structure, we design a dual-view graph learning layer that jointly aggregates feature-relevant and location-relevant information, learning stratum-specific representations that support accurate inference under inductive settings.

However, it poses a big challenge to replicate this learning process for autonomous agents, due to the complexity of visual input, the absence of action or reward signals, and the limitations of interaction steps. In this paper, we propose a novel, unsupervised, and sample-efficient framework to achieve imitation learning from videos (ILV), named Behavior Cloning from Videos via Latent Representations (BCV-LR). BCV-LR extracts action-related latent features from high-dimensional video inputs through self-supervised tasks, and then leverages a dynamics-based unsupervised objective to predict latent actions between consecutive frames. The pre-trained latent actions are fine-tuned and efficiently aligned to the real action space online (with collected interactions) for policy behavior cloning. The cloned policy in turn enriches the agent experience for further latent action finetuning, resulting in an iterative policy improvement that is highly sample-efficient.\n  We conduct extensive experiments on a set of challenging visual tasks, including both discrete control and continuous control. BCV-LR enables effective (even expert-level on some tasks) policy performance with only a few interactions, surpassing state-of-the-art ILV baselines and reinforcement learning methods (provided with environmental rewards) in terms of sample efficiency across 24/28 tasks.

Such skewness undermines model reliability, particularly for rare but clinically crucial outcomes, making robustness and scalability essential for real-world usage. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the robustness and scalability of classical machine learning models on imbalanced tabular data from MIMIC-IV-ED and eICU. Class imbalance was quantified using complementary metrics, and we compared the performance of tree-based methods, the state-of-the-art TabNet deep learning model, and a custom lightweight residual network. TabResNet was designed as a computationally efficient alternative to TabNet, replacing its complex attention mechanisms with a streamlined residual architecture to maintain representational capacity for real-time clinical use. All models were optimized via a Bayesian hyperparameter search and assessed on predictive performance, robustness to increasing imbalance, and computational scalability. Our results, on seven clinically vital predictive tasks, show that tree-based methods, particularly XGBoost, consistently achieved the most stable performance across imbalance levels and scaled efficiently with sample size. Deep tabular models degraded more sharply under imbalance and incurred higher computational costs, while TabResNet provided a lighter alternative to TabNet but did not surpass ensemble benchmarks. These findings indicate that in emergency and critical care, robustness to imbalance and computational scalability could outweigh architectural complexity.

Traditional neural network-based solvers, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Deep Galerkin Methods, often face challenges in generalization and long-time prediction efficiency due to their dependence on full space-time approximations. To address these issues, we propose a novel and scalable framework that significantly enhances the Neural Galerkin Method (NGM) by incorporating the Meta-Auto-Decoder (MAD) paradigm. Our approach leverages space-time decoupling to enable more stable and efficient time integration, while meta-learning-driven adaptation allows rapid generalization to unseen parameter configurations with minimal retraining.

Three model families were investigated: Extra Trees with XGBoost (ET-XGB), Random Forest with LightGBM (RF-LGBM), and Transformer with XGBoost (Transformer-XGB). The target properties included compressive strength (CS), flexural strength (FS), and tensile strength (TS), based on an extensive dataset compiled from published experimental studies. Model training involved k-fold cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), and uncertainty analysis to ensure both robustness and interpretability. Among the tested approaches, the ET-XGB model achieved the highest overall accuracy, with testing R^2 values of 0.994 for CS, 0.944 for FS, and 0.978 for TS and exhibited lowest uncertainty for CS and TS (approximately 13-16% and 30.4%, respectively). The RF-LGBM model provided the most stable and reliable predictions for FS (R^2 0.977), yielding the lowest uncertainty for FS (approximately 5-33%). The Transformer-XGB model demonstrated strong predictive capability (R^2 0.978 for TS and 0.967 for FS) but consistently showed the highest uncertainty, indicating reduced generalization reliability. SHAP analysis further indicated that fiber aspect ratios (AR1 and AR2), silica fume (Sfu), and steel fiber content (SF) were the most influential predictors of strength, whereas water content (W) and the water-binder ratio (w/b) consistently had negative effects. The findings confirm that machine learning models can provide accurate, interpretable, and generalizable predictions of HPC mechanical properties.

Central to MCTS is the search strategy, governed by a tree policy based on an upper confidence bound (UCB) applied to trees (UCT). A key factor in the success of AlphaZero is the introduction of a prior term in the UCB1-based tree policy PUCT, which improves exploration efficiency and thus accelerates training. While many alternative UCBs with stronger theoretical guarantees than UCB1 exist, extending them to prior-based UCTs has been challenging, since PUCT was derived empirically rather than from first principles. Recent work retrospectively justified PUCT by framing MCTS as a regularized policy optimization (RPO) problem. Building on this perspective, we introduce Inverse-RPO, a general methodology that systematically derives prior-based UCTs from any prior-free UCB. Applying this method to the variance-aware UCB-V, we obtain two new prior-based tree policies that incorporate variance estimates into the search. Experiments indicate that these variance-aware prior-based UCTs outperform PUCT across multiple benchmarks without incurring additional computational cost. We also provide an extension of the mctx library supporting variance-aware UCTs, showing that the required code changes are minimal and intended to facilitate further research on principled prior-based UCTs.

However, existing methods often suffer from causal blindness, treating process modalities (e.g., real-time video, audio, and sensors) and result modalities (e.g., post-weld images) as equal feature sources, thereby ignoring the inherent physical generative logic. Furthermore, the heterogeneity gap between high-dimensional visual data and low-dimensional sensor signals frequently leads to critical process context being drowned out. In this paper, we propose Causal-HM, a unified multimodal UAD framework that explicitly models the physical Process to Result dependency. Specifically, our framework incorporates two key innovations: a Sensor-Guided CHM Modulation mechanism that utilizes low-dimensional sensor signals as context to guide high-dimensional audio-visual feature extraction , and a Causal-Hierarchical Architecture that enforces a unidirectional generative mapping to identify anomalies that violate physical consistency.

To reduce their computational and memory burden, various compression techniques have been proposed, including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. Among these, post-training quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted for its efficiency, as it requires no retraining and only a small dataset for calibration, enabling low-cost deployment. Recent advances for post-training quantization have demonstrated that even sub-4-bit methods can maintain most of the original model performance. However, 1-bit quantization that converts floating-point weights to \\(\\pm\\)1, remains particularly challenging, as existing 1-bit PTQ methods often suffer from significant performance degradation compared to the full-precision models. Specifically, most of existing 1-bit PTQ approaches focus on weight alignment, aligning the full-precision model weights with those of the quantized models, rather than directly aligning their outputs. Although the output-matching approach objective is more intuitive and aligns with the quantization goal, naively applying it in 1-bit LLMs often leads to notable performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate why and under what conditions output-matching fails, in the context of 1-bit LLM quantization. Based on our findings, we propose a novel data-aware PTQ approach for 1-bit LLMs that explicitly accounts for activation error accumulation while keeping optimization efficient.

In this work, we introduce \\emph{Dictionary-Transform Generative Adversarial Networks} (DT-GAN), a fully model-based adversarial framework in which the generator is a sparse synthesis dictionary and the discriminator is an analysis transform acting as an energy model. By restricting both players to linear operators with explicit constraints, DT-GAN departs fundamentally from neural GAN architectures and admits rigorous theoretical analysis.\n  We show that the DT-GAN adversarial game is well posed and admits at least one Nash equilibrium. Under a sparse generative model, equilibrium solutions are provably identifiable up to standard permutation and sign ambiguities and exhibit a precise geometric alignment between synthesis and analysis operators. We further establish finite-sample stability and consistency of empirical equilibria, demonstrating that DT-GAN training converges reliably under standard sampling assumptions and remains robust in heavy-tailed regimes.\n  Experiments on mixture-structured synthetic data validate the theoretical predictions, showing that DT-GAN consistently recovers underlying structure and exhibits stable behavior under identical optimization budgets where a standard GAN degrades.

In such applications, uncertainty estimation in forecasting is important because it helps evaluate traffic risk levels, assess forecast reliability, and provide timely warnings. As a result, probabilistic traffic flow forecasting (PTFF) has gained significant attention, as it produces both point forecasts and uncertainty estimates. However, existing PTFF approaches still face two key challenges: (1) how to uncover and model the causes of traffic flow uncertainty for reliable forecasting, and (2) how to capture the spatiotemporal correlations of uncertainty for accurate prediction.\n  To address these challenges, we propose RIPCN, a Road Impedance Principal Component Network that integrates domain-specific transportation theory with spatiotemporal principal component learning for PTFF. RIPCN introduces a dynamic impedance evolution network that captures directional traffic transfer patterns driven by road congestion level and flow variability, revealing the direct causes of uncertainty and enhancing both reliability and interpretability.

Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller \"compressor\" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger \"predictor\" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is $1.6\\times$ more accurate, $4.6\\times$ more concise, and conveys $5.5\\times$ more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors. Applied to a Deep Research system, these principles enable local compressors as small as 3B parameters to recover $99\\%$ of frontier-LM accuracy at $26\\%$ of API costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u5668-\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u5927\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u89c4\u6a21\u6bd4\u6269\u5927\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ee3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\"\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\"\u548c\"Claude Code\"\uff09\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u538b\u7f29\u5668-\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u914d\u5bf9\u626b\u63cf\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u538b\u7f29\u5668LM\u89c6\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u5176\u538b\u7f29\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u4e0d\u4ec5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u66f4token\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u4f20\u9012\u66f4\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c7B Qwen-2.5\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u6bd41.5B\u7248\u672c\u51c6\u786e1.6\u500d\uff0c\u7b80\u6d014.6\u500d\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u4f20\u90125.5\u500d\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6269\u5927\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u89c4\u6a21\u6bd4\u6269\u5927\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c0f\u578b\u672c\u5730\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff08\u59823B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u524d\u6cbfLM 99%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e26%\u7684API\u6210\u672c\u3002\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u662f\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

Existing approaches typically treat all layers uniformly, often trading stability for plasticity or vice versa. However, different layers naturally exhibit varying levels of uncertainty (entropy) when classifying tasks. High-entropy layers tend to underfit by failing to capture task-specific patterns, while low-entropy layers risk overfitting by becoming overly confident and specialized. To address this imbalance, we propose an entropy-aware continual learning method that employs a dynamic feedback mechanism to regulate each layer based on its entropy. Specifically, our approach reduces entropy in high-entropy layers to mitigate underfitting and increases entropy in overly confident layers to alleviate overfitting. This adaptive regulation encourages the model to converge to wider local minima, which have been shown to improve generalization. Our method is general and can be seamlessly integrated with both replay- and regularization-based approaches.

Neural network (NN) models, along with gradient boosting machines, are expected to be utilized even in tabular data with high prediction accuracy.

We propose a causal explanation method, CENNET, and a new explanation power index using entropy for the method. CENNET provides causal explanations for predictions by NNs and uses structural causal models (SCMs) effectively combined with the NNs although SCMs are usually not used as predictive models on their own in terms of predictive accuracy. We show that CEN-NET provides such explanations through comparative experiments with existing methods on both synthetic and quasi-real data in classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCENNET\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u71b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u6307\u6807", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u539f\u56e0\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u9762\u4e0d\u8db3", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCENNET\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b(SCMs)\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u71b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u51c6\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cCENNET\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u91ca", "conclusion": "CENNET\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u91ca"}}

We present a novel Interpretable Variant-Aware Multi-Path Network (VAMP-Net) that addresses both challenges through complementary machine learning pathways. Path-1 employs a Set Attention Transformer processing permutation-invariant variant sets to capture epistatic interactions between genomic loci. Path-2 utilizes a 1D Convolutional Neural Network that analyzes Variant Call Format quality metrics to learn adaptive confidence scores. A fusion module combines both pathways for final resistance classification. We conduct comparative evaluations of unmasked versus padding-masked Set Attention Blocks, and demonstrate that our multi-path architecture achieves superior performance over baseline CNN and MLP models, with accuracy exceeding 95% and AUC around 97% for Rifampicin (RIF) and Rifabutin (RFB) resistance prediction. The framework provides dual-layer interpretability: Attention Weight Analysis reveals Epistatic networks, and Integrated Gradients (IG) was applied for critical resistance loci (notably rpoB), while gradient-based feature importance from the CNN pathway uncovers drug-specific dependencies on data quality metrics.

This paper presents a unified multi-criteria evaluation framework for synthetic financial data and applies it to three representative generative paradigms: the statistical ARIMA-GARCH baseline, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGAN). Using historical S and P 500 daily data, we evaluate fidelity (Maximum Mean Discrepancy, MMD), temporal structure (autocorrelation and volatility clustering), and practical utility in downstream tasks, specifically mean-variance portfolio optimization and volatility forecasting. Empirical results indicate that ARIMA-GARCH captures linear trends and conditional volatility but fails to reproduce nonlinear dynamics; VAEs produce smooth trajectories that underestimate extreme events; and TimeGAN achieves the best trade-off between realism and temporal coherence (e.g., TimeGAN attained the lowest MMD: 1.84e-3, average over 5 seeds).

The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \\texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \\texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \\texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Through our analysis, we observe that, in on-policy settings: (1) estimator configurations with biased gradients can result in training instabilities; and (2) using estimator configurations resulting in unbiased gradients leads to better performance on in-domain as well as out-of-domain tasks. We also investigate the performance resulting from different KL configurations in off-policy settings and observe that KL regularization can help stabilize off-policy RL training resulting from asynchronous setups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86LLM\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2dKL\u6563\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u57df\u5185\u548c\u57df\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1KL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5728LLM\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2dKL\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540cKL\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528Qwen2.5-7B\u3001Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\u548cQwen3-4B-Instruct-2507\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884cRL\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u57df\u5185\u548c\u57df\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff1a(1) \u6709\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b(2) \u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u57df\u5185\u548c\u57df\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cKL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f02\u6b65\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "KL\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9LLM\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u90fd\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

A trained random forest is converted into transparent, axis-aligned rule regions (leaf hyperrectangles), and synthetic transactions are generated by uniformly sampling within each region. This produces a compact, auditable surrogate dataset that preserves local feature interactions without exposing sensitive original records. The rule regions also support explainability: aggregated rule statistics (for example, support and lift) describe global patterns, while assigning each case to its generating region gives concise human-readable rationales and calibrated uncertainty based on tree-vote disagreement.\n  On the IEEE-CIS fraud dataset (590k transactions across three institution-like clusters), distilled datasets reduce data volume by 85% to 93% (often under 15% of the original) while maintaining competitive precision and micro-F1, with only a modest AUC drop. Sharing and augmenting with synthesized data across institutions improves cross-cluster precision, recall, and AUC. Real vs. synthesized structure remains highly similar (over 93% by nearest-neighbor cosine analysis). Membership-inference attacks perform at chance level (about 0.50) when distinguishing training from hold-out records, suggesting low memorization risk. Removing high-uncertainty synthetic points using disagreement scores further boosts AUC (up to 0.687) and improves calibration. Sensitivity tests show weak dependence on the distillation ratio (AUC about 0.641 to 0.645 from 6% to 60%).\n  Overall, tree-region distillation enables trustworthy, deployable fraud analytics with interpretable global rules, per-case rationales with quantified uncertainty, and strong privacy properties suitable for multi-institution settings and regulatory audit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u89c4\u5219\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f2985-93%\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u673a\u6784\u534f\u4f5c\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u91d1\u878d\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u673a\u6784\u534f\u4f5c\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u66b4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c4\u5219\u533a\u57df\uff08\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\u8d85\u77e9\u5f62\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u5185\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5219\u7edf\u8ba1\uff08\u652f\u6301\u5ea6\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u5ea6\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u914d\u751f\u6210\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u6295\u7968\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEEE-CIS\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u91cf85-93%\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548cmicro-F1\uff0cAUC\u4ec5\u6709\u9002\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8de8\u673a\u6784\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u53c9\u96c6\u7fa4\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8d8593%\uff0c\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\uff08\u7ea60.50\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4f4e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u6b67\u5206\u6570\u79fb\u9664\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5408\u6210\u70b9\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347AUC\u81f30.687\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6811\u533a\u57df\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6b3a\u8bc8\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u5e26\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7ea7\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9002\u5408\u591a\u673a\u6784\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

This design explicitly supports specialization across therapeutic and design subspaces while maintaining scalable computation through top-k routing. MMCTOP achieves consistent improvements in precision, F1, and AUC over unimodal and multimodal baselines on benchmark datasets, and ablations show that schema-guided textualization and selective expert routing contribute materially to performance and stability.

However, these schemes generally add to underlying language model complexity and force large changes to architecture, making them hard to implement at large scales. To overcome these challenges, we propose the gated quantized variational autoencoder (GQ-VAE), a novel architecture that can be independently pre-trained to serve as a drop-in replacement for existing tokenizers. The key innovation of the architecture is to learn to encode variable-length discrete tokens. GQ-VAE improves compression and language modeling performance over a standard VQ-VAE tokenizer, and approaches the compression rate and language modeling performance of BPE. Interestingly, if we use BPE with a smaller vocabulary, such that the compression is equivalent between GQ-VAE and BPE, we find that GQ-VAE improves downstream language model learning.

Existing solutions leverage generative models to learn original data distributions. However, real-world data are naturally heterogeneous with diverse distributions, making it challenging to obtain a universally good model for diverse data generation. To address this limitation, we introduce Diversity-Aware Tabular data gEnerator (DATE), a framework that (i) prepares high-quality and distributionally distinct examples for in-context learning by effectively partitioning the original heterogeneous data into multiple diverse subsets; (ii) harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the diversity of the partitioned distribution with decision tree reasoning as feedback, generating high-quality labeled data for each subset. However, the massive generated data inherently involves a trade-off between diversity and quality. To integrate this issue, existing solutions greedily select the validation-best data. However, we prove that the selection in heterogeneous settings does not possess the greedy-choice property, and design a Multi-Arm Bandit-based sampling algorithm that balances the diversity and quality of generated data. Extensive experiments on tabular classification and regression benchmarks demonstrate that DATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods. On average, DATE achieves a 23.75% reduction in error rate with just 100 generated data. Empirically, we demonstrate that data generated by DATE can improve the accuracy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs on the target data.

If the link is wrong, however, inferred rewards can be biased and policies be misaligned. We study policy alignment to preferences under an unknown and unrestricted link. We consider an $f$-divergence-constrained reward maximization problem and show that realizability of the solution in a policy class implies a semiparametric single-index binary choice model, where a scalar-valued index determined by a policy captures the dependence on demonstrations and the rest of the preference distribution is an unrestricted function thereof. Rather than focus on estimation of identifiable finite-dimensional structural parameters in the index as in econometrics, we focus on policy learning, focusing on error to the optimal policy and allowing unidentifiable and nonparametric indices. We develop a variety of policy learners based on profiling the link function, orthogonalizing the link function, and using link-agnostic bipartite ranking objectives.

Prior work primarily focuses on either the online setting where an agent learns about the unknown environment through iterative interactions, or the offline setting where a policy is learned solely from logged data. However, each of these paradigms has inherent limitations: online algorithms suffer from high interaction costs and slow adaptation, while offline methods are constrained by dataset quality and lack of exploration capabilities. To address these complementary weaknesses, we propose hybrid CMAB-T, a new framework that integrates offline data with online interaction in a principled manner. Our proposed hybrid CUCB algorithm leverages offline data to guide exploration and accelerate convergence, while strategically incorporating online interactions to mitigate the insufficient coverage or distributional bias of the offline dataset. We provide theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's regret, demonstrating that hybrid CUCB significantly outperforms purely online approaches when high-quality offline data is available, and effectively corrects the bias inherent in offline-only methods when the data is limited or misaligned.

Our approach leverages pre-trained ESM-2 protein language model embeddings, combining 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for local motif detection with Transformer encoders for global contextual representation. A subsequent fusion module integrates these multi-faceted features, which are then passed to a fully connected network for final score regression. Experimental results demonstrate that DuaDeep-SeqAffinity significantly outperforms individual architectural components and existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. DuaDeep achieved a superior Pearson correlation of 0.688, an R^2 of 0.460, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.737, surpassing single-branch variants ESM-CNN and ESM-Transformer. Notably, the model achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.890, outperforming sequence-only benchmarks and even surpassing structure-sequence hybrid models. These findings prove that high-fidelity sequence embeddings can capture essential binding patterns typically reserved for structural modeling.

However, conventional attack-based a posteriori robustness assessments incur prohibitive computational overhead. Recently, deep learning methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have been widely employed as surrogates for rapid robustness prediction. Nevertheless, these methods neglect the complex higher-order correlations prevalent in real-world systems, which are naturally modeled as hypergraphs. Although Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted for hypergraph learning, their topological expressive power has not yet reached the theoretical upper bound. To address this limitation, inspired by Graph Isomorphism Networks, this paper proposes a hypergraph-level Hypergraph Isomorphism Network framework. Theoretically, this approach is proven to possess an expressive power strictly equivalent to the Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test and is applied to predict hypergraph robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that while maintaining superior efficiency in training and prediction, the proposed method not only outperforms existing graph-based models but also significantly surpasses conventional HGNNs in tasks that prioritize topological structure representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8d85\u56fe\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u8d85\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u653b\u51fb\u5f0f\u540e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982CNN\u3001GNN\uff09\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u8d85\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08HGNN\uff09\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8d85\u56fe\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8d85\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e25\u683c\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u8d85\u56feWeisfeiler-Lehman\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u56fe\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5f3a\u8c03\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfHGNN\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8d85\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u9ad8\u9636\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

While the field has evolved with diverse methods, this rapid surge in diverse methodologies has culminated in a fragmented research landscape. The lack of a unified framework, including inconsistent implementations, conflicting dependencies, and varying evaluation protocols, makes fair comparison and reproducible research increasingly difficult. To address this challenge, we propose LibContinual, a comprehensive and reproducible library designed to serve as a foundational platform for realistic CL. Built upon a high-cohesion, low-coupling modular architecture, LibContinual integrates 19 representative algorithms across five major methodological categories, providing a standardized execution environment. Meanwhile, leveraging this unified framework, we systematically identify and investigate three implicit assumptions prevalent in mainstream evaluation: (1) offline data accessibility, (2) unregulated memory resources, and (3) intra-task semantic homogeneity. We argue that these assumptions often overestimate the real-world applicability of CL methods. Through our comprehensive analysis using strict online CL settings, a novel unified memory budget protocol, and a proposed category-randomized setting, we reveal significant performance drops in many representative CL methods when subjected to these real-world constraints. Our study underscores the necessity of resource-aware and semantically robust CL strategies, and offers LibContinual as a foundational toolkit for future research in realistic continual learning.

Despite advancements in virtual screening, these methods remain time-consuming and costly. Recent progress in deep learning has enabled the development of generative models capable of learning complex molecular representations and generating novel compounds de novo. However, using ML to replace the entire drug-discovery pipeline is highly challenging. In this work, we rather investigate whether generative models can replace one step of the pipeline: hit-like molecule generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly frame hit-like molecule generation as a standalone task and empirically test whether generative models can directly support this stage of the drug discovery pipeline. Specifically, we investigate if such models can be trained to generate hit-like molecules, enabling direct incorporation into, or even substitution of, traditional hit identification workflows. We propose an evaluation framework tailored to this task, integrating physicochemical, structural, and bioactivity-related criteria within a multi-stage filtering pipeline that defines the hit-like chemical space. Two autoregressive and one diffusion-based generative models were benchmarked across various datasets and training settings, with outputs assessed using standard metrics and target-specific docking scores.

Yet, while empirically validated, its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood. This work formalizes the learning dynamics of transformer-based language models as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, then approximates this process to kernel behaviors. Departing from prior toy-model analyses, we rigorously analyze stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training for multi-layer transformers on sequence-to-sequence data with arbitrary data distribution, closely mirroring real-world conditions. Our analysis characterizes the convergence of generalization error to the irreducible risk as computational resources scale with data, especially during the optimization process.\n  We establish a theoretical upper bound on excess risk characterized by a distinct phase transition. In the initial optimization phase, the excess risk decays exponentially relative to the computational cost ${\\sf C}$. However, once a specific resource allocation threshold is crossed, the system enters a statistical phase, where the generalization error follows a power-law decay of $\u0398(\\mathsf{C}^{-1/6})$. Beyond this unified framework, our theory derives isolated scaling laws for model size, training time, and dataset size, elucidating how each variable independently governs the upper bounds of generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3aTransformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u5173\u7cfb\uff1a\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u9636\u6bb5\u9075\u5faa\u5e42\u5f8b\u8870\u51cf\u0398(C^{-1/6})\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5728LLM\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u591a\u5c42Transformer\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Transformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u6838\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u5c42Transformer\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684SGD\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u9636\u6bb5\u9075\u5faa\u5e42\u5f8b\u8870\u51cf\u0398(C^{-1/6})\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aLLM\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u9608\u503c\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We present A2P-Vis, a two-part, multi-agent pipeline that turns raw datasets into a high-quality data-visualization report. The Data Analyzer orchestrates profiling, proposes diverse visualization directions, generates and executes plotting code, filters low-quality figures with a legibility checker, and elicits candidate insights that are automatically scored for depth, correctness, specificity, depth and actionability. The Presenter then orders topics, composes chart-grounded narratives from the top-ranked insights, writes justified transitions, and revises the document for clarity and consistency, yielding a coherent, publication-ready report. Together, these agents convert raw data into curated materials (charts + vetted insights) and into a readable narrative without manual glue work. We claim that by coupling a quality-assured Analyzer with a narrative Presenter, A2P-Vis operationalizes co-analysis end-to-end, improving the real-world usefulness of automated data analysis for practitioners.

However, existing methods lack principled tools to disentangle and quantify the individual contributions of each modality and their interactions, limiting the interpretability of multimodal fusion. We propose a novel multimodal regression framework grounded in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes modality-specific representations into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. The basic PID framework is inherently underdetermined. To resolve this, we introduce inductive bias by enforcing Gaussianity in the joint distribution of latent representations and the transformed response variable (after inverse normal transformation), thereby enabling analytical computation of the PID terms. Additionally, we derive a closed-form conditional independence regularizer to promote the isolation of unique information within each modality. Experiments on six real-world datasets, including a case study on large-scale brain age prediction from multimodal neuroimaging data, demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability, while also enabling informed modality selection for efficient inference.

In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed using LAMMPS to model aluminum friction stir welding at the atomic scale, capturing material flow, plastic deformation, and heat generation during tool plunge, traverse, and retraction. Atomic positions and velocities were extracted from simulation trajectories and transformed into physics based two dimensional spatial grids. These grids represent local height variation, velocity components, velocity magnitude, and atomic density, preserving spatial correlations within the weld zone. A two-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed to predict temperature directly from the spatially resolved atomistic data. Hyperparameter optimization was carried out to determine an appropriate network configuration. The trained model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving a coefficient of determination R square of 0.9439, a root mean square error of 14.94 K, and a mean absolute error of 11.58 K on unseen test data. Class Activation Map analysis indicates that the model assigns higher importance to regions near the tool material interface, which are associated with intense deformation and heat generation in the molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that spatial learning from atomistic simulation data can accurately reproduce temperature trends in friction stir welding while remaining consistent with physical deformation and flow mechanisms observed at the atomic scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u94dd\u7684\u6405\u62cc\u6469\u64e6\u710a\u63a5\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u6e29\u5ea6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0aR\u00b2\u8fbe0.9439\uff0c\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u710a\u63a5\u533a\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6e29\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u6405\u62cc\u6469\u64e6\u710a\u63a5\u7684\u70ed\u673a\u68b0\u884c\u4e3a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6355\u6349\u6750\u6599\u6d41\u52a8\u3001\u5851\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u70ed\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LAMMPS\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u94dd\u7684\u6405\u62cc\u6469\u64e6\u710a\u63a5\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u539f\u5b50\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f51\u683c\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u5206\u91cf\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u539f\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff09\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u6e29\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u51b3\u5b9a\u7cfb\u6570R\u00b2\u4e3a0.9439\uff0c\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee14.94K\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee11.58K\u3002\u7c7b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5de5\u5177-\u6750\u6599\u754c\u9762\u9644\u8fd1\u533a\u57df\u8d4b\u4e88\u66f4\u9ad8\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u4e0e\u5f3a\u70c8\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u70ed\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u539f\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u518d\u73b0\u6405\u62cc\u6469\u64e6\u710a\u63a5\u4e2d\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u6d41\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

When reasoning about the possibility of consistency violations, it can be helpful to distinguish between covariates and versions of treatment. In the context of surgery, for example, genomic variables are covariates and the skill of a particular surgeon is a version of treatment. There may be hidden versions of treatment, and this paper addresses that concern with a new kind of sensitivity analysis.

However, current laboratory and point-of-care testing systems are limited by long turnaround times, narrow dynamic ranges for the tested biomarkers, and single-analyte formats that fail to capture the complexity of cardiovascular disease. Here, we present a deep learning-enhanced dual-mode multiplexed vertical flow assay (xVFA) with a portable optical reader and a neural network-based quantification pipeline. This optical sensor integrates colorimetric and chemiluminescent detection within a single paper-based cartridge to complementarily cover a large dynamic range (spanning ~6 orders of magnitude) for both low- and high-abundance biomarkers, while maintaining quantitative accuracy. Using 50 uL of serum, the optical sensor simultaneously quantifies cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) within 23 min. The xVFA achieves sub-pg/mL sensitivity for cTnI and sub-ng/mL sensitivity for CK-MB and NT-proBNP, spanning the clinically relevant ranges for these biomarkers. Neural network models trained and blindly tested on 92 patient serum samples yielded a robust quantification performance (Pearson's r > 0.96 vs. reference assays).

For example, the coding technique used to fortify data in a modern storage system when the device is fresh cannot be the same as that used when the device ages. Therefore, providing reconfigurable coding schemes and devising an effective way to perform this reconfiguration are key to extending the device lifetime. We focus on constrained coding schemes for the emerging two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) technology. Recently, we have designed efficient lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) coding schemes for various stages of the TDMR device lifetime, focusing on the elimination of isolation patterns, and demonstrated remarkable gains by using them. LOCO codes are naturally reconfigurable, and we exploit this feature in our work. Reconfiguration based on predetermined time stamps, which is what the industry adopts, neglects the actual device status. Instead, we propose offline and online learning methods to perform this task based on the device status. In offline learning, training data is assumed to be available throughout the time span of interest, while in online learning, we only use training data at specific time intervals to make consequential decisions. We fit the training data to polynomial equations that give the bit error rate in terms of TD density, then design an optimization problem in order to reach the optimal reconfiguration decisions to switch from a coding scheme to another. The objective is to maximize the storage capacity and/or minimize the decoding complexity. The problem reduces to a linear programming problem. We show that our solution is the global optimal based on problem characteristics, and we offer various experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in TDMR systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bbe\u5907\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u7ef4\u78c1\u8bb0\u5f55\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u89e3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u65b0\u9c9c\u65f6\u548c\u8001\u5316\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u6280\u672f\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bbe\u5907\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5ef6\u957f\u8bbe\u5907\u5bff\u547d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u7528\u6574\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u62df\u5408\u4e3a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u4e0e\u4e8c\u7ef4\u78c1\u8bb0\u5f55\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u53ef\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff09\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u6027\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u78c1\u8bb0\u5f55\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u89e3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bbe\u5907\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8c\u7ef4\u78c1\u8bb0\u5f55\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5ef6\u957f\u8bbe\u5907\u5bff\u547d\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Broadly, these frameworks leverage VLMs and a pre-specified toolbox to decompose the prediction task into multiple tool calls (often deep learning models) which are composed to make a prediction. The dominant approach to composing tools is using text, via function calls embedded in VLM-generated code or natural language. However, these methods often perform poorly on medical image understanding, where salient information is encoded as spatially-localized features that are difficult to compose or fuse via text alone. To address this, we propose a tool-use framework for medical image understanding called the Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF), which composes VLM-selected tools using a learned Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM). For a given image and task, TBF leverages an off-the-shelf medical VLM to select tools from a toolbox that each extract clinically-relevant features. Instead of text-based composition, these tools are composed by the TBM, which computes and fuses the tool outputs using a neural network before outputting the final prediction. We propose a simple and effective strategy for TBMs to make predictions with any arbitrary VLM tool selection. Overall, our framework not only improves tool-use in medical imaging contexts, but also yields more interpretable, clinically-grounded predictors. We evaluate TBF on tasks in histopathology and dermatology and find that these advantages enable our framework to perform on par with or better than deep learning-based classifiers, VLMs, and state-of-the-art tool-use frameworks, with particular gains in data-limited regimes.

We introduce DynAttn, an interpretable dynamic-attention forecasting framework for high-dimensional spatio-temporal count processes. DynAttn combines rolling-window estimation, shared elastic-net feature gating, a compact weight-tied self-attention encoder, and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) likelihood. This architecture produces calibrated multi-horizon forecasts of expected casualties and exceedance probabilities, while retaining transparent diagnostics through feature gates, ablation analysis, and elasticity measures.\n  We evaluate DynAttn using global country-level and high-resolution PRIO-grid-level conflict data from the VIEWS forecasting system, benchmarking it against established statistical and machine-learning approaches, including DynENet, LSTM, Prophet, PatchTST, and the official VIEWS baseline. Across forecast horizons from one to twelve months, DynAttn consistently achieves substantially higher predictive accuracy, with particularly large gains in sparse grid-level settings where competing models often become unstable or degrade sharply.\n  Beyond predictive performance, DynAttn enables structured interpretation of regional conflict dynamics. In our application, cross-regional analyses show that short-run conflict persistence and spatial diffusion form the core predictive backbone, while climate stress acts either as a conditional amplifier or a primary driver depending on the conflict theater.", "AI": {"tldr": "DynAttn\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u8ba1\u6570\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u6b7b\u4ea1\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u533a\u57df\u51b2\u7a81\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b2\u7a81\u76f8\u5173\u6b7b\u4ea1\u9884\u6d4b\u662f\u653f\u6cbb\u5b66\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u66b4\u529b\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u7a81\u53d1\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "DynAttn\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6eda\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u5171\u4eab\u5f39\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\u95e8\u63a7\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u6743\u91cd\u5171\u4eab\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u96f6\u81a8\u80c0\u8d1f\u4e8c\u9879\u5f0f\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u591a\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8d85\u9650\u6982\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5168\u7403\u56fd\u5bb6\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387PRIO\u7f51\u683c\u7ea7\u51b2\u7a81\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cDynAttn\u57281-12\u4e2a\u6708\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u59cb\u7ec8\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u7f51\u683c\u7ea7\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "DynAttn\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u533a\u57df\u51b2\u7a81\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u77ed\u671f\u51b2\u7a81\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u662f\u6838\u5fc3\u9884\u6d4b\u652f\u67f1\uff0c\u800c\u6c14\u5019\u538b\u529b\u6839\u636e\u51b2\u7a81\u533a\u57df\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u653e\u5927\u5668\u6216\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

We present COMETH (Contextual Organization of Moral Evaluation from Textual Human inputs), a framework that integrates a probabilistic context learner with LLM-based semantic abstraction and human moral evaluations to model how context shapes the acceptability of ambiguous actions. We curate an empirically grounded dataset of 300 scenarios across six core actions (violating Do not kill, Do not deceive, and Do not break the law) and collect ternary judgments (Blame/Neutral/Support) from N=101 participants. A preprocessing pipeline standardizes actions via an LLM filter and MiniLM embeddings with K-means, producing robust, reproducible core-action clusters. COMETH then learns action-specific moral contexts by clustering scenarios online from human judgment distributions using principled divergence criteria. To generalize and explain predictions, a Generalization module extracts concise, non-evaluative binary contextual features and learns feature weights in a transparent likelihood-based model. Empirically, COMETH roughly doubles alignment with majority human judgments relative to end-to-end LLM prompting (approx. 60% vs. approx. 30% on average), while revealing which contextual features drive its predictions. The contributions are: (i) an empirically grounded moral-context dataset, (ii) a reproducible pipeline combining human judgments with model-based context learning and LLM semantics, and (iii) an interpretable alternative to end-to-end LLMs for context-sensitive moral prediction and explanation.", "AI": {"tldr": "COMETH\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3001LLM\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u9053\u5fb7\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7aef\u5230\u7aefLLM\u63d0\u793a\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea6\u4e00\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d7\u5230\u60c5\u5883(context)\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aefLLM\u5728\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u60c5\u5883\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b300\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\"\u4e0d\u6740\u751f\"\u3001\"\u4e0d\u6b3a\u9a97\"\u3001\"\u4e0d\u8fdd\u6cd5\"\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6536\u96c6101\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u4e09\u5143\u5224\u65ad\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548cMiniLM\u5d4c\u5165+K-means\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b3) COMETH\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u805a\u7c7b\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u60c5\u5883\uff1b4) \u6cdb\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u60c5\u5883\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u900f\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "COMETH\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u591a\u6570\u5224\u65ad\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u4ece\u7aef\u5230\u7aefLLM\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u7ea630%\u63d0\u9ad8\u5230\u7ea660%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea6\u4e00\u500d\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "COMETH\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\uff1a1) \u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u60c5\u5883\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b2) \u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u60c5\u5883\u5b66\u4e60\u548cLLM\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b3) \u7528\u4e8e\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u9053\u5fb7\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aefLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a novel framework to resolve the intractability with an Orthogonal Decomposition of the Tangent Space ($T_fM=S \\oplus S^{\\perp}$), where S represents an observable covariate subspace. Through the decomposition, we derive the Covariate Fisher Information Matrix (cFIM), denoted as $G_f$, which is a finite-dimensional and computable representative of information extractable from the manifold's geometry. Indeed, by proving the Trace Theorem: $H_G(f)=\\text{Tr}(G_f)$, we establish a rigorous foundation for the G-entropy previously introduced by us, thereby identifying it not merely as a gradient-based regularizer, but also as a fundamental geometric invariant representing the total explainable statistical information captured by the probability distribution associated with the model. Furthermore, we establish a link between $G_f$ and the second-order derivative (i.e. the curvature) of the KL-divergence, leading to the notion of Covariate Cram\u00e9r-Rao Lower Bound(CRLB). We demonstrate that $G_f$ is congruent to the Efficient Fisher Information Matrix, thereby providing fundamental limits of variance for semi-parametric estimators. Finally, we apply our geometric framework to the Manifold Hypothesis, lifting the latter from a heuristic assumption into a testable condition of rank-deficiency within the cFIM. By defining the Information Capture Ratio, we provide a rigorous method for estimating intrinsic dimensionality in high-dimensional data. In short, our work bridges the gap between abstract information geometry and the demand of explainable AI, by providing a tractable path for revealing the statistical coverage and the efficiency of non-parametric models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u4ea4\u5206\u89e3\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u534f\u53d8\u91cfFisher\u4fe1\u606f\u77e9\u9635(cFIM)\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u7684\"\u96be\u5904\u7406\u6027\u969c\u788d\"\uff0c\u5efa\u7acbG-\u71b5\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5KL\u6563\u5ea6\u66f2\u7387\u548cCram\u00e9r-Rao\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u9762\u4e34\"\u96be\u5904\u7406\u6027\u969c\u788d\"\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aFisher-Rao\u5ea6\u91cf\u662f\u6cdb\u51fd\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4e49\u5176\u9006\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8fde\u63a5\u62bd\u8c61\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u5206\u89e3\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4(T_fM=S\u2295S^\u22a5)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dS\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u534f\u53d8\u91cfFisher\u4fe1\u606f\u77e9\u9635(cFIM)\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u8ff9\u5b9a\u7406\u8fde\u63a5G-\u71b5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660ecFIM\u4e0e\u6709\u6548Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u77e9\u9635\u540c\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f62\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "cFIM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u53ef\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u8868\uff0c\u4e3aG-\u71b5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u534f\u53d8\u91cfCram\u00e9r-Rao\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5c06\u6d41\u5f62\u5047\u8bbe\u4ece\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u5347\u4e3acFIM\u79e9\u4e8f\u7f3a\u7684\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f30\u8ba1\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u62bd\u8c61\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Currently, reconstruction-based and unsupervised representation-based approaches are the primary focus. However, unsupervised representation-based methods struggle to extract robust features under domain shift, whereas reconstruction-based methods often suffer from low training efficiency and performance degradation due to insufficient constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection (CCAD). CCAD synergizes the strengths of both paradigms by adapting global features as a new modality condition for the reconstruction model. Furthermore, we design an adaptive compression mechanism to enhance both generalization and training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC while achieving faster convergence.

This paper develops two complementary quantum formulations of the NDWT that embed these classical properties coherently into quantum computation. The first formulation is based on the epsilon-decimated interpretation of the NDWT and realizes all circularly shifted wavelet transforms simultaneously by promoting the shift index to a quantum register and applying controlled circular shifts followed by a wavelet analysis unitary. The resulting construction yields an explicit, fully unitary quantum representation of redundant wavelet coefficients and supports coherent postprocessing, including quantum shrinkage via ancilla-driven completely positive trace preserving maps. The second formulation is based on the Hadamard test and uses diagonal phase operators to probe scale-shift wavelet structure through interference, providing direct access to shift-invariant energy scalograms and multiscale spectra without explicit coefficient reconstruction. Together, these two approaches demonstrate that redundancy and translation invariance can be exploited rather than avoided in the quantum setting. Applications to denoising, feature extraction, and spectral scaling illustrate how quantum NDWTs provide a flexible and physically meaningful foundation for multiscale quantum signal processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u975e\u62bd\u53d6\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\uff08NDWT\uff09\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u975e\u62bd\u53d6\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u800c\u975e\u907f\u514d\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u03b5-\u62bd\u53d6\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u5b58\u50a8\u5e73\u79fb\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5e73\u79fb\u548c\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u6790\u9149\u7b97\u5b50\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eHadamard\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u89d2\u76f8\u4f4d\u7b97\u5b50\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u6d89\u63a2\u6d4b\u5c3a\u5ea6-\u5e73\u79fb\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u878d\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u76f8\u5e72\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u91cf\u5b50\u6536\u7f29\uff09\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u80fd\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56fe\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8c31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50NDWT\u4e3a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u800c\u975e\u907f\u514d\u3002"}}

Why is this the case? We walk through definitions of hallucination used in the literature from a historical perspective up to the current day, and fold them into a single definition of hallucination, wherein different prior definitions focus on different aspects of our definition. At its core, we argue that hallucination is simply inaccurate (internal) world modeling, in a form where it is observable to the user (e.g., stating a fact which contradicts a knowledge base, or producing a summary which contradicts a known source). By varying the reference world model as well as the knowledge conflict policy (e.g., knowledge base vs. in-context), we arrive at the different existing definitions of hallucination present in the literature.\n  We argue that this unified view is useful because it forces evaluations to make clear their assumed \"world\" or source of truth, clarifies what should and should not be called hallucination (as opposed to planning or reward/incentive-related errors), and provides a common language to compare benchmarks and mitigation techniques. Building on this definition, we outline plans for a family of benchmarks in which hallucinations are defined as mismatches with synthetic but fully specified world models in different environments, and sketch out how these benchmarks can use such settings to stress-test and improve the world modeling components of language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u5b9a\u4e49\uff1a\u5e7b\u89c9\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u88ab\u7528\u6237\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u65f6\uff08\u5982\u9648\u8ff0\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff09\uff0c\u5c31\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8bde\u751f\u4ee5\u6765\u5c31\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u89e3\u51b3\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5404\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5171\u540c\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u89d2\u5ea6\u68b3\u7406\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5e7b\u89c9=\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21+\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u73b0\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u5b9a\u4e49\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u5176\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\"\u4e16\u754c\"\u6216\u771f\u76f8\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u4ec0\u4e48\u5e94\u8be5/\u4e0d\u5e94\u8be5\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u5e7b\u89c9\uff08\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u6216\u5956\u52b1\u76f8\u5173\u9519\u8bef\u533a\u5206\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u4f46\u5b8c\u5168\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bb6\u65cf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u57fa\u51c6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002"}}

Recent spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) excel in multi-node optimization and spin glass simulations, leveraging their large-scale and fully connected characteristics. However, existing laser diffraction-based SPIMs usually sacrifice time efficiency or spin count to encode high-rank spin-spin coupling and external fields, limiting their scalability for real-world applications. Here, we demonstrate an amplitude-only modulated rank-free spatial photonic Ising machine (AR-SPIM) with 200 iterations per second. By re-formulating an arbitrary Ising Hamiltonian as the sum of Hadamard products, followed by loading the corresponding matrices/vectors onto an aligned amplitude spatial light modulator and digital micro-mirrors device, we directly map a 797-spin Ising model with external fields (nearly 9-bit precision, -255 to 255) into an incoherent light field, eliminating the need for repeated and auxiliary operations.

As a result, the model must simultaneously represent the global structure of the distribution and its fine-scale local variations, which becomes difficult when these scales are strongly mismatched. This issue arises both in natural images, where coarse manifold-level structure and fine textures coexist, and in low-dimensional distributions with highly concentrated local structure. To address this issue, we propose Residual Prior Diffusion (RPD), a two-stage framework in which a coarse prior model first captures the large-scale structure of the data distribution, and a diffusion model is then trained to represent the residual between the prior and the target data distribution. We formulate RPD as an explicit probabilistic model with a tractable evidence lower bound, whose optimization reduces to the familiar objectives of noise prediction or velocity prediction. We further introduce auxiliary variables that leverage information from the prior model and theoretically analyze how they reduce the difficulty of the prediction problem in RPD. Experiments on synthetic datasets with fine-grained local structure show that standard diffusion models fail to capture local details, whereas RPD accurately captures fine-scale detail while preserving the large-scale structure of the distribution. On natural image generation tasks, RPD achieved generation quality that matched or exceeded that of representative diffusion-based baselines and it maintained strong performance even with a small number of inference steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faResidual Prior Diffusion (RPD)\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5355\u4e00\u6269\u6563\u8ba1\u5212\u5c06\u7b80\u5355\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u5982\u6807\u51c6\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u8868\u793a\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ec6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c40\u90e8\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5f53\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6d41\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7eb9\u7406\u5171\u5b58\uff0c\u6216\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faResidual Prior Diffusion (RPD)\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2\uff09\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u793a\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u3002\u5c06RPD\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u9884\u6d4b\u6216\u901f\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5229\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u964d\u4f4eRPD\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800cRPD\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cRPD\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u52b2\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RPD\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We propose SemDAC, a semantic-aware neural audio codec that leverages semantic codebooks as effective priors for speech compression. In SemDAC, the first quantizer in a residual vector quantization (RVQ) stack is distilled from HuBERT features to produce semantic tokens that capture phonetic content, while subsequent quantizers model residual acoustics. A FiLM-conditioned decoder reconstructs audio conditioned on the semantic tokens, improving efficiency in the use of acoustic codebooks. Despite its simplicity, this design proves highly effective: SemDAC outperforms DAC across perceptual metrics and achieves lower WER when running Whisper on reconstructed speech, all while operating at substantially lower bitrates (e.g., 0.95 kbps vs. 2.5 kbps for DAC).

In this paper we present a mechanistic interpretability framework for deepfake detection applied to a vision-language model. Our approach combines a sparse autoencoder (SAE) analysis of internal network representations with a novel forensic manifold analysis that probes how the model's features respond to controlled forensic artifact manipulations. We demonstrate that only a small fraction of latent features are actively used in each layer, and that the geometric properties of the model's feature manifold, including intrinsic dimensionality, curvature, and feature selectivity, vary systematically with different types of deepfake artifacts. These insights provide a first step toward opening the \"black box\" of deepfake detectors, allowing us to identify which learned features correspond to specific forensic artifacts and to guide the development of more interpretable and robust models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u6790\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u6cd5\u8bc1\u6d41\u5f62\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6253\u5f00\u8fd9\u4e2a\"\u9ed1\u76d2\"\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u6210\u5a92\u4f53", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u6790\u5185\u90e8\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u6cd5\u8bc1\u6d41\u5f62\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6cd5\u8bc1\u4f2a\u5f71\u64cd\u4f5c\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u54cd\u5e94", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6bcf\u5c42\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u91cf\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u88ab\u4e3b\u52a8\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u66f2\u7387\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6027\uff09\u968f\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u4f2a\u5f71\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53d8\u5316", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u6253\u5f00\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\"\u9ed1\u76d2\"\u8fc8\u51fa\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u54ea\u4e9b\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u5e94\u7279\u5b9a\u6cd5\u8bc1\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6a21\u578b"}}

In this paper, we compare the performance of DL models, including YOLO-NAS and YOLOv8, for a detection-based perception task. We capture a custom dataset and experiment with both DL models using our custom dataset. Our analysis reveals that the YOLOv8s model saves 75% of training time compared to the YOLO-NAS model. In addition, the YOLOv8s model (83%) outperforms the YOLO-NAS model (81%) when the target is to achieve the highest object detection accuracy.

However, this fast development has prompted increased scrutiny concerning user privacy and the use of copyrighted works in training. A recent attack on machine-learning models called membership inference lies at the crossroads of these two concerns. The attack is given as input a set of records and a trained model and seeks to identify which of those records may have been used to train the model. On one hand, this attack can be used to identify user data used to train a model, which may violate their privacy especially in sensitive applications such as models trained on medical data. On the other hand, this attack can be used by rights-holders as evidence that a company used their works without permission to train a model.\n  Remarkably, it appears that no work has studied the effect of membership inference attacks (MIA) on generative music. Given that the music industry is worth billions of dollars and artists would stand to gain from being able to determine if their works were being used without permission, we believe this is a pressing issue to study. As such, in this work we begin a preliminary study into whether MIAs are effective on generative music.

Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are state-of-the-art solution for 2D, have a hard time capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships, especially when 75% of tokens are discarded during pre-training. We propose BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking using Swin Transformer windows, to enhance spatial context learning in 3D during SSL pre-training. Unlike the classic MAE, which processes only visible areas, BertsWin introduces a complete 3D grid of tokens (masked and visible), preserving the spatial topology. And to smooth out the quadratic complexity of ViT, single-level local Swin windows are used. We introduce a structural priority loss function and evaluate the results of cone beam computed tomography of the temporomandibular joints. The subsequent assessment includes TMJ segmentation on 3D CT scans. We demonstrate that the BertsWin architecture, by maintaining a complete three-dimensional spatial topology, inherently accelerates semantic convergence by a factor of 5.8x compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. Furthermore, when coupled with our proposed GradientConductor optimizer, the full BertsWin framework achieves a 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) required to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Analysis reveals that BertsWin achieves this acceleration without the computational penalty typically associated with dense volumetric processing. At canonical input resolutions, the architecture maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines, resulting in a significant net reduction in total computational resources due to faster convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBertsWin\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408BERT\u98ce\u683c\u5168token\u63a9\u7801\u548cSwin Transformer\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e3D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6ViT-MAE\u52a0\u901f5.8\u500d\u8bed\u4e49\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1115\u500d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548cVision Transformers\u57282D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u57283D\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u6807\u51c6MAE\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e22\u5f0375% token\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBertsWin\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528BERT\u98ce\u683c\u5168token\u63a9\u7801\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u89c1\u548c\u63a9\u7801token\uff09\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u65743D\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528Swin Transformer\u5355\u5c42\u5c40\u90e8\u7a97\u53e3\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff1b4) \u7ed3\u5408GradientConductor\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "1) \u8bed\u4e49\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6ViT-MAE\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb5.8\u500d\uff1b2) \u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6240\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u51cf\u5c1115\u500d\uff0844\u8f6e vs 660\u8f6e\uff09\uff1b3) \u5728\u6807\u51c6\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u8bbaFLOP\u4e0e\u7a00\u758fViT\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b4) \u5728TMJ\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "BertsWin\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u6574\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f3D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u5bc6\u96c6\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We argue that automating objective function design is a central, yet unmet requirement for scientific discovery agents. In this work, we introduce the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA) to amend this challenge. SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs. We demonstrate the framework through a broad spectrum of applications, including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design, showing that automating objective formulation can substantially improve the effectiveness of scientific discovery agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAGA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5916\u5c42LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5185\u5c42\u6267\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u7406\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5f80\u5f80\u53ea\u662f\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cd\u5927\u79d1\u5b66\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u76ee\u6807\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u6267\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u76ee\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ca\u5176\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6297\u751f\u7d20\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u65e0\u673a\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u6027DNA\u5e8f\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5236\u5b9a\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\uff0cSAGA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We introduce Distributionally Robust Adaptive Mechanism (DRAM), a general framework combining insights from both mechanism design and online learning to jointly address truthfulness and cost-optimality. Throughout the sequential game, the mechanism estimates agents' beliefs and iteratively updates a distributionally robust linear program with shrinking ambiguity sets to reduce payments while preserving truthfulness.

Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets).

The approach, Tilt Matching, arises from a dynamical equation relating the flow matching velocity to one targeting the same distribution tilted by a reward, implicitly solving a stochastic optimal control problem. The new velocity inherits the regularity of stochastic interpolant transports while also being the minimizer of an objective with strictly lower variance than flow matching itself. The update to the velocity field can be interpreted as the sum of all joint cumulants of the stochastic interpolant and copies of the reward, and to first order is their covariance. The algorithms do not require any access to gradients of the reward or backpropagating through trajectories of the flow or diffusion. We empirically verify that the approach is efficient and highly scalable, providing state-of-the-art results on sampling under Lennard-Jones potentials and is competitive on fine-tuning Stable Diffusion, without requiring reward multipliers.

Existing methods can effectively extend the model for new tasks while freezing the parameters of the old model, but ignore the necessity of structural efficiency to lead to the feature difference between modules and the class misalignment due to evolving class distributions. To address these issues, we propose scalable class-incremental learning based on parametric neural collapse (SCL-PNC) that enables demand-driven, minimal-cost backbone expansion by adapt-layer and refines the static into a dynamic parametric Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) framework according to incremental class. This method can efficiently handle the model expansion question with the increasing number of categories in real-world scenarios. Additionally, to counteract feature drift in serial expansion models, the parallel expansion framework is presented with a knowledge distillation algorithm to align features across expansion modules. Therefore, SCL-PNC can not only design a dynamic and extensible ETF classifier to address class misalignment due to evolving class distributions, but also ensure feature consistency by an adapt-layer with knowledge distillation between extended modules. By leveraging neural collapse, SCL-PNC induces the convergence of the incremental expansion model through a structured combination of the expandable backbone, adapt-layer, and the parametric ETF classifier. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangchuangxin71-cyber/dynamic_ ETF2.

This work investigates whether feature-level fusion of complementary convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones can deliver accurate and efficient binary DR screening on globally sourced fundus images. Using 11,156 images pooled from five public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, IDRiD, Messidor, and ODIR), we frame DR detection as a binary classification task and compare three pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants. Across five independent runs, fusion consistently outperforms single backbones. The EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 (Eff+Den) fusion model achieves the best overall mean performance (accuracy: 82.89\\%) with balanced class-wise F1-scores for normal (83.60\\%) and diabetic (82.60\\%) cases. While the tri-fusion is competitive, it incurs a substantially higher computational cost. Inference profiling highlights a practical trade-off: EfficientNet-B0 is the fastest (approximately 1.16 ms/image at batch size 1000), whereas the Eff+Den fusion offers a favorable accuracy--latency balance.

However, crafting appealing posters and manually optimizing them based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming. To address this, we introduce AutoPP, an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates the need for human intervention. Specifically, the generator, relying solely on basic product information, first uses a unified design module to integrate the three key elements of a poster (background, text, and layout) into a cohesive output. Then, an element rendering module encodes these elements into condition tokens, efficiently and controllably generating the product poster. Based on the generated poster, the optimizer enhances its Click-Through Rate (CTR) by leveraging online feedback. It systematically replaces elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and utilizes Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements. Our work is supported by AutoPP1M, the largest dataset specifically designed for product poster generation and optimization, which contains one million high-quality posters and feedback collected from over one million users.

For such an underexplored enhancement task, we first curate images from various sources and construct an unpaired anime scenery dataset with diverse environments and illumination conditions to address the data scarcity. To exploit the power of uncertainty information inherent with the diverse illumination conditions, we propose a Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework, motivated by the idea from Relativistic GAN. By analogy with the wave-particle duality of light, our framework interpretably defines and quantifies the illumination uncertainty of dark/bright samples, which is leveraged to dynamically adjust the objective functions to recalibrate the model learning under data uncertainty.

The {\\em spherical cluster model} (SC) approximates a finite point set $P\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ by a sphere $S(c,r)$ as follows. Taking $r$ as a fraction $\u03b7\\in(0,1)$ (hyper-parameter) of the std deviation of distances between the center $c$ and the data points, the cost of the SC model is the sum over all data points lying outside the sphere $S$ of their power distance with respect to $S$. The center $c$ of the SC model is the point minimizing this cost. Note that $\u03b7=0$ yields the celebrated center of mass used in KMeans clustering. We make three contributions.\n  First, we show fitting a spherical cluster yields a strictly convex but not smooth combinatorial optimization problem. Second, we present an exact solver using the Clarke gradient on a suitable stratified cell complex defined from an arrangement of hyper-spheres. Finally, we present experiments on a variety of datasets ranging in dimension from $d=9$ to $d=10,000$, with two main observations. First, the exact algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than BFGS based heuristics for datasets of small/intermediate dimension and small values of $\u03b7$, and for high dimensional datasets (say $d>100$) whatever the value of $\u03b7$.

Recent studies attribute these hallucinations to VLMs' over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration, proposing heuristic decoding calibration strategies to mitigate them. However, the non-trainable nature of these strategies inherently limits their optimization potential. To this end, we propose an adversarial parametric editing framework for Hallucination mitigation in VLMs, which follows an \\textbf{A}ctivate-\\textbf{L}ocate-\\textbf{E}dit \\textbf{A}dversarially paradigm. Specifically, we first construct an activation dataset that comprises grounded responses (positive samples attentively anchored in visual features) and hallucinatory responses (negative samples reflecting LLM prior bias and internal knowledge artifacts). Next, we identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states of response pairs. Then, these clusters are fine-tuned using prompts injected with adversarial tuned prefixes that are optimized to maximize visual neglect, thereby forcing the model to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases.

This paper investigates the impact of on-chip SRAM size and operating frequency on the energy efficiency and performance of LLM inference, focusing on the distinct behaviors of the compute-bound prefill and memory-bound decode phases. Our simulation methodology combines OpenRAM for energy modeling, LLMCompass for latency simulation, and ScaleSIM for systolic array operational intensity. Our findings show that total energy use is predominantly determined by SRAM size in both phases, with larger buffers significantly increasing static energy due to leakage, which is not offset by corresponding latency benefits. We quantitatively explore the memory-bandwidth bottleneck, demonstrating that while high operating frequencies reduce prefill latency, their positive impact on memory-bound decode latency is capped by the external memory bandwidth. Counter-intuitively, high compute frequency can reduce total energy by reducing execution time and consequently decreasing static energy consumption more than the resulting dynamic power increase. We identify an optimal hardware configuration for the simulated workload: high operating frequencies (1200MHz-1400MHz) and a small local buffer size of 32KB to 64KB. This combination achieves the best energy-delay product, balancing low latency with high energy efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how memory bandwidth acts as a performance ceiling, and that increasing compute frequency only yields performance gains up to the point where the workload becomes memory-bound. This analysis provides concrete architectural insights for designing energy-efficient LLM accelerators, especially for datacenters aiming to minimize their energy overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7SRAM\u5927\u5c0f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5927\u7f13\u5b58\u589e\u52a0\u9759\u6001\u80fd\u8017\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e26\u6765\u76f8\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6536\u76ca\u3002\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9891\u7387\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e\u603b\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u7f6e\u4e3a1200-1400MHz\u9891\u7387\u548c32-64KB\u5c0f\u7f13\u5b58\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u786c\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fSRAM\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u9891\u7387\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7684LLM\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7efc\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528OpenRAM\u8fdb\u884c\u80fd\u8017\u5efa\u6a21\uff0cLLMCompass\u8fdb\u884c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4eff\u771f\uff0cScaleSIM\u5206\u6790\u8109\u52a8\u9635\u5217\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u91cd\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u80fd\u8017\u4e3b\u8981\u7531SRAM\u5927\u5c0f\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u5927\u7f13\u5b58\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u9759\u6001\u80fd\u8017\u4f46\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6536\u76ca\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u867d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u9884\u586b\u5145\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u6539\u5584\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u3002\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u5730\uff0c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9891\u7387\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e\u603b\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u4f73\u786c\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e\u4e3a1200-1400MHz\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u548c32-64KB\u5c0f\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u80fd\u8017\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e58\u79ef\u3002\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u9891\u7387\u4ec5\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u5141\u8bb8\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6709\u6548\u3002\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7684LLM\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Given a learned operator $\\widehat{A}$ and a full-rank constraint matrix $C$ encoding one or more invariants, we show that the matrix closest to $\\widehat{A}$ in the Frobenius norm and satisfying $C^\\top A = 0$ is the orthogonal projection $A^\\star = \\widehat{A} - C(C^\\top C)^{-1}C^\\top \\widehat{A}$. This correction is uniquely defined, low rank and fully determined by the violation $C^\\top \\widehat{A}$. In the single-invariant case it reduces to a rank-one update. We prove that $A^\\star$ enforces exact conservation while minimally perturbing the dynamics, and we verify these properties numerically on a Markov-type example. The projection provides an elementary and general mechanism for embedding exact invariants into any learned linear model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u7ebf\u6027\u5b88\u6052\u5f8b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u4fee\u6b63\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b88\u6052\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b88\u6052\u5f8b\uff08\u5982\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\uff09\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4fee\u6b63\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u7cbe\u786e\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b88\u6052\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed9\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7b97\u5b50 $\\widehat{A}$ \u548c\u8868\u793a\u5b88\u6052\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6ee1\u79e9\u77e9\u9635 $C$\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71 $A^\\star = \\widehat{A} - C(C^\\top C)^{-1}C^\\top \\widehat{A}$ \u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6295\u5f71\u662f\u6ee1\u8db3 $C^\\top A = 0$ \u4e14\u4e0e $\\widehat{A}$ \u5728Frobenius\u8303\u6570\u4e0b\u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u5728\u5355\u5b88\u6052\u5f8b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u79e9\u4e00\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e $A^\\star$ \u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5b88\u6052\u5f8b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u3002\u5728\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u578b\u793a\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u6295\u5f71\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u901a\u7528\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u7cbe\u786e\u5b88\u6052\u5f8b\u5d4c\u5165\u4efb\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5b88\u6052\u5f8b\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u7cbe\u786e\u5b88\u6052\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}
