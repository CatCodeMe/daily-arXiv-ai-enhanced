### [1] [Experiments \& Analysis of Privacy-Preserving SQL Query Sanitization Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13528)
*Loïs Ecoffet,Veronika Rehn-Sonigo,Jean-François Couchot,Catuscia Palamidessi*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文系统分类和定量分析了SQL查询净化系统，评估其在数据效用、查询执行开销和隐私保证之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析性SQL查询在提取数据库洞察的同时带来显著的隐私风险，现有的查询净化系统设计复杂多样，需要系统化的分类和性能评估。

Method: 基于隐私模型、保护单元和软件架构等定性标准对SQL净化系统进行分类，并对主要系统进行定量分析，测量数据效用、查询执行开销和隐私保证之间的权衡。

Result: 提供了当前隐私保护数据库技术的结构化概览和性能评估，阐明了各种系统的能力和局限性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为研究人员和实践者提供了清晰的指导，帮助他们理解现有SQL查询净化系统的特性和性能表现。

Abstract: Analytical SQL queries are essential for extracting insights from relational
databases but concurrently introduce significant privacy risks by potentially
exposing sensitive information. To mitigate these risks, numerous query
sanitization systems have been developed, employing diverse approaches that
create a complex landscape for both researchers and practitioners. These
systems vary fundamentally in their design, including the underlying privacy
model, such as k-anonymity or Differential Privacy; the protected privacy unit,
whether at the tuple- or user-level; and the software architecture, which can
be proxy-based or integrated. This paper provides a systematic classification
of state-of-the-art SQL sanitization systems based on these qualitative
criteria and the scope of queries they support. Furthermore, we present a
quantitative analysis of leading systems, empirically measuring the trade-offs
between data utility, query execution overhead, and privacy guarantees across a
range of analytical queries. This work offers a structured overview and
performance assessment intended to clarify the capabilities and limitations of
current privacy-preserving database technologies.

### [2] [The Past Still Matters: A Temporally-Valid Data Discovery System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13662)
*Mahdi Esmailoghli,Matthias Weidlich*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了时间有效数据发现的概念，强调现有数据发现方法忽略了数据相关性的时间变化维度，特别是在缺少明确时间元数据的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据发现研究在索引结构、相似性度量和查询基础设施方面取得了显著进展，但忽略了相关性是随时间变化的这一关键维度。

Method: 提出了包含时间维度的数据发现系统架构，包括版本发现、时间谱系推断、变更日志合成和时间感知数据发现等技术。

Result: 为新一代数据发现系统奠定了基础，将改变我们与演化数据湖的交互方式。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够处理时间变化相关性的新类别数据发现系统，以更好地支持用户任务。

Abstract: Over the past decade, the proliferation of public and enterprise data lakes
has fueled intensive research into data discovery, aiming to identify the most
relevant data from vast and complex corpora to support diverse user tasks.
Significant progress has been made through the development of innovative index
structures, similarity measures, and querying infrastructures. Despite these
advances, a critical aspect remains overlooked: relevance is time-varying.
Existing discovery methods largely ignore this temporal dimension, especially
when explicit date/time metadata is missing. To fill this gap, we outline a
vision for a data discovery system that incorporates the temporal dimension of
data. Specifically, we define the problem of temporally-valid data discovery
and argue that addressing it requires techniques for version discovery,
temporal lineage inference, change log synthesis, and time-aware data
discovery. We then present a system architecture to deliver these techniques,
before we summarize research challenges and opportunities. As such, we lay the
foundation for a new class of data discovery systems, transforming how we
interact with evolving data lakes.

### [3] [Distributed Reductions for the Maximum Weight Independent Set Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13306)
*Jannick Borowitz,Ernestine Großmann,Mattthias Schimek*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个分布式内存并行缩减算法用于求解最大权重独立集问题，实现了在大规模图上的高效处理，相比现有方法获得了显著的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最大权重独立集是一个重要的NP难优化问题，现有方法主要使用数据缩减规则来处理中小规模图，但缺乏针对超大规模图的分布式并行解决方案。

Method: 提出了分布式内存并行缩减算法、分布式reduce-and-greedy和reduce-and-peel启发式算法，支持异步处理模式。

Result: 在1024个处理器上实验显示良好的可扩展性，reduce-and-peel方法相比顺序方法平均加速33倍，reduce-and-greedy方法平均加速50倍，能处理超过10亿顶点和170亿边的图。

Conclusion: 分布式并行方法能够有效处理超大规模图的最大权重独立集问题，在保持解质量的同时获得显著性能提升。

Abstract: Finding maximum-weight independent sets in graphs is an important NP-hard
optimization problem. Given a vertex-weighted graph $G$, the task is to find a
subset of pairwise non-adjacent vertices of $G$ with maximum weight. Most
recently published practical exact algorithms and heuristics for this problem
use a variety of data-reduction rules to compute (near-)optimal solutions.
Applying these rules results in an equivalent instance of reduced size. An
optimal solution to the reduced instance can be easily used to construct an
optimal solution for the original input.
  In this work, we present the first distributed-memory parallel reduction
algorithms for this problem, targeting graphs beyond the scale of previous
sequential approaches. Furthermore, we propose the first distributed
reduce-and-greedy and reduce-and-peel algorithms for finding a maximum weight
independent set heuristically.
  In our practical evaluation, our experiments on up to $1024$ processors
demonstrate good scalability of our distributed reduce algorithms while
maintaining good reduction impact. Our asynchronous reduce-and-peel approach
achieves an average speedup of $33\times$ over a sequential state-of-the-art
reduce-and-peel approach on 36 real-world graphs with a solution quality close
to the sequential algorithm. Our reduce-and-greedy algorithms even achieve
average speedups of up to $50\times$ at the cost of a lower solution quality.
Moreover, our distributed approach allows us to consider graphs with more than
one billion vertices and 17 billion edges.

### [4] [Dodoor: Efficient Randomized Decentralized Scheduling with Load Caching for Heterogeneous Tasks and Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12889)
*Wei Da,Evangelia Kalyvianaki*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Dodoor是一种高效的随机化去中心化调度器，通过批量更新缓存服务器信息减少通信开销，使用新颖的负载评分在多维资源需求的异构集群中实现任务调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数据中心需要高效的分布式任务调度系统，传统去中心化调度器依赖实时探测远程服务器，导致通信开销大。Dodoor旨在通过缓存信息和批量更新来减少通信成本。

Method: 基于加权球-箱模型的b-批量设置，使用缓存服务器信息而非实时探测，提出新颖的负载评分来捕捉服务器与任务之间的反亲和性，替代传统的待处理任务计数方法。

Result: 在101节点异构集群上测试，相比传统方法：调度消息减少55-66%，吞吐量提升最高33.2%和21.5%，平均完成时间减少12.1%和7.2%，尾部延迟改善21.9%和24.6%。

Conclusion: Dodoor通过批量更新缓存信息和创新的负载评分机制，在减少通信开销的同时显著提升了调度性能，适用于现代数据中心的多维资源调度需求。

Abstract: This paper introduces Dodoor, an efficient randomized decentralized scheduler
designed for task scheduling in modern data centers. Dodoor leverages advanced
research on the weighted balls-into-bins model with b-batched setting. Unlike
other decentralized schedulers that rely on real-time probing of remote
servers, Dodoor makes scheduling decisions based on cached server information,
which is updated in batches, to reduce communication overheads. To schedule
tasks with dynamic, multidimensional resource requirements in heterogeneous
cluster, Dodoor uses a novel load score to measure servers' loads for each
scheduled task. This score captures the anti-affinity between servers and tasks
in contrast to the commonly used heuristic of counting pending tasks to balance
load. On a 101-node heterogeneous cluster, Dodoor is evaluated using two
workloads: (i) simulated Azure virtual machines placements and (ii) real
serverless Python functions executions in Docker. The evaluation shows that
Dodoor reduces scheduling messages by 55--66% on both workloads. Dodoor can
also increase throughput by up to 33.2% and 21.5%, reduce mean makespan latency
by 12.1% and 7.2%, and improve tail latency by 21.9% and 24.6% across the two
workloads.

to improve Performance and speed in responding to users. Finally by using FDIRS
framework we succeeded to increase Efficiency, Performance and reliability of
integrated systems and remove some of previous frameworks problems.

### [6] [BanaServe: Unified KV Cache and Dynamic Module Migration for Balancing Disaggregated LLM Serving in AI Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13223)
*Yiyuan He,Minxian Xu,Jingfeng Wu,Jianmin Hu,Chong Ma,Min Shen,Le Chen,Chengzhong Xu,Lin Qu,Kejiang Ye*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: BanaServe是一个动态编排框架，通过层级权重迁移、注意力级KV缓存迁移和全局KV缓存存储共享，解决解耦LLM服务中的资源分配不平衡和缓存热点问题，显著提升吞吐量和降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解耦LLM服务系统面临三个关键问题：静态资源分配无法适应动态工作负载导致资源浪费或SLO违规；预填充和解码阶段固有的负载不平衡导致资源利用率低；前缀缓存感知路由导致负载分布不均。

Method: 引入层级权重迁移、注意力级KV缓存迁移和全局KV缓存存储共享，支持粗粒度（层级）和细粒度（注意力级）负载重分配，最小化延迟开销，使路由器能够进行纯负载感知调度。

Result: 相比vLLM，BanaServe实现1.2x-3.9x更高的吞吐量，总处理时间降低3.9%-78.4%；相比DistServe，吞吐量提升1.1x-2.8x，延迟降低1.4%-70.1%。

Conclusion: BanaServe通过动态资源重平衡和消除缓存热点，有效解决了现有解耦LLM服务系统的局限性，显著提升了系统效率和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in AI infrastructure,
driving the need for high throughput, resource efficient serving systems.
Disaggregated LLM serving, which separates prompt prefill from auto-regressive
decode, has emerged as a promising architecture by isolating their
heterogeneous compute and memory demands. However, current disaggregated
systems face three key limitations: (i) static resource allocation cannot adapt
to highly dynamic workloads, causing over-provisioning that wastes resources or
under-provisioning that violates service level objectives (SLOs); (ii) inherent
load imbalance between prefill and decode stages, where prefill is
compute-bound and decode is memory-bound, causes under-utilization in one tier
while the other becomes a bottleneck; and (iii) prefix cache aware routing
skews load distribution, as high cache hit rate prefill nodes attract
disproportionately more requests, further degrading balance and efficiency. To
address these issues, we present BanaServe, a dynamic orchestration framework
that continuously rebalances computational and memory resources across prefill
and decode instances while eliminating hotspots induced by cache. BanaServe
introduces layer level weight migration, attention level Key Value Cache (KV
Cache) migration, and Global KV Cache Store sharing with layer wise overlapped
transmission, enabling both coarse grained (layer level) and fine grained
(attention level) load redistribution with minimal latency overhead. These
mechanisms allow routers to perform purely load aware scheduling, unconstrained
by cache placement. Compared to vLLM, BanaServe achieves 1.2x-3.9x higher
throughput with 3.9%-78.4% lower total processing time, and outperforms
DistServe by 1.1x-2.8x in throughput with 1.4%-70.1% latency reduction.

### [7] [Service-Level Energy Modeling and Experimentation for Cloud-Native Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13447)
*Julian Legler,Sebastian Werner,Maria C. Borges,Stefan Tai*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个服务级能耗模型，专门针对微服务架构中跨容器服务交互（特别是网络和存储组件）的能耗影响，解决了现有方法忽略辅助服务能耗的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务架构虽然提供了灵活性和可扩展性，但也导致云资源需求增加和能耗上升。现有研究主要关注容器级别的CPU和内存能耗，或系统级评估，但忽略了跨容器服务交互（特别是网络和存储）的能耗影响。

Method: 开发了一个服务级能耗模型，捕捉微服务在容器间分布式执行的特性，并配套实验工具，同时考虑CPU、内存、网络和存储组件的能耗。通过多种实验配置对流行的开源云原生微服务应用进行验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，忽略网络和存储组件会导致辅助服务能耗低估高达63%，突显了在能效微服务架构设计中需要进行更全面能耗评估的必要性。

Conclusion: 网络和存储组件在微服务能耗中扮演重要角色，忽略它们会导致显著低估辅助服务的能耗。需要更全面的能耗评估方法来设计能效优化的微服务架构。

Abstract: Microservice architectures have become the dominant paradigm for cloud-native
systems, offering flexibility and scalability. However, this shift has also led
to increased demand for cloud resources, contributing to higher energy
consumption and carbon emissions. While existing research has focused on
measuring fine-grained energy usage of CPU and memory at the container level,
or on system-wide assessments, these approaches often overlook the energy
impact of cross-container service interactions, especially those involving
network and storage for auxiliary services such as observability and system
monitoring. To address this gap, we introduce a service-level energy model that
captures the distributed nature of microservice execution across containers.
Our model is supported by an experimentation tool that accounts for energy
consumption not just in CPU and memory, but also in network and storage
components. We validate our approach through extensive experimentation with
diverse experiment configurations of auxiliary services for a popular
open-source cloud-native microservice application. Results show that omitting
network and storage can lead to an underestimation of auxiliary service energy
use by up to 63%, highlighting the need for more comprehensive energy
assessments in the design of energy-efficient microservice architectures.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ARES是一个基于长度预测的自适应解码重调度系统，通过LLM原生预测方法准确预测剩余生成长度，在解码阶段实现动态负载均衡，显著提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中输出长度的变化导致解码阶段严重的负载不平衡，特别是在长输出推理任务中。现有系统使用静态的预填充到解码调度，经常导致SLO违规和OOM故障。

Method: 提出轻量级连续的LLM原生预测方法，利用LLM隐藏状态建模剩余生成长度；在解码阶段采用重调度解决方案，集成当前和预测工作负载的动态平衡机制。

Result: 预测精度显著提升（MAE降低49.42%），开销大幅减少（预测器参数减少93.28%）；P99 TPOT降低74.77%，吞吐量提升高达2.24倍。

Conclusion: ARES系统通过长度预测和自适应重调度，有效解决了LLM推理中的负载不平衡问题，显著提升了系统性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference has emerged as a fundamental paradigm.
In real-world scenarios, variations in output length cause severe workload
imbalance in the decode phase, particularly for long-output reasoning tasks.
Existing systems, such as PD disaggregation architectures, rely on static
prefill-to-decode scheduling, which often results in SLO violations and OOM
failures under evolving decode workloads.
  In this paper, we propose ARES, an adaptive decoding rescheduling system
powered by length prediction to anticipate future workloads. Our core
contributions include: (1) A lightweight and continuous LLM-native prediction
method that leverages LLM hidden state to model remaining generation length
with high precision (reducing MAE by 49.42%) and low overhead (cutting
predictor parameters by 93.28%); (2) A rescheduling solution in decode phase
with : A dynamic balancing mechanism that integrates current and predicted
workloads, reducing P99 TPOT by 74.77% and achieving up to 2.24 times higher
goodput.

Method: 利用Globus Auth和Globus Compute，通过OpenAI兼容API在私有安全环境中运行并行推理工作负载，支持多种推理后端（如vLLM），自动扩展资源并维护"热"节点以实现低延迟执行。

Result: 实现了在现有HPC基础设施上提供云式AI模型访问，支持联邦集群间的请求分发，提供高吞吐量批处理和交互式两种模式。

Conclusion: FIRST框架成功满足了科学计算中对私有、安全、可扩展AI推理的需求，使研究人员能够在本地环境中高效运行大规模AI推理任务。

Abstract: We present the Federated Inference Resource Scheduling Toolkit (FIRST), a
framework enabling Inference-as-a-Service across distributed High-Performance
Computing (HPC) clusters. FIRST provides cloud-like access to diverse AI
models, like Large Language Models (LLMs), on existing HPC infrastructure.
Leveraging Globus Auth and Globus Compute, the system allows researchers to run
parallel inference workloads via an OpenAI-compliant API on private, secure
environments. This cluster-agnostic API allows requests to be distributed
across federated clusters, targeting numerous hosted models. FIRST supports
multiple inference backends (e.g., vLLM), auto-scales resources, maintains
"hot" nodes for low-latency execution, and offers both high-throughput batch
and interactive modes. The framework addresses the growing demand for private,
secure, and scalable AI inference in scientific workflows, allowing researchers
to generate billions of tokens daily on-premises without relying on commercial
cloud infrastructure.

### [10] [Tight Conditions for Binary-Output Tasks under Crashes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13755)
*Timothé Albouy,Antonio Fernández Anta,Chryssis Georgiou,Nicolas Nicolaou,Junlang Wang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 该论文完全刻画了在同步和异步分布式系统中，解决具有二进制输出任务所需的必要和充分系统条件，重点关注输出值集合而非有效性和值多重性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索分布式系统中解决二进制输出任务的系统条件，统一多个分布式计算问题如二进制共识和对称性破缺，并产生适用于更强任务表述的不可能性证明。

Method: 采用输出集合方法，关注任务可能产生的不同输出值集合，考虑部分进程可能不输出值的情况，分析n个进程中最多t个可能崩溃的系统条件。

Result: 为同步和异步系统提供了二进制输出任务可解性的完整特征化条件，这些条件在n和t上是紧致的。

Conclusion: 输出集合方法产生了高度一般化的结果，能够统一多个分布式计算问题，并为包含有效性、值多重性或超越二进制输出的更强任务表述提供不可能性证明。

Abstract: This paper explores necessary and sufficient system conditions to solve
distributed tasks with binary outputs (\textit{i.e.}, tasks with output values
in $\{0,1\}$). We focus on the distinct output sets of values a task can
produce (intentionally disregarding validity and value multiplicity),
considering that some processes may output no value. In a distributed system
with $n$ processes, of which up to $t \leq n$ can crash, we provide a complete
characterization of the tight conditions on $n$ and $t$ under which every class
of tasks with binary outputs is solvable, for both synchronous and asynchronous
systems. This output-set approach yields highly general results: it unifies
multiple distributed computing problems, such as binary consensus and symmetry
breaking, and it produces impossibility proofs that hold for stronger task
formulations, including those that consider validity, account for value
multiplicity, or move beyond binary outputs.

### [11] [A faster algorithm for efficient longest common substring calculation for non-parametric entropy estimation in sequential data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13330)
*Bridget Smart,Max Ward,Matthew Roughan*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出LCSFinder算法，将最长公共子串计算的最坏情况性能从立方时间提升到对数线性时间，显著提高序列数据熵估计的效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于最长公共子串的非参数熵估计是信号处理中的基本工具，但现有方法效率低下，限制了在真实世界数据中的应用

Method: 使用排序后缀数组和持久化二叉搜索树等标准算法构造，通过精心设计的细节实现在动态增长序列上匹配所需的熵估计

Result: 在真实和模拟数据上相比现有实现获得显著加速，使熵估计在以前不可行的规模上变得实用

Conclusion: LCSFinder算法使大规模序列数据的熵估计变得可行，为信号处理应用提供了更高效的工具

Abstract: Non-parametric entropy estimation on sequential data is a fundamental tool in
signal processing, capturing information flow within or between processes to
measure predictability, redundancy, or similarity. Methods based on longest
common substrings (LCS) provide a non-parametric estimate of typical set size
but are often inefficient, limiting use on real-world data. We introduce
LCSFinder, a new algorithm that improves the worst-case performance of LCS
calculations from cubic to log-linear time. Although built on standard
algorithmic constructs - including sorted suffix arrays and persistent binary
search trees - the details require care to provide the matches required for
entropy estimation on dynamically growing sequences. We demonstrate that
LCSFinder achieves dramatic speedups over existing implementations on real and
simulated data, enabling entropy estimation at scales previously infeasible in
practical signal processing.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文解决了2层交叉最小化问题的十年开放性问题，给出了首个次指数参数化算法，并研究了多层情况下的算法复杂度和多项式核化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多层交叉最小化问题的参数化复杂度，特别是解决2层交叉最小化问题的十年开放性问题，并探索多层情况下的计算复杂性边界。

Method: 设计了首个2层交叉最小化问题的次指数固定参数算法，运行时间为2^O(√k log k) + n·k^O(1)；对于3层情况给出了运行时间为2^O(k^{2/3} log k) + n·k^O(1)的算法；并研究了多项式核化的可能性。

Result: 成功解决了2层交叉最小化问题的开放性问题，给出了次指数算法；对于3层情况也给出了次指数算法；但对于h≥5层，证明了在ETH假设下不存在运行时间为2^o(k/log k)·n^O(1)的算法；在核化方面，为h=2和h=3设计了多项式核，但排除了h≥4时多项式核的存在性。

Conclusion: 多层交叉最小化问题在参数化复杂度方面存在明显的层次结构：2层和3层允许次指数算法和多项式核，但4层及以上既不允许多项式核，5层及以上在ETH下不允许次指数算法，这揭示了该问题复杂性的精确边界。

Abstract: The starting point of our work is a decade-old open question concerning the
subexponential parameterized complexity of \textsc{2-Layer Crossing
Minimization}. In this problem, the input is an $n$-vertex graph $G$ whose
vertices are partitioned into two independent sets $V_1$ and $V_2$, and a
non-negative integer $k$. The question is whether $G$ admits a 2-layered
drawing with at most $k$ crossings, where each $V_i$ lies on a distinct line
parallel to the $x$-axis, and all edges are straight lines. We resolve this
open question by giving the first subexponential fixed-parameter algorithm for
this problem, running in time $2^{O(\sqrt{k}\log k)} + n \cdot k^{O(1)}$.
  We then ask whether the subexponential phenomenon extends beyond two layers.
In the general $h$-Layer Crossing Minimization problem, the vertex set is
partitioned into $h$ independent sets $V_1, \ldots, V_h$, and the goal is to
decide whether an $h$-layered drawing with at most $k$ crossings exists. We
present a subexponential FPT algorithm for three layers with running time
$2^{O(k^{2/3}\log k)} + n \cdot k^{O(1)}$ for $h = 3$ layers. In contrast, we
show that for all $h \ge 5$, no algorithm with running time $2^{o(k/\log k)}
\cdot n^{O(1)}$ exists unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails.
  Finally, we address polynomial kernelization. While a polynomial kernel was
already known for $h=2$, we design a new polynomial kernel for $h=3$. These
kernels are essential ingredients in our subexponential algorithms. Finally, we
rule out polynomial kernels for all $h \ge 4$ unless the polynomial hierarchy
collapses.

been a line of work on improving the approximation ratio for this problem in
recent years. A key algorithmic component in these works is the cluster LP.
Chromatic Correlation Clustering is an interesting generalization that has also

used in Chromatic Correlation Clustering. We answer this question with
affirmatives by presenting a $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for
Chromatic Correlation Clustering using a chromatic cluster LP.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AutoCode是一个使用多轮验证生成竞赛级编程问题陈述和测试用例的系统，在保留问题上测试套件与官方判断的一致性接近99%，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编写竞争性编程问题需要精确设置约束、输入分布和边界情况，排除捷径，针对特定算法，并校准超出大多数参赛者能力的复杂度，这使其成为测试大型语言模型通用能力的理想场景。

Method: AutoCode使用多轮验证生成问题陈述和测试用例，从随机种子问题创建新颖变体，并通过交叉验证生成解决方案与测试用例来过滤不良问题。

Result: 在保留问题上，AutoCode测试套件与官方判断的一致性达到99%，显著优于HardTests的81%。系统成功生成了被Grandmaster级程序员评为竞赛质量的新问题。

Conclusion: AutoCode能够可靠地生成高质量的竞争性编程问题，通过人类专家验证确保高正确性，证明了大型语言模型在复杂问题生成任务中的能力。

Abstract: Writing competitive programming problems is exacting. Authors must: set
constraints, input distributions, and edge cases that rule out shortcuts;
target specific algorithms (e.g., max-flow, dynamic programming, data
structures); and calibrate complexity beyond the reach of most competitors. We
argue that this makes for an ideal test of general large language model
capabilities and study whether they can do this reliably. We introduce
AutoCode, which uses multiple rounds of validation to yield competition-grade
problem statements and test cases. On held-out problems, AutoCode test suites
approach 99% consistency with official judgments, a significant improvement
over current state-of-the-art methods like HardTests, which achieve less than
81%. Furthermore, starting with a random seed problem, AutoCode can create
novel variants with reference and brute-force solutions. By cross-verifying
these generated solutions against test cases, we can further filter out
malformed problems. Our system ensures high correctness, as verified by human
experts. AutoCode successfully produces novel problems judged by
Grandmaster-level (top 0.3%) competitive programmers to be of contest quality.

*Minh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文证明在大型代码库中，使用关键词搜索足以检索相关且有用的代码上下文，无需大量GPU资源，可作为轻量级应用中的检索增强生成框架替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成框架通常使用语义搜索，需要大量计算资源进行训练和托管嵌入模型，难以集成到轻量级应用（如IDE中的AI代码补全）中。

Method: 使用关键词搜索方法替代语义搜索来检索相关代码上下文，避免了计算密集的嵌入模型需求。

Result: 在Code Context Competition基准测试中，Kotlin和Python赛道的chRF分数分别达到0.748和0.725，表明检索到的代码上下文具有实用性。

Conclusion: 关键词搜索是检索相关代码上下文的有效方法，能够在资源受限的环境中替代语义搜索，为轻量级应用提供可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks aim to enhance Code Language
Models (CLMs) by including another module for retrieving relevant context to
construct the input prompt. However, these retrieval modules commonly use
semantic search, requiring substantial computational resources for training and
hosting these embedded models, making them infeasible to integrate into
lightweight applications such as in-IDE AI-based code completion. In this
solution paper, we prove that using keyword-search is sufficient to retrieve
relevant and useful code context inside large codebases, without the need for
extensive GPU resources. The usefulness of code contexts found by our solution
is demonstrated through their completion results on the Code Context
Competition's benchmark, reaching 0.748 and 0.725 chRF scores on Kotlin and
Python tracks, respectively.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ADPerf工具，用于生成真实的点云数据测试用例，以暴露自动驾驶系统中障碍物检测模块的延迟问题，并评估这些延迟对其他模块的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中的障碍物检测延迟对安全性至关重要，但目前对障碍物检测模块的延迟及其对点云数据变化的弹性理解不足。

Method: 对Apollo和Autoware两个工业级自动驾驶系统进行综合调查，基于调查结果开发ADPerf工具，生成能暴露检测延迟增加的现实点云数据测试用例。

Result: ADPerf成功对广泛使用的3D障碍物检测模块进行压力测试，并评估了延迟对轨迹预测模块的传播影响，发现3D障碍物检测可能成为系统延迟的主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 需要对障碍物检测组件进行性能测试，特别是3D障碍物检测，因为它们可能成为自动驾驶系统延迟的主要瓶颈，这种不利影响还会传播到其他模块，降低系统整体可靠性。

Abstract: Obstacle detection is crucial to the operation of autonomous driving systems,
which rely on multiple sensors, such as cameras and LiDARs, combined with code
logic and deep learning models to detect obstacles for time-sensitive
decisions. Consequently, obstacle detection latency is critical to the safety
and effectiveness of autonomous driving systems. However, the latency of the
obstacle detection module and its resilience to various changes in the LiDAR
point cloud data are not yet fully understood. In this work, we present the
first comprehensive investigation on measuring and modeling the performance of
the obstacle detection modules in two industry-grade autonomous driving
systems, i.e., Apollo and Autoware. Learning from this investigation, we
introduce ADPerf, a tool that aims to generate realistic point cloud data test
cases that can expose increased detection latency. Increasing latency decreases
the availability of the detected obstacles and stresses the capabilities of
subsequent modules in autonomous driving systems, i.e., the modules may be
negatively impacted by the increased latency in obstacle detection.
  We applied ADPerf to stress-test the performance of widely used 3D obstacle
detection modules in autonomous driving systems, as well as the propagation of
such tests on trajectory prediction modules. Our evaluation highlights the need
to conduct performance testing of obstacle detection components, especially 3D
obstacle detection, as they can be a major bottleneck to increased latency of
the autonomous driving system. Such an adverse outcome will also further
propagate to other modules, reducing the overall reliability of autonomous
driving systems.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在NLP应用中的广泛使用，其可信度问题（特别是安全性和鲁棒性）日益突出，需要系统化的评估方法。

Method: 集成AutoDAN等已知扰动方法，采用多数投票机制，结合交互式用户界面提供直观的可信度指标可视化。

Result: 在Vicuna-7b、Llama2-7b和GPT-3.5等模型上的初步案例研究表明，该框架能有效识别安全性和鲁棒性漏洞。

Conclusion: TRUSTVIS不仅提供可靠的评估结果，还通过交互式界面让用户深入探索结果，支持有针对性的模型改进。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize Natural Language
Processing (NLP) applications, critical concerns about their trustworthiness
persist, particularly in safety and robustness. To address these challenges, we
introduce TRUSTVIS, an automated evaluation framework that provides a
comprehensive assessment of LLM trustworthiness. A key feature of our framework
is its interactive user interface, designed to offer intuitive visualizations
of trustworthiness metrics. By integrating well-known perturbation methods like
AutoDAN and employing majority voting across various evaluation methods,
TRUSTVIS not only provides reliable results but also makes complex evaluation
processes accessible to users. Preliminary case studies on models like
Vicuna-7b, Llama2-7b, and GPT-3.5 demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in identifying safety and robustness vulnerabilities, while the
interactive interface allows users to explore results in detail, empowering
targeted model improvements. Video Link: https://youtu.be/k1TrBqNVg8g

### [18] [Isolating Compiler Bugs through Compilation Steps Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13128)
*Yujie Liu,Mingxuan Zhu,Shengyu Cheng,Dan Hao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CompSCAN是一种新颖的编译器bug隔离技术，通过分析编译步骤序列来识别bug原因，在真实LLVM和GCC bug上表现出色，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编译器bug会传播到依赖软件中，确保编译器正确性至关重要。现有技术主要通过对编译输入进行变异来生成测试用例，但缺乏对内部步骤的因果分析，限制了其有效性。

Method: CompSCAN采用三阶段过程：(1)提取导致原始失败的编译步骤序列；(2)识别bug引发步骤并收集对应的编译器代码元素；(3)计算每个代码元素的可疑分数并输出可疑排名列表作为bug隔离结果。

Result: 在185个真实LLVM和GCC bug上评估，CompSCAN在Top-1/3/5/10排名中分别成功隔离了50、85、100和123个bug。相比ETEM和ODFL，CompSCAN在这些指标上分别实现了44.51%/50.18%/36.24%/24.49%和31.58%/49.12%/44.93%/21.78%的相对改进，且运行速度更快。

Conclusion: CompSCAN通过分析编译步骤序列有效隔离编译器bug，在效果和效率上都优于现有技术，为编译器bug定位提供了新思路。

Abstract: Compilers are essential to software systems, and their bugs can propagate to
dependent software. Ensuring compiler correctness is critical. However,
isolating compiler bugs remains challenging due to the internal complexity of
compiler execution. Existing techniques primarily mutate compilation inputs to
generate passing and failing tests, but often lack causal analysis of internal
steps, limiting their effectiveness.
  To address this limitation, we propose CompSCAN, a novel compiler bug
isolation technique that applies analysis over the sequence of compilation
steps. CompSCAN follows a three-stage process: (1) extracting the array of
compilation steps that leads to the original failure, (2) identifying
bug-causing steps and collecting corresponding compiler code elements, and (3)
calculating suspicious scores for each code element and outputting a suspicious
ranking list as the bug isolation result.
  We evaluate CompSCAN on 185 real-world LLVM and GCC bugs. Results show that
CompSCAN outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both effectiveness and
efficiency. CompSCAN successfully isolates 50, 85, 100, and 123 bugs within the
Top-1/3/5/10 ranks, respectively. Compared with ETEM and ODFL, two
state-of-the-art compiler bug isolation techniques, CompSCAN achieves relative
improvements of 44.51% / 50.18% / 36.24% / 24.49% over ETEM, and 31.58% /
49.12% / 44.93% / 21.78% over ODFL on those metrics. Moreover, CompSCAN runs
faster on average per bug than both baselines.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GRACE是一个编译器自动调优框架，通过利用pass协同作用和对比学习来减少搜索空间，为LLVM IR指令数优化提供高效解决方案，在保持低调优时间的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编译器启发式方法通用但效果欠佳，迭代编译搜索成本过高，机器学习方法泛化能力不足，需要一种既能高效搜索又能良好泛化的编译器自动调优方法。

Method: 利用pass协同作用和加权评分生成高质量候选序列和pass池，使用对比学习和数据增强创建程序嵌入进行相似性聚类，在聚类内进行进化搜索得到核心序列集，测试时选择最佳序列并用轻量技术优化。

Result: 在7个数据集上，GRACE相比opt -Oz平均减少LLVM IR指令数10.09%(LLVM 10.0.0)和10.19%(LLVM 18.1.6)，平均调优时间小于1秒/程序。

Conclusion: GRACE在编译器自动调优方面达到了最先进性能，兼具高效性和实用性，为编译器优化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Compiler pass selection and phase ordering present a significant challenge in
achieving optimal program performance, particularly for objectives like code
size reduction. Standard compiler heuristics offer general applicability but
often yield suboptimal, program-specific results due to their one-size-fits-all
nature. While iterative compilation can find tailored solutions, its
prohibitive search cost limits practical use. Machine learning approaches
promise faster inference but frequently struggle with generalization to unseen
programs. This paper introduces GRACE, a novel framework for compiler
auto-tuning, demonstrated for LLVM IR instruction count optimization. GRACE
effectively curtails the search space by leveraging pass synergies and a
weighted scoring method to generate initial high-quality candidate sequences
and a pass pool. It then employs contrastive learning, using pass
sequence-based data augmentation, to create program embeddings that facilitate
similarity-aware clustering. Evolutionary search within these clusters yields a
coreset of $k$ specialized pass sequences designed for robust generalization to
unseen programs. At test time, GRACE efficiently selects the best coreset
sequence and refines it using lightweight techniques. Experimental results on
seven diverse datasets show that GRACE reduces LLVM IR instruction count by an
average of 10.09% on LLVM 10.0.0 and 10.19% on LLVM 18.1.6 compared to opt -Oz,
while incurring an average tuning time of less than 1s per program,
demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance and practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出了一个专为LLVM新Pass管理器设计的编译器自动调优框架，使用形式化语法定义有效嵌套流水线空间，通过基于森林的数据结构和结构感知遗传算法确保生成有效的优化流水线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编译器自动调优方法假设线性pass序列，与LLVM新Pass管理器的分层设计不匹配，无法保证生成语法有效的优化流水线。

Method: 引入形式化语法定义有效嵌套流水线空间，使用基于森林的数据结构表示，开发结构感知遗传算法直接操作这些森林，确保所有候选解在构造时就是有效的。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上评估，使用LLVM 18.1.6，发现的流水线相比标准opt -Oz优化级别平均获得13.62%的额外指令数减少。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在这个复杂、受约束的搜索空间中导航，识别出有效且高效的pass流水线。

Abstract: Compiler optimization relies on sequences of passes to improve program
performance. Selecting and ordering these passes automatically, known as
compiler auto-tuning, is challenging due to the large and complex search space.
Existing approaches generally assume a linear sequence of passes, a model
compatible with legacy compilers but fundamentally misaligned with the
hierarchical design of the LLVM New Pass Manager. This misalignment prevents
them from guaranteeing the generation of syntactically valid optimization
pipelines. In this work, we present a new auto-tuning framework built from the
ground up for the New Pass Manager. We introduce a formal grammar to define the
space of valid nested pipelines and a forest-based data structure for their
native representation. Upon this foundation, we develop a structure-aware
Genetic Algorithm whose operators manipulate these forests directly, ensuring
that all candidate solutions are valid by construction. The framework first
mines synergistic pass relationships to guide the search. An optional
refinement stage further explores subtle performance variations arising from
different valid structural arrangements.
  We evaluate our approach on seven benchmark datasets using LLVM 18.1.6. The
discovered pipelines achieve an average of 13.62% additional instruction count
reduction compared to the standard opt -Oz optimization level, showing that our
framework is capable of navigating this complex, constrained search space to
identify valid and effective pass pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学计算中的正确性验证在形式化方法和编程语言社区中日益受到关注，但现有验证技术难以应对实际科学计算应用的复杂性，主要原因是两个社区之间缺乏对机器可验证正确性挑战的共同理解。

Method: 提出为科学计算正确性开发专门的挑战问题，这些挑战旨在补充形式化方法和编程语言研究者研究的一般程序问题，以确保满足科学计算应用的需求。

Result: 提出了与科学计算相关的几个正确性维度，并讨论了设计评估科学计算正确性的挑战问题的指导原则和标准。

Conclusion: 通过开发专门的挑战问题，可以更好地指导形式化方法和编程语言验证技术的发展，以满足科学计算应用的正确性需求。

Abstract: Correctness in scientific computing (SC) is gaining increasing attention in
the formal methods (FM) and programming languages (PL) community. Existing
PL/FM verification techniques struggle with the complexities of realistic SC
applications. Part of the problem is a lack of a common understanding between
the SC and PL/FM communities of machine-verifiable correctness challenges and
dimensions of correctness in SC applications.
  To address this gap, we call for specialized challenge problems to inform the
development and evaluation of FM/PL verification techniques for correctness in
SC. These specialized challenges are intended to augment existing problems
studied by FM/PL researchers for general programs to ensure the needs of SC
applications can be met. We propose several dimensions of correctness relevant
to scientific computing, and discuss some guidelines and criteria for designing
challenge problems to evaluate correctness in scientific computing.

multi-domain problems. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that
OpenDerisk significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
accuracy and efficiency. This effectiveness is validated by its large-scale
production deployment at Ant Group, where it serves over 3,000 daily users
across diverse scenarios, confirming its industrial-grade scalability and

Method: 采用基于大型语言模型的自动修复方法，收集了产品源代码的40000多个提交，评估了四个最先进LLM增强的工业CI系统性能，并与人工修正进行比较。

Result: 配备LLM的CI系统可以解决基线数据集中63%的编译错误，在成功CI构建的修复中，83%被认为是合理的。LLM显著减少了调试时间，大多数成功案例在8分钟内完成。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在自动修复编译错误方面表现出色，能有效解决工业嵌入式系统中的持续集成问题，显著提高开发效率。

Abstract: The co-development of hardware and software in industrial embedded systems
frequently leads to compilation errors during continuous integration (CI).
Automated repair of such failures is promising, but existing techniques rely on
test cases, which are not available for non-compilable code.
  We employ an automated repair approach for compilation errors driven by large
language models (LLMs). Our study encompasses the collection of more than 40000
commits from the product's source code. We assess the performance of an
industrial CI system enhanced by four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing their
outcomes with manual corrections provided by human programmers. LLM-equipped CI
systems can resolve up to 63 % of the compilation errors in our baseline
dataset. Among the fixes associated with successful CI builds, 83 % are deemed
reasonable. Moreover, LLMs significantly reduce debugging time, with the
majority of successful cases completed within 8 minutes, compared to hours
typically required for manual debugging.

Result: 论文通过示例清楚地说明了物理学如何自然地适用于属性测试的规范，但哪些测试最可行和有用仍需进一步研究。

Conclusion: 将GFD理论表达为属性测试为解决海洋模型正确性验证的oracle问题提供了有前景的方法，但具体测试的可行性和实用性需要进一步探索。

Abstract: I take inspiration from the property-testing literature, particularly the
work of Prof. John Hughes, and explore how such ideas might be applied to
numerical models of the ocean. Specifically, I ask whether geophysical fluid
dynamics (GFD) theory, expressed as property tests, might be used to address
the oracle problem of testing the correctness of ocean models. I propose that a
number of simple idealized GFD problems can be framed as property tests. These
examples clearly illustrate how physics naturally lends itself to specifying
property tests. Which of these proposed tests might be most feasible and
useful, remains to be seen.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索仓库级预训练中不同处理策略对代码模型上下文学习能力的影响，旨在提高代码生成的准确性和上下文感知能力。

Method: 将OpenCoder模型的上下文窗口从4,096扩展到16,384个token，在10亿个精心筛选的仓库级数据上训练，并比较不同仓库处理技术。

Result: 尽管使用较小数据集，模型在Long Code Arena基准测试中表现与使用更大数据集的竞争模型相当；不同仓库处理技术效果相似，主要性能提升来自适应新的RoPE缩放参数。

Conclusion: 简单的文件级训练方法在原始序列长度下仍然非常有效，这为数据量和计算资源受限环境下的仓库级代码补全研究开辟了可能性。

Abstract: Repository-level pretraining is commonly used to enable large language models
for code to leverage codebase-wide context. This enhances their ability to
generate accurate and context-aware code completions. In this work, we
investigate how different repository-processing strategies affect in-context
learning in OpenCoder, a 1.5B-parameter model. We extend its context window
from 4,096 to 16,384 tokens by training on additional 1B tokens of curated
repository-level data. Despite relying on a smaller dataset than competing
models (which often use hundreds of billions of tokens), our model achieves
comparable performance on the Long Code Arena benchmark. We find that various
repository-processing techniques yield similarly strong results, with the
primary gain coming from adapting to a new rotary positional embedding (RoPE)
scaling parameter. Finally, we show that a simpler file-level training approach
at the original sequence length remains highly effective, opening up
repository-level code completion research to settings with more constrained
data and compute resources.

vendor-neutral deployment of 5G networks by disaggregating base station
components and supporting third-party xApps for near real-time RAN control.
However, the concurrent operation of multiple xApps can lead to conflicting
control actions, which may cause network performance degradation. In this work,
we propose a framework for xApp conflict management that combines explainable
machine learning and causal inference to evaluate the causal relationships
between RAN Control Parameters (RCPs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). We
use model explainability tools such as SHAP to identify RCPs that jointly
affect the same KPI, signaling potential conflicts, and represent these
interactions as a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). We then estimate the
causal impact of each of these RCPs on their associated KPIs using metrics such
as Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and Conditional Average Treatment Effect
(CATE). This approach offers network operators guided insights into identifying
conflicts and quantifying their impacts, enabling more informed and effective
conflict resolution strategies across diverse xApp deployments.

TL;DR: NeTestLLM是一个基于多智能体大语言模型的端到端自动化网络协议测试系统，能够自动生成测试用例并提高测试效率8.65倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网络协议测试方法劳动密集且容易出错，每个测试用例需要1人天的工作量。现有基于模型的方法虽然提供部分自动化，但仍需要大量人工建模和专家干预，成本高且难以适应多样化和不断演进的协议。

Method: 采用多智能体LLM进行分层协议理解以捕获复杂规范，迭代测试用例生成以提高覆盖率，特定任务工作流生成可执行工件，运行时反馈分析用于调试和改进。

Result: 在实验中为OSPF、RIP和BGP协议生成了4,632个测试用例，覆盖了41个历史FRRouting错误，而现行国家标准仅覆盖11个。生成可执行工件的效率比人工方法提高了8.65倍。

Conclusion: NeTestLLM为异构网络协议的自动化端到端测试提供了首个实用的LLM驱动解决方案，已在生产环境中部署数月并获得领域专家的积极反馈。

Abstract: Network protocol testing is fundamental for modern network infrastructure.
However, traditional network protocol testing methods are labor-intensive and
error-prone, requiring manual interpretation of specifications, test case
design, and translation into executable artifacts, typically demanding one
person-day of effort per test case. Existing model-based approaches provide
partial automation but still involve substantial manual modeling and expert
intervention, leading to high costs and limited adaptability to diverse and
evolving protocols. In this paper, we propose a first-of-its-kind system called
NeTestLLM that takes advantage of multi-agent Large Language Models (LLMs) for
end-to-end automated network protocol testing. NeTestLLM employs hierarchical
protocol understanding to capture complex specifications, iterative test case
generation to improve coverage, a task-specific workflow for executable
artifact generation, and runtime feedback analysis for debugging and
refinement. NeTestLLM has been deployed in a production environment for several
months, receiving positive feedback from domain experts. In experiments,
NeTestLLM generated 4,632 test cases for OSPF, RIP, and BGP, covering 41
historical FRRouting bugs compared to 11 by current national standards. The
process of generating executable artifacts also improves testing efficiency by
a factor of 8.65x compared to manual methods. NeTestLLM provides the first
practical LLM-powered solution for automated end-to-end testing of
heterogeneous network protocols.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了NetMCP平台和SONAR算法，通过结合语义相似性和网络QoS指标来增强MCP工具路由，解决现有系统在网络延迟波动或服务器故障时的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM扩展功能依赖MCP协议，但现有实现仅基于语义匹配，在网络延迟波动或服务器故障时表现脆弱，需要增强实时网络和服务器状态感知能力。

Method: 构建NetMCP异构实验平台，提供五种代表性网络状态，并提出SONAR算法联合优化语义相似性和网络QoS指标进行自适应工具路由。

Result: SONAR相比仅基于语义或LLM的基线方法，持续提高了任务成功率，减少了完成时间和失败次数。

Conclusion: 网络感知设计对生产级LLM系统具有重要价值，SONAR算法能有效提升系统鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain static in functionality after training,
and extending their capabilities requires integration with external data,
computation, and services. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a
standard interface for such extensions, but current implementations rely solely
on semantic matching between users' requests and server function descriptions,
which makes current deployments and simulation testbeds fragile under latency
fluctuations or server failures. We address this gap by enhancing MCP tool
routing algorithms with real-time awareness of network and server status. To
provide a controlled test environment for development and evaluation, we
construct a heterogeneous experimental platform, namely Network-aware MCP
(NetMCP), which offers five representative network states and build a benchmark
for latency sequence generation and MCP server datasets. On top of NetMCP
platform, we analyze latency sequences and propose a Semantic-Oriented and
Network-Aware Routing (SONAR) algorithm, which jointly optimizes semantic
similarity and network Quality of Service (QoS) metrics for adaptive tool
routing. Results show that SONAR consistently improves task success rate and
reduces completion time and failure number compared with semantic-only,
LLM-based baselines, demonstrating the value of network-aware design for
production-scale LLM systems. The code for NetMCP is available at

TL;DR: Tommy系统通过概率模型比较噪声时间戳，提出likely-happened-before关系，为公平排序提供新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件公平排序问题，传统方法受限于时钟同步精度，需要新方法处理时钟误差。

Method: 使用统计模型学习每个时钟的偏移分布，概率性地比较两个噪声时间戳，计算事件发生的先后概率。

Result: 提出likely-happened-before关系，能够对传统happened-before关系认为并发的事件进行排序。

Conclusion: 该方法为公平排序提供了新基础，但面临likely-happened-before关系不可传递等挑战，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: A growing class of applications demands \emph{fair ordering/sequencing} of
events which ensures that events generated earlier by one client are processed
before later events from other clients. However, achieving such sequencing is
fundamentally challenging due to the inherent limitations of clock
synchronization. We advocate for an approach that embraces, rather than
eliminates, clock variability. Instead of attempting to remove error from a
timestamp, Tommy, our proposed system, leverages a statistical model to compare
two noisy timestamps probabilistically by learning per-clock offset
distributions. Our preliminary statistical model computes the probability that
one event precedes another w.r.t. the wall-clock time without access to the
wall-clock. This serves as a foundation for a new relation:
\emph{likely-happened-before} denoted by $\xrightarrow{p}$ where $p$ represents
the probability of an event to have happened before another. The
$\xrightarrow{p}$ relation provides a basis for ordering multiple events which
are otherwise considered \emph{concurrent} by the typical
\emph{happened-before} ($\rightarrow$) relation. We highlight various related
challenges including intransitivity of $\xrightarrow{p}$ relation as opposed to
the transitive $\rightarrow$ relation. We also outline several research
directions: online fair sequencing, stochastically fair total ordering,
host-level support for fairness and more.

TL;DR: 提出在卫星网络中部署内容副本服务器，优化副本放置策略以降低延迟、传输和存储成本，支持LEO、MEO、GEO等多种卫星网络类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星通信为偏远地区提供互联网连接，但传输成本远高于传统互联网，需要降低内容传输成本。

Method: 在卫星网络中放置内容副本服务器，考虑卫星移动轨迹，优化客户端性能和卫星间内容传输成本。

Result: 通过模拟流量轨迹和原型系统验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效降低卫星网络中的内容传输成本，提高性能。

Abstract: Satellite communication offers Internet connectivity to remote locations,
such as villages, deserts, mountains, and at sea. However, transmitting content
over satellite networks is significantly more expensive than traditional
Internet. To address this issue, we propose placing content replica servers
within satellite networks and optimizing replica placement for important
performance metrics, such as latency, transmission, and storage cost. Our
approach can support different types of satellite networks, including Low Earth
Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), Geostationary Orbit (GEO), and their
combinations. An important challenge for supporting content replicas in such
networks is that LEO and MEO satellites are constantly moving. We address this
challenge by explicitly considering their moving trajectories and strategically
optimizing not only client performance, but also the cost of transferring
content from one satellite to another as needed. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach using both simulated traffic traces and a
prototype system.

TL;DR: 本文首次全面测量分析了Starlink卫星互联网在PoP、DNS和CDN层面的网页内容分发性能，发现基础设施密度决定性能表现，卫星覆盖并非主要影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低地球轨道卫星互联网提供商承诺提供全球互联网连接，但其与内容分发网络的交互机制尚未得到充分理解，需要进行系统性测量研究。

Method: 通过两年测量，结合22.5万次Cloudflare AIM测试、M-Lab数据，以及从99个RIPE Atlas和受控Starlink探针的主动探测，收集了610万条路由追踪和1080万次DNS查询。

Result: 识别出三种性能模式：基础设施密集区域接近地面网络延迟；基础设施稀疏区域因远程PoP导致DNS解析器选择不当和CDN定位错误，延迟超过200ms；利用2025年初Starlink基础设施扩展实验显示，将PoP靠近用户可将页面获取时间中位数减少60%。

Conclusion: 基础设施邻近性而非卫星覆盖影响网页性能，卫星互联网需要CDN映射和DNS解析的根本性改变。

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite ISPs promise universal Internet connectivity,
yet their interaction with content delivery remains poorly understood. We
present the first comprehensive measurement study decomposing Starlink's web
content delivery performance decomposed across Point of Presence (PoP), DNS,
and CDN layers. Through two years of measurements combining 225K Cloudflare AIM
tests, M-Lab data, and active probing from 99 RIPE Atlas and controlled
Starlink probes, we collect 6.1M traceroutes and 10.8M DNS queries to quantify
how satellite architecture disrupts terrestrial CDN assumptions. We identify
three distinct performance regimes based on infrastructure density. Regions
with local content-rich PoPs achieve near-terrestrial latencies with the
satellite segment dominating 80-90% of RTT. Infrastructure-sparse regions
suffer cascading penalties: remote PoPs force distant resolver selection, which
triggers CDN mis-localization, pushing latencies beyond 200 ms.
Dense-infrastructure regions show minimal sensitivity to PoP changes.
Leveraging Starlink's infrastructure expansion in early 2025 as a natural
experiment, we demonstrate that relocating PoPs closer to user location reduces
median page-fetch times by 60%. Our findings reveal that infrastructure
proximity, not satellite coverage, influences web performance, requiring
fundamental changes to CDN mapping and DNS resolution for satellite ISPs.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了两种动态可扩展的导频分配策略来解决分布式大规模MIMO系统中的导频污染问题：一种是低复杂度集中式算法，另一种是完全分布式算法，均能显著提升网络吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 导频污染是分布式大规模MIMO系统实现其全部潜力的主要瓶颈，需要设计实用的导频分配策略来改善信道估计质量并减少用户间干扰。

Method: 1. 集中式算法：顺序分配导频给用户设备，以最小化服务接入点的全局信道估计误差；2. 分布式算法：基于优先级的导频选择方法，每个接入点使用本地信息最小化估计误差，用户根据接入点优先级选择合适的导频。

Result: 数值仿真表明，所提出的方案在网络吞吐量方面优于其他最先进的基准方案，显著减少了导频污染。

Conclusion: 提出的集中式和分布式导频分配策略能有效解决导频污染问题，提高频谱效率，且分布式方法无需全局协调，保持低信令开销并动态适应用户部署。

Abstract: Pilot contamination remains a major bottleneck in realizing the full
potential of distributed massive MIMO systems. We propose two dynamic and
scalable pilot assignment strategies designed for practical deployment in such
networks. First, we present a low complexity centralized algorithm that
sequentially assigns pilots to user equipments (UEs) to minimize the global
channel estimation errors across serving access points (APs). This improves the
channel estimation quality and reduces interference among UEs, enhancing the
spectral efficiency. Second, we develop a fully distributed algorithm that uses
a priority-based pilot selection approach. In this algorithm, each selected AP
minimizes estimation error using only local information and offers candidate
pilots to the UEs. Every UE then selects a suitable pilot based on AP priority.
This approach ensures consistency and minimizes interference while
significantly reducing pilot contamination. The method requires no global
coordination, maintains low signaling overhead, and adapts dynamically to the
UE deployment. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed schemes in terms of network throughput when compared to other
state-of-the-art benchmark schemes.

TL;DR: 提出了LT-Gate脉冲神经元模型，通过双时间尺度动态和自适应门控机制解决SNN在持续学习中的稳定性-可塑性困境，在时序分类任务中实现51%的准确率，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络在神经形态硬件上具有能效优势，但在需要快速适应和长期记忆的持续学习任务中表现不佳，特别是面临稳定性-可塑性困境。

Method: LT-Gate模型让每个脉冲神经元并行跟踪快速和慢速时间尺度信息，通过学习的门控机制局部调整其影响，并结合方差跟踪正则化稳定放电活动。

Result: 在时序分类基准测试中达到约51%的最终准确率，优于Hebbian持续学习基线的46%和先前SNN方法，且无需外部重放或昂贵正交化。

Conclusion: 多时间尺度门控可显著增强SNN的持续学习能力，缩小脉冲网络与传统深度网络在终身学习任务上的差距，并完全兼容神经形态硬件。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient artificial
intelligence on neuromorphic hardware but struggle with tasks requiring both
fast adaptation and long-term memory, especially in continual learning. We
propose Local Timescale Gating (LT-Gate), a neuron model that combines dual
time-constant dynamics with an adaptive gating mechanism. Each spiking neuron
tracks information on a fast and a slow timescale in parallel, and a learned
gate locally adjusts their influence. This design enables individual neurons to
preserve slow contextual information while responding to fast signals,
addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma. We further introduce a
variance-tracking regularization that stabilizes firing activity, inspired by
biological homeostasis. Empirically, LT-Gate yields significantly improved
accuracy and retention in sequential learning tasks: on a challenging temporal
classification benchmark it achieves about 51 percent final accuracy, compared
to about 46 percent for a recent Hebbian continual-learning baseline and lower
for prior SNN methods. Unlike approaches that require external replay or
expensive orthogonalizations, LT-Gate operates with local updates and is fully
compatible with neuromorphic hardware. In particular, it leverages features of
Intel's Loihi chip (multiple synaptic traces with different decay rates) for
on-chip learning. Our results demonstrate that multi-timescale gating can
substantially enhance continual learning in SNNs, narrowing the gap between
spiking and conventional deep networks on lifelong-learning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM4TS模型中的伪对齐问题，发现其源于预训练LLM的锥效应和时间序列数据低维流形的相互作用，并提出TimeSUP方法通过增加时间序列流形维度来缓解该问题，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪对齐问题是导致许多时间序列大语言模型表现不佳的关键因素，但社区对此问题的根源讨论有限。本文旨在深入探究伪对齐的成因并开发解决方案。

Method: 提出了TimeSUP方法，通过增加时间序列流形维度使其更接近语言嵌入的内在维度，从而让模型能够清晰区分时间信号，同时捕捉跨模态的共享结构。

Result: TimeSUP在长期预测性能上持续优于最先进的LLM4TS方法和其他轻量级基线，并且可以无缝集成到四种现有LLM4TS管道中，显著提升预测性能。

Conclusion: 伪对齐源于预训练LLM的锥效应与时间序列数据低维流形的相互作用，TimeSUP通过调整流形维度有效缓解了这一问题，为LLM4TS模型提供了更好的表示学习能力。

Abstract: Pseudo-Alignment is a pervasive challenge in many large language models for
time series (LLM4TS) models, often causing them to underperform compared to
linear models or randomly initialised backbones. However, there is limited
discussion in the community for the reasons that pseudo-alignment occurs. In
this work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of
pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the
cone effect in LLM. We demonstrate that pseudo-alignment arises from the
interplay of cone effect within pretrained LLM components and the intrinsically
low-dimensional manifold of time-series data. In addition, we also introduce
\textit{\textbf{TimeSUP}}, a novel technique designed to mitigate this issue
and improve forecast performance in existing LLM4TS approaches. TimeSUP
addresses this by increasing the time series manifold to more closely match the
intrinsic dimension of language embeddings, allowing the model to distinguish
temporal signals clearly while still capturing shared structures across
modalities. As a result, representations for time and language tokens remain
distinct yet exhibit high cosine similarity, signifying that the model
preserves each modality unique features while learning their commonalities in a
unified embedding space. Empirically, TimeSUP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and other lightweight baselines on long-term
forecasting performance. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into four
existing LLM4TS pipelines and delivers significant improvements in forecasting
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决联邦学习中任务增量学习面临的统计异质性、遗忘问题和隐私约束等挑战。

Method: 客户端使用Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder生成高斯分布的任务嵌入，服务器端使用2-Wasserstein距离测量任务间差距并制定Wasserstein损失来增强任务分离。

Result: 在多个流行数据集上的实验表明，FedGTEA实现了优越的分类性能，显著减轻了遗忘问题，并持续优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FedGTEA通过概率化任务嵌入和对齐，在联邦类增量学习中实现了高效的知识捕获和遗忘缓解，同时满足隐私保护要求。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning,
called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is
designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable
and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the
Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task
embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and
quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size
regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task
sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to
measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the
Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic
formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves
task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings,
aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive
empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves
superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting,
consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.

Motivation: 利用物理系统自然执行能量下降的特性来加速机器学习，特别是将伊辛机的GHz频率动态与能量基模型优化和梯度下降相结合，同时利用固有噪声支持采样。

Method: 在振荡器伊辛机上实现平衡传播（EP），通过局部学习规则在单一总能量景观上进行下降，无需全局反向传播。

Result: 在MNIST上达到约97.2±0.1%的准确率，在Fashion-MNIST上达到约88.0±0.1%的准确率，且在参数量化和相位噪声等实际硬件约束下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 振荡器伊辛机为神经形态学习提供了快速、节能的基底，表明能量基模型可以在直接执行其优化的物理硬件上实现实际应用。

Abstract: Physical systems that naturally perform energy descent offer a direct route
to accelerating machine learning. Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) exemplify
this idea: their GHz-frequency dynamics mirror both the optimization of
energy-based models (EBMs) and gradient descent on loss landscapes, while
intrinsic noise corresponds to Langevin dynamics - supporting sampling as well
as optimization. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) unifies these processes into
descent on a single total energy landscape, enabling local learning rules
without global backpropagation. We show that EP on OIMs achieves competitive
accuracy ($\sim 97.2 \pm 0.1 \%$ on MNIST, $\sim 88.0 \pm 0.1 \%$ on
Fashion-MNIST), while maintaining robustness under realistic hardware
constraints such as parameter quantization and phase noise. These results
establish OIMs as a fast, energy-efficient substrate for neuromorphic learning,
and suggest that EBMs - often bottlenecked by conventional processors - may
find practical realization on physical hardware whose dynamics directly perform
their optimization.

TL;DR: 该论文首次为状态对抗马尔可夫决策过程(SA-MDPs)中的剪枝认证鲁棒性建立了理论框架，证明了剪枝只会增强策略的鲁棒性，并揭示了性能-鲁棒性权衡边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的强化学习策略需要在对抗扰动下保持可靠性，而现代深度RL代理过度参数化导致成本高和脆弱性。虽然剪枝在监督学习中已被证明能提高鲁棒性，但在对抗RL中的作用尚不清楚。

Method: 开发了SA-MDPs中剪枝认证鲁棒性的理论框架，分析了高斯和分类策略，推导了三项遗憾分解，并在连续控制基准上评估了幅度剪枝和微剪枝策略。

Result: 剪枝在中等稀疏度水平下始终发现可复现的"最佳点"，鲁棒性显著提高而不损害（有时甚至增强）干净性能。

Conclusion: 剪枝不仅是压缩工具，更是实现鲁棒RL的结构性干预手段。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in real-world environments must
remain reliable under adversarial perturbations. At the same time, modern deep
RL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns.
While pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its
role in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first
theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in
state-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and
categorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise
pruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the
policy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret
decomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced
performance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental
performance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and
micro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong
policy-aware adversaries. Across tasks, pruning consistently uncovers
reproducible ``sweet spots'' at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness
improves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean
performance. These results position pruning not merely as a compression tool
but as a structural intervention for robust RL.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale de-identified electronic health
records (EHRs) hold promise for clinical applications. However, their capacity
to memorize patient information raises important privacy concerns. In this
work, we introduce a suite of black-box evaluation tests to assess
privacy-related memorization risks in foundation models trained on structured
EHR data. Our framework includes methods for probing memorization at both the
embedding and generative levels, and aims to distinguish between model
generalization and harmful memorization in clinically relevant settings. We
contextualize memorization in terms of its potential to compromise patient
privacy, particularly for vulnerable subgroups. We validate our approach on a
publicly available EHR foundation model and release an open-source toolkit to
facilitate reproducible and collaborative privacy assessments in healthcare AI.

Result: 在两个大型真实世界信用数据集上的实验表明，CI-EX在拒绝推断特定指标（如Kickout和新提出的Area under the Kickout）上始终优于现有方法，同时在大多数实验中保持AUC的竞争力。

Conclusion: 拒绝推断方法通常需要在AUC和拒绝推断特定指标之间权衡，但提出的CI-EX框架在保持AUC竞争力的同时，在拒绝推断特定指标上表现更优。

Abstract: Reject Inference (RI) methods aim to address sample bias by inferring missing
repayment data for rejected credit applicants. Traditional approaches often
assume that the behavior of rejected clients can be extrapolated from accepted
clients, despite potential distributional differences between the two
populations. To mitigate this blind extrapolation, we propose a novel Confident
Inlier Extrapolation framework (CI-EX). CI-EX iteratively identifies the
distribution of rejected client samples using an outlier detection model and
assigns labels to rejected individuals closest to the distribution of the
accepted population based on probabilities derived from a supervised
classification model. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is validated
through experiments on two large real-world credit datasets. Performance is
evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as well as RI-specific metrics
such as Kickout and a novel metric introduced in this work, denoted as Area
under the Kickout. Our findings reveal that RI methods, including the proposed
framework, generally involve a trade-off between AUC and RI-specific metrics.
However, the proposed CI-EX framework consistently outperforms existing RI
models from the credit literature in terms of RI-specific metrics while
maintaining competitive performance in AUC across most experiments.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用去噪分数匹配损失作为局部内在维度(LID)的估计器，相比现有方法具有更好的计算效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LID估计方法需要多次前向传播或梯度计算，在计算和内存受限的场景中应用受限，需要寻找更高效的LID估计方法。

Method: 证明LID是去噪分数匹配损失的下界，从而将去噪分数匹配损失作为LID估计器。同时分析隐式分数匹配损失与LID的关系。

Result: 在流形基准测试和Stable Diffusion 3.5上的实验表明，去噪分数匹配损失在准确性和内存占用方面具有竞争优势，随着问题规模和量化级别的增加表现更优。

Conclusion: 去噪分数匹配损失是一种高效且可扩展的LID估计器，特别适用于计算和内存受限的场景。

Abstract: The local intrinsic dimension (LID) of data is a fundamental quantity in
signal processing and learning theory, but quantifying the LID of
high-dimensional, complex data has been a historically challenging task. Recent
works have discovered that diffusion models capture the LID of data through the
spectra of their score estimates and through the rate of change of their
density estimates under various noise perturbations. While these methods can
accurately quantify LID, they require either many forward passes of the
diffusion model or use of gradient computation, limiting their applicability in
compute- and memory-constrained scenarios.
  We show that the LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss,
motivating use of the denoising score matching loss as a LID estimator.
Moreover, we show that the equivalent implicit score matching loss also
approximates LID via the normal dimension and is closely related to a recent
LID estimator, FLIPD. Our experiments on a manifold benchmark and with Stable
Diffusion 3.5 indicate that the denoising score matching loss is a highly
competitive and scalable LID estimator, achieving superior accuracy and memory
footprint under increasing problem size and quantization level.

TL;DR: 提出FADE指标，通过比较未学习模型与参考模型在生成样本上的双向似然分配来衡量分布相似性，解决了现有遗忘评估方法的盲点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型的遗忘评估指标依赖参考响应或分类器输出，而非评估核心目标：未学习模型是否与从未见过不需要数据的模型行为无法区分。这种方法存在系统性盲点，允许模型在保留不需要知识的同时显得成功。

Method: 提出功能对齐分布等价性(FADE)指标，通过比较未学习模型和参考模型在生成样本上的双向似然分配来测量分布相似性，捕获整个输出分布的功能对齐。

Result: 在TOFU和UnlearnCanvas基准测试中，传统指标接近最优的方法未能实现分布等价性，许多模型在遗忘后与黄金标准距离反而更大。

Conclusion: 当前评估实践存在根本性差距，FADE为开发和评估真正有效的遗忘方法提供了更稳健的基础。

Abstract: Current unlearning metrics for generative models evaluate success based on
reference responses or classifier outputs rather than assessing the core
objective: whether the unlearned model behaves indistinguishably from a model
that never saw the unwanted data. This reference-specific approach creates
systematic blind spots, allowing models to appear successful while retaining
unwanted knowledge accessible through alternative prompts or attacks. We
address these limitations by proposing Functional Alignment for Distributional
Equivalence (FADE), a novel metric that measures distributional similarity
between unlearned and reference models by comparing bidirectional likelihood
assignments over generated samples. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
predetermined references, FADE captures functional alignment across the entire
output distribution, providing a principled assessment of genuine unlearning.
Our experiments on the TOFU benchmark for LLM unlearning and the UnlearnCanvas
benchmark for text-to-image diffusion model unlearning reveal that methods
achieving near-optimal scores on traditional metrics fail to achieve
distributional equivalence, with many becoming more distant from the gold
standard than before unlearning. These findings expose fundamental gaps in
current evaluation practices and demonstrate that FADE provides a more robust
foundation for developing and assessing truly effective unlearning methods.

TL;DR: AdaLog是一个轻量级自适应系统，通过消除特征级冗余数据和优化异构行为存储，显著减少移动应用中用户行为日志的存储开销，同时保持模型推理精度和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在移动应用中的普及，记录用户行为数据带来了巨大的存储成本，导致系统响应性下降和更多应用卸载。现有工业实践中存在特征冗余和存储稀疏的问题。

Method: 1) 将特征级冗余数据消除建模为超图中的最大加权匹配问题，提出分层算法；2) 使用虚拟哈希属性设计将异构行为分布到少量日志文件中；3) 设计增量更新机制以适应动态用户行为模式。

Result: 在实际用户数据上的评估显示，AdaLog将行为日志大小减少了19%到44%，系统开销极小（仅2秒延迟和15MB内存使用）。

Conclusion: AdaLog为更广泛采用设备端机器学习提供了更高效的数据基础，解决了移动应用中用户行为日志存储的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into modern mobile
apps to enable personalized and intelligent services. These models typically
rely on rich input features derived from historical user behaviors to capture
user intents. However, as ML-driven services become more prevalent, recording
necessary user behavior data imposes substantial storage cost on mobile apps,
leading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. To address this
storage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system
designed to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded
mobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We
identify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user
behavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across
different features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing
behaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To
solve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level
redundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and
proposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,
AdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous
behaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to
ensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an
incremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting
outdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into
popular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner. Evaluations on
real-world user data show that AdaLog reduces behavior log size by 19% to 44%
with minimal system overhead (only 2 seconds latency and 15 MB memory usage),
providing a more efficient data foundation for broader adoption of on-device
ML.

TL;DR: CSI-4CAST是一个用于大规模MIMO系统CSI预测的混合深度学习架构，通过整合CNN残差、自适应校正层、ShuffleNet块和Transformer，有效捕获局部和长程依赖关系，在计算效率和预测精度方面均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的CSI预测方法在应对实际非高斯噪声、跨信道条件泛化能力和计算效率方面存在局限性，需要开发更鲁棒和高效的预测模型。

Method: 提出混合深度学习架构CSI-4CAST，整合四个关键组件：卷积神经网络残差、自适应校正层、ShuffleNet块和Transformer，以高效捕获CSI预测中的局部和长程依赖关系。

Result: CSI-4CAST在88.9%的TDD场景和43.8%的FDD场景中优于基线模型，计算量比最强基线LLM4CP减少5倍（TDD）和3倍（FDD），同时建立了包含30多万样本的CSI-RRG基准数据集。

Conclusion: CSI-4CAST在CSI预测精度和计算效率方面均表现优异，建立的CSI-RRG基准数据集为深度学习模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力评估提供了标准化平台。

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) prediction is a promising strategy for
ensuring reliable and efficient operation of massive multiple-input
multiple-output (mMIMO) systems by providing timely downlink (DL) CSI. While
deep learning-based methods have advanced beyond conventional model-driven and
statistical approaches, they remain limited in robustness to practical
non-Gaussian noise, generalization across diverse channel conditions, and
computational efficiency. This paper introduces CSI-4CAST, a hybrid deep
learning architecture that integrates 4 key components, i.e., Convolutional
neural network residuals, Adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and
Transformers, to efficiently capture both local and long-range dependencies in
CSI prediction. To enable rigorous evaluation, this work further presents a
comprehensive benchmark, CSI-RRG for Regular, Robustness and Generalization
testing, which includes more than 300,000 samples across 3,060 realistic
scenarios for both TDD and FDD systems. The dataset spans multiple channel
models, a wide range of delay spreads and user velocities, and diverse noise
types and intensity degrees. Experimental results show that CSI-4CAST achieves
superior prediction accuracy with substantially lower computational cost,
outperforming baselines in 88.9% of TDD scenarios and 43.8% of FDD scenario,
the best performance among all evaluated models, while reducing FLOPs by 5x and
3x compared to LLM4CP, the strongest baseline. In addition, evaluation over
CSI-RRG provides valuable insights into how different channel factors affect
the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models. Both the
dataset (https://huggingface.co/CSI-4CAST) and evaluation protocols
(https://github.com/AI4OPT/CSI-4CAST) are publicly released to establish a
standardized benchmark and to encourage further research on robust and
efficient CSI prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs在数学推理能力中的具体来源和机制，特别是优化推理（在约束条件下寻找极值）这一基础抽象能力。

Method: 构建ExtremBench基准数据集，包含93个标准化极值寻找问题，源自中国数学奥林匹克竞赛的不等式练习，并对多个先进开源模型家族进行广泛评估。

Result: LLMs的极值求解推理能力与当前数学基准（如AIME25和MATH-500）并不总是一致，有些模型表现出强大的通用数学推理但极值求解能力差，反之亦然。

Conclusion: 现有评估实践存在关键差距，现有基准可能无法全面捕捉数学推理能力的全谱，需要更专门的评估工具。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable
reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through
intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers.
However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning
capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e.
finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that
underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and
prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems,
curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and
transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct
extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model
families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that
LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of
current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models
showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills,
and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current
evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not
comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

Motivation: 刚性系统的时间积分是燃烧、高超声速等反应输运系统的主要计算成本来源。传统显式方法需要极小时间步长，隐式方法计算密集，需要缓解刚性带来的挑战。

Method: 开发AMORE框架，包含多输出预测算子和自适应损失函数。使用可逆分析映射将n维物种质量分数转换为(n-1)维空间进行DeepONet训练，设计自动满足单位分割的trunk网络，采用两步训练方法。

Conclusion: AMORE是一个通用框架，不仅适用于DeepONet，也适用于FNO，将成为未来CFD研究中加速湍流燃烧模拟的骨干网络。

Abstract: Time integration of stiff systems is a primary source of computational cost
in combustion, hypersonics, and other reactive transport systems. This
stiffness can introduce time scales significantly smaller than those associated
with other physical processes, requiring extremely small time steps in explicit
schemes or computationally intensive implicit methods. Consequently, strategies
to alleviate challenges posed by stiffness are important. While neural
operators (DeepONets) can act as surrogates for stiff kinetics, a reliable
operator learning strategy is required to appropriately account for differences
in the error between output variables and samples. Here, we develop AMORE,
Adaptive Multi-Output Operator Network, a framework comprising an operator
capable of predicting multiple outputs and adaptive loss functions ensuring
reliable operator learning. The operator predicts all thermochemical states
from given initial conditions. We propose two adaptive loss functions within
the framework, considering each state variable's and sample's error to penalize
the loss function. We designed the trunk to automatically satisfy Partition of
Unity. To enforce unity mass-fraction constraint exactly, we propose an
invertible analytical map that transforms the $n$-dimensional species
mass-fraction vector into an ($n-1$)-dimensional space, where DeepONet training
is performed. We consider two-step training for DeepONet for multiple outputs
and extend adaptive loss functions for trunk and branch training. We
demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of our models through two examples:
the syngas (12 states) and GRI-Mech 3.0 (24 active states out of 54). The
proposed DeepONet will be a backbone for future CFD studies to accelerate
turbulent combustion simulations. AMORE is a general framework, and here, in
addition to DeepONet, we also demonstrate it for FNO.

Conclusion: 提出的多阶段强化学习初始化策略能够有效改善单细胞扰动建模的性能，避免局部最优问题

Abstract: Modeling cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations remains a
central challenge in single-cell biology. Existing data-driven framework have
advanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically
conditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However,
these models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of
cell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in
spurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable
gene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design
frameworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet,
an approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to
escape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this
work, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for
single-cell perturbation modeling. We first compute an explicit natural
gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver,
scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware the
first step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we
then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped
surrogates, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We
demonstrate that this initialization substantially improves generalization on
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing
(scATAC-seq) pertubation analysis.

Conclusion: 提出的工作流成功解决了焊缝检测中的数据稀缺和信号干扰问题，实现了工业环境下可靠的自动化检测。

Abstract: Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the
nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training
data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity
simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings
(resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end
machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e.,
industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the
challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow
consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution
alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order
Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive
dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively
inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion
models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set
of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD)
real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions,
i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution
representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed
by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end
solution for automated weld inspection on real data.

Conclusion: 通过信息论视角重新思考Koopman学习，提出的方法能够有效平衡简洁性和表达能力，获得稳定且可解释的Koopman表示。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical
systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community.
However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable
finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We
argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning,
where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This
tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma:
constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive.
Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent
mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may
cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast,
expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such
collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an
information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this
tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian
formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a
stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative
evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our
representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical
predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of
dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman
learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.

Abstract: Computer models are indispensable tools for understanding the Earth system.
While high-resolution operational models have achieved many successes, they
exhibit persistent biases, particularly in simulating extreme events and
statistical distributions. In contrast, coarse-grained idealized models isolate
fundamental processes and can be precisely calibrated to excel in
characterizing specific dynamical and statistical features. However, different
models remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of models of varying complexity, we develop an
explainable AI framework for Earth system emulators. It bridges the model
hierarchy through a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique, uniquely
suited to exploit the sparse output from the idealized models. The resulting
bridging model inherits the high resolution and comprehensive variables of
operational models while achieving global accuracy enhancements through
targeted improvements from idealized models. Crucially, the mechanism of AI
provides a clear rationale for these advancements, moving beyond black-box
correction to physically insightful understanding in a computationally
efficient framework that enables effective physics-assisted digital twins and
uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its power by significantly
correcting biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Ni\~no spatiotemporal patterns,
leveraging statistically accurate idealized models. This work also highlights
the importance of pushing idealized model development and advancing
communication between modeling communities.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, which predicts rainfall up to a few hours ahead, is
a critical tool for vulnerable communities in the Global South frequently
exposed to intense, rapidly developing storms. Timely forecasts provide a
crucial window to protect lives and livelihoods. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) methods suffer from high latency, low spatial and temporal
resolution, and significant gaps in accuracy across the world. Recent machine
learning-based nowcasting methods, common in the Global North, cannot be
extended to the Global South due to extremely sparse radar coverage. We present
Global MetNet, an operational global machine learning nowcasting model. It
leverages the Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary
satellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for the next 12
hours. The model operates at a high resolution of approximately 0.05{\deg}
(~5km) spatially and 15 minutes temporally. Global MetNet significantly
outperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts and achieves significantly
higher skill, making forecasts useful over a much larger area of the world than
previously available. Our model demonstrates better skill in data-sparse
regions than even the best high-resolution NWP models achieve in the US.
Validated using ground radar and satellite data, it shows significant
improvements across key metrics like the critical success index and fractions

### [55] [Time-Varying Optimization for Streaming Data Via Temporal Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13052)
*Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar,Nicolò Michelusi,Erik G. Larsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从时变优化的角度研究流数据学习问题，提出了基于权重的结构化公式，分析了均匀权重和折扣权重两种策略下的跟踪误差性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化理论处理固定目标函数，但在动态环境中需要时变优化方法。本文旨在通过时变优化视角研究流数据学习问题，明确捕捉流数据来源的时间变化特性。

Method: 引入基于权重的结构化公式，其中每个时间步最小化所有过去数据样本的加权平均损失。研究两种权重策略：均匀权重（平等对待所有样本）和折扣权重（几何衰减旧数据影响）。使用梯度下降更新，推导跟踪误差的紧界。

Result: 均匀权重下跟踪误差渐近消失，衰减率为O(1/t)；折扣权重会产生非零误差下限，由折扣因子和每个时间步的梯度更新次数控制。数值模拟验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 本文为流数据学习提供了时变优化的理论框架，量化了不同权重策略下的跟踪误差性能，为动态环境中的决策制定提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective
functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important
subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the
problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization
lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a
structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the
streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step,
an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data
samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,
which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which
geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive
tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between
the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under
gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE
vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas
discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount
factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our
theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了KL正则化在博弈论环境中的理论优势，提出了OMG和SOMG算法，在矩阵博弈和马尔可夫博弈中实现了与KL正则化强度β成反比的对数遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管KL正则化在强化学习对齐中取得了经验成功，但其在博弈论环境中的理论优势仍不清楚，需要开发可证明具有改进样本效率的算法。

Method: 提出了OMG算法（用于矩阵博弈）和SOMG算法（用于马尔可夫博弈），基于最佳响应采样和乐观奖励，其中SOMG还使用了超乐观奖励的新概念。

Result: 两种算法都实现了与T成对数关系的遗憾，且该遗憾与KL正则化强度β成反比，同时保持了与β无关的标准√T遗憾。

Conclusion: KL正则化在博弈论环境中确实能提供理论优势，显著提高样本效率，特别是在强正则化情况下效果更明显。

Abstract: Reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization with respect to
a fixed reference policy is widely used in modern reinforcement learning to
preserve the desired traits of the reference policy and sometimes to promote
exploration (using uniform reference policy, known as entropy regularization).
Beyond serving as a mere anchor, the reference policy can also be interpreted
as encoding prior knowledge about good actions in the environment. In the
context of alignment, recent game-theoretic approaches have leveraged KL
regularization with pretrained language models as reference policies, achieving
notable empirical success in self-play methods. Despite these advances, the
theoretical benefits of KL regularization in game-theoretic settings remain
poorly understood. In this work, we develop and analyze algorithms that
provably achieve improved sample efficiency under KL regularization. We study
both two-player zero-sum Matrix games and Markov games: for Matrix games, we
propose OMG, an algorithm based on best response sampling with optimistic
bonuses, and extend this idea to Markov games through the algorithm SOMG, which
also uses best response sampling and a novel concept of superoptimistic
bonuses. Both algorithms achieve a logarithmic regret in $T$ that scales
inversely with the KL regularization strength $\beta$ in addition to the
standard $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret independent of $\beta$
which is attained in both regularized and unregularized settings

Result: 在多个合成和真实数据集上验证了新指数的性能，并与广泛使用的聚类有效性指数进行了比较。

Conclusion: 提出的紧凑性和可分性指数能够有效识别真实簇数，为聚类分析提供了新的绝对评估工具。

Abstract: Finding "true" clusters in a data set is a challenging problem. Clustering
solutions obtained using different models and algorithms do not necessarily
provide compact and well-separated clusters or the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster validity indices are commonly applied to identify such clusters.
Nevertheless, these indices are typically relative, and they are used to
compare clustering algorithms or choose the parameters of a clustering
algorithm. Moreover, the success of these indices depends on the underlying
data structure. This paper introduces novel absolute cluster indices to
determine both the compactness and separability of clusters. We define a
compactness function for each cluster and a set of neighboring points for
cluster pairs. This function is utilized to determine the compactness of each
cluster and the whole cluster distribution. The set of neighboring points is
used to define the margin between clusters and the overall distribution margin.
The proposed compactness and separability indices are applied to identify the
true number of clusters. Using a number of synthetic and real-world data sets,
we demonstrate the performance of these new indices and compare them with other
widely-used cluster validity indices.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) captures neural activity across multiple
temporal and spectral scales, yielding signals that are rich but complex for
representation learning. Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict
masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable
representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal
tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve
high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with
high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM)
centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i)
multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural
spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for
high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware
loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG
compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency
bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results
demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms
existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ
tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose
brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and
multimodal biosignal integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统波束成形方法如WMMSE计算复杂度高，难以满足大规模MISO系统的实时性要求，需要开发高效的深度学习解决方案。

Method: 采用学习优化范式，使用多层Transformer通过残差连接迭代优化信道和波束成形特征，并引入课程学习、半摊销学习和滑动窗口训练三种策略来增强训练效果。

Result: 在低到中SNR下优于现有基线方法，在高SNR下接近WMMSE性能，同时推理速度显著快于迭代和在线学习方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模MU-MISO系统提供了一种高效、实时的波束成形解决方案，在性能和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: We develop an unsupervised deep learning framework for downlink beamforming
in large-scale MU-MISO channels. The model is trained offline, allowing
real-time inference through lightweight feedforward computations in dynamic
communication environments. Following the learning-to-optimize (L2O) paradigm,
a multi-layer Transformer iteratively refines both channel and beamformer
features via residual connections. To enhance training, three strategies are
introduced: (i) curriculum learning (CL) to improve early-stage convergence and
avoid local optima, (ii) semi-amortized learning to refine each Transformer
block with a few gradient ascent steps, and (iii) sliding-window training to
stabilize optimization by training only a subset of Transformer blocks at a
time. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing
baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at
high SNRs, while achieving substantially faster inference than iterative and
online learning approaches.

TL;DR: DeepCausalMMM是一个结合深度学习、因果推理和营销科学的Python包，用于改进传统营销组合建模，能自动学习时间模式、渠道依赖关系和因果结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统营销组合建模方法存在局限性，如假设渠道间独立性、难以捕捉复杂时间动态和非线性饱和效应。

Method: 使用门控循环单元(GRU)学习时间模式，通过有向无环图(DAG)学习渠道间因果结构，采用Hill方程建模饱和曲线，并包含多区域建模、稳健统计方法和可视化工具。

Result: 该包实现了数据驱动的超参数学习、多区域建模、稳健统计方法、全面的响应曲线分析和交互式可视化仪表板。

Conclusion: DeepCausalMMM通过结合深度学习与因果推理，解决了传统营销组合建模的关键限制，提供了更准确和实用的营销效果评估工具。

Abstract: Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a statistical technique used to estimate the
impact of marketing activities on business outcomes such as sales, revenue, or
customer visits. Traditional MMM approaches often rely on linear regression or
Bayesian hierarchical models that assume independence between marketing
channels and struggle to capture complex temporal dynamics and non-linear
saturation effects [@Hanssens2005; @Ng2021Bayesian].
  DeepCausalMMM is a Python package that addresses these limitations by
combining deep learning, causal inference, and advanced marketing science. The
package uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to automatically learn temporal
patterns such as adstock (carryover effects) and lag, while simultaneously
learning statistical dependencies and potential causal structures between
marketing channels through Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) learning
[@Zheng2018NOTEARS; @Gong2024CausalMMM]. Additionally, it implements Hill
equation-based saturation curves to model diminishing returns and optimize
budget allocation.
  Key innovations include: (1) a data-driven design where hyperparameters and
transformations (e.g., adstock decay, saturation curves) are learned or
estimated from data with sensible defaults, rather than requiring fixed
heuristics or manual specification, (2) multi-region modeling with both shared
and region-specific parameters, (3) robust statistical methods including Huber
loss and advanced regularization, (4) comprehensive response curve analysis for
understanding channel saturation, and (5) an extensive visualization suite with
14+ interactive dashboards for business insights.

Conclusion: 提出的稀疏三角传输映射框架能够有效处理大晶格场理论的采样问题，在保持表达能力的同时实现计算效率的提升。

Abstract: Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics;
yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to
multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a
promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained
by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient
model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly
exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under
periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN).
We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that
navigates the fundamental trade-off between \emph{exact sparsity} (respecting
marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and
\emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins).
Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise
parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while
preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\phi^4$ in two
dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings)
affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against
Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to
traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them
efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to
their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what
types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do
this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of
thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision
log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact,
equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that
CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems
(including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than
CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster
reasoning.

Abstract: We study the client selection problem in Federated Learning (FL) within
mobile edge computing (MEC) environments, particularly under the dependent
multi-task settings, to reduce the total time required to complete various
learning tasks. We propose CoDa-FL, a Cluster-oriented and Dependency-aware
framework designed to reduce the total required time via cluster-based client
selection and dependent task assignment. Our approach considers Earth Mover's
Distance (EMD) for client clustering based on their local data distributions to
lower computational cost and improve communication efficiency. We derive a
direct and explicit relationship between intra-cluster EMD and the number of
training rounds required for convergence, thereby simplifying the otherwise
complex process of obtaining the optimal solution. Additionally, we incorporate
a directed acyclic graph-based task scheduling mechanism to effectively manage
task dependencies. Through numerical experiments, we validate that our proposed
CoDa-FL outperforms existing benchmarks by achieving faster convergence, lower
communication and computational costs, and higher learning accuracy under
heterogeneous MEC settings.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在分类和流匹配任务中表现出预期的收敛速率、正则化效果以及良好的运行时和内存性能。

Abstract: We study dropout regularization in continuous-time models through the lens of
random-batch methods -- a family of stochastic sampling schemes originally
devised to reduce the computational cost of interacting particle systems. We
construct an unbiased, well-posed estimator that mimics dropout by sampling
neuron batches over time intervals of length $h$. Trajectory-wise convergence
is established with linear rate in $h$ for the expected uniform error. At the
distribution level, we establish stability for the associated continuity
equation, with total-variation error of order $h^{1/2}$ under mild moment
assumptions. During training with fixed batch sampling across epochs, a
Pontryagin-based adjoint analysis bounds deviations in the optimal cost and
control, as well as in gradient-descent iterates. On the design side, we
compare convergence rates for canonical batch sampling schemes, recover
standard Bernoulli dropout as a special case, and derive a cost--accuracy
trade-off yielding a closed-form optimal $h$. We then specialize to a
single-layer neural ODE and validate the theory on classification and flow
matching, observing the predicted rates, regularization effects, and favorable
runtime and memory profiles.

Abstract: Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a
fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance
compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static
representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR),
are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program
will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic
representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights
into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks
due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends
this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program
representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization
sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation
generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization
sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To
effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a
compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize
the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words.
Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to
learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive
experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass
Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/PREP/.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant
success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the
universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the
network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among
different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented
body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high
computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we
present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete
equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete
equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete
scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and
2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an
efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two
common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model
demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few
layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining
strong practical efficacy.

Abstract: The rapid increase in multimodal data availability has sparked significant
interest in cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, where richer
"teacher" modalities transfer information to weaker "student" modalities during
model training to improve performance. However, despite successes across
various applications, cross-modal KD does not always result in improved
outcomes, primarily due to a limited theoretical understanding that could
inform practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Cross-modal
Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH): we propose that cross-modal KD is effective
when the mutual information between teacher and student representations exceeds
the mutual information between the student representation and the labels. We
theoretically validate the CCH in a joint Gaussian model and further confirm it
empirically across diverse multimodal datasets, including image, text, video,
audio, and cancer-related omics data. Our study establishes a novel theoretical
framework for understanding cross-modal KD and offers practical guidelines
based on the CCH criterion to select optimal teacher modalities for improving
the performance of weaker modalities.

Abstract: Healthcare fraud detection remains a critical challenge due to limited
availability of labeled data, constantly evolving fraud tactics, and the high

detect fraudulent prescription behaviors with improved accuracy and
interpretability. Our approach integrates structured domain expertise into a
neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples within a shared
embedding space. By training encoders jointly on synthetic data representing
both compliance and violation, CleverCatch learns soft rule embeddings that
generalize to complex, real-world datasets. This hybrid design enables
data-driven learning to be enhanced by domain-informed constraints, bridging
the gap between expert heuristics and machine learning. Experiments on the
large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that CleverCatch outperforms four
state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, yielding average improvements of
1.3\% in AUC and 3.4\% in recall. Our ablation study further highlights the
complementary role of expert rules, confirming the adaptability of the
framework. The results suggest that embedding expert rules into the learning
process not only improves detection accuracy but also increases transparency,
offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains such as healthcare
fraud detection.

### [69] [Performance Evaluation of Ising and QUBO Variable Encodings in Boltzmann Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13210)
*Yasushi Hasegawa,Masayuki Ohzeki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较Ising({-1,+1})和QUBO({0,1})编码在玻尔兹曼机学习中的性能差异，发现QUBO编码导致Fisher信息矩阵条件数更差，使随机梯度下降收敛更慢，而自然梯度下降对编码选择不敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同变量编码对玻尔兹曼机学习动态的影响，理解编码选择如何通过信息几何影响学习效率。

Method: 在控制模型、采样器和步长的协议下，比较Ising和QUBO编码，通过可视化经验矩和分析Fisher信息矩阵特征值分布来量化编码差异。

Result: QUBO编码在Fisher信息矩阵中产生更多小特征值方向，导致条件数更差，使随机梯度下降收敛更慢；自然梯度下降对编码选择具有重参数化不变性。

Conclusion: 对于基于SGD的训练，Ising编码提供更各向同性的曲率和更快收敛；对于QUBO编码，中心化/缩放或NGD式预处理可缓解曲率问题。这些结果为变量编码和预处理提供了实用指南。

Abstract: We compare Ising ({-1,+1}) and QUBO ({0,1}) encodings for Boltzmann machine
learning under a controlled protocol that fixes the model, sampler, and step
size. Exploiting the identity that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) equals
the covariance of sufficient statistics, we visualize empirical moments from
model samples and reveal systematic, representation-dependent differences. QUBO
induces larger cross terms between first- and second-order statistics, creating
more small-eigenvalue directions in the FIM and lowering spectral entropy. This
ill-conditioning explains slower convergence under stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). In contrast, natural gradient descent (NGD)-which rescales updates by
the FIM metric-achieves similar convergence across encodings due to
reparameterization invariance. Practically, for SGD-based training, the Ising
encoding provides more isotropic curvature and faster convergence; for QUBO,
centering/scaling or NGD-style preconditioning mitigates curvature pathologies.
These results clarify how representation shapes information geometry and
finite-time learning dynamics in Boltzmann machines and yield actionable
guidelines for variable encoding and preprocessing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的数据选择方法，通过截断影响函数评估偏好数据质量，发现数据质量是模型相关的，并开发了两种评分函数来改进偏好数据选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常使用外部奖励模型或现成LLM来预处理原始训练数据集以识别有价值的偏好对，但很少检查单个数据点是否真正有益。本文旨在通过个体影响评估数据质量。

Method: 提出截断影响函数来缓解传统度量中的过评分问题，并引入两种计算更简单的评分函数，这些函数与TIF正相关且模型相关，可作为偏好数据选择的潜在指标。

Result: 实验表明，使用更少的数据可以实现更好的对齐性能，证明了所提方法的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 偏好数据质量是模型相关的，一个数据对可能对一个模型有益但对另一个模型有害。通过结合评分函数来抵消不同的误差源，可以实现更精确的有价值偏好数据选择。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment is typically achieved through learning
from human preference comparisons, making the quality of preference data
critical to its success. Existing studies often pre-process raw training
datasets to identify valuable preference pairs using external reward models or
off-the-shelf LLMs, achieving improved overall performance but rarely examining
whether individual, selected data point is genuinely beneficial. We assess data
quality through individual influence on validation data using our newly
proposed truncated influence function (TIF), which mitigates the over-scoring
present in traditional measures and reveals that preference data quality is
inherently a property of the model. In other words, a data pair that benefits
one model may harm another. This leaves the need to improve the preference data
selection approaches to be adapting to specific models. To this end, we
introduce two candidate scoring functions (SFs) that are computationally
simpler than TIF and positively correlated with it. They are also model
dependent and can serve as potential indicators of individual data quality for
preference data selection. Furthermore, we observe that these SFs inherently
exhibit errors when compared to TIF. To this end, we combine them to offset
their diverse error sources, resulting in a simple yet effective data selection
rule that enables the models to achieve a more precise selection of valuable
preference data. We conduct experiments across diverse alignment benchmarks and
various LLM families, with results demonstrating that better alignment
performance can be achieved using less data, showing the generality of our
findings and new methods.

TL;DR: FracNet是一个基于频谱分析的图神经网络，通过分离高低频组件来解决图结构域适应问题，结合对比学习框架提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在域适应中难以处理结构分布偏移，未能区分全局和局部模式，导致局部细节在多层GNN后可能被破坏。

Method: 提出FracNet，包含两个协同模块：将原始图分解为高低频组件，进行频率感知的域适应，并集成对比学习框架解决模糊边界问题。

Result: 实验证明相比最先进方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 频谱分析能更好理解域偏移，FracNet通过频率分解和对比学习有效解决了图域适应问题，并有理论证明其优越性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various
domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant
structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable
patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do
not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details
in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that
domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where
low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and
high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we
propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware
\underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two
synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and
low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover,
the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating
with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we
also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of
FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: BlendFL是一个新颖的联邦学习框架，将横向和纵向联邦学习无缝结合，解决了多模态数据异构性问题，支持客户端根据本地数据情况灵活选择训练方式，并采用去中心化推理机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界中多模态数据异构性挑战，现有联邦学习框架在非理想设置下效果有限，无法处理客户端间模态和样本分布不均的情况。

Method: 提出BlendFL框架，同步融合横向和纵向联邦学习原则，支持客户端根据可用数据集灵活选择训练方式；引入去中心化推理机制和BlendAvg自适应全局模型聚合策略。

Result: 在三个分类任务上的实验表明，BlendFL在多模态和单模态分类中均优于现有方法，消融研究显示其收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: BlendFL在处理多模态数据异构性方面具有巨大潜力，特别适用于医疗和金融等需要数据隐私保护的现实场景。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of collaborative machine learning, without data
sharing, is multimodal data heterogeneity in real-world settings. While
Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across multiple clients,
existing frameworks, such as horizontal and vertical FL, are only effective in
`ideal' settings that meet specific assumptions. Hence, they struggle to
address scenarios where neither all modalities nor all samples are represented
across the participating clients. To address this gap, we propose BlendFL, a
novel FL framework that seamlessly blends the principles of horizontal and
vertical FL in a synchronized and non-restrictive fashion despite the asymmetry
across clients. Specifically, any client within BlendFL can benefit from either
of the approaches, or both simultaneously, according to its available dataset.
In addition, BlendFL features a decentralized inference mechanism, empowering
clients to run collaboratively trained local models using available local data,
thereby reducing latency and reliance on central servers for inference. We also
introduce BlendAvg, an adaptive global model aggregation strategy that
prioritizes collaborative model updates based on each client's performance. We
trained and evaluated BlendFL and other state-of-the-art baselines on three
classification tasks using a large-scale real-world multimodal medical dataset
and a popular multimodal benchmark. Our results highlight BlendFL's superior
performance for both multimodal and unimodal classification. Ablation studies
demonstrate BlendFL's faster convergence compared to traditional approaches,
accelerating collaborative learning. Overall, in our study we highlight the
potential of BlendFL for handling multimodal data heterogeneity for
collaborative learning in real-world settings where data privacy is crucial,
such as in healthcare and finance.

TL;DR: MERA是一个通过选择性、自适应干预来减少语言模型错误的框架，优化干预方向和校准干预时机与强度，避免过度或不足干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定、手动调整的干预强度，往往导致干预不足或过度，MERA旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 通过优化干预方向和校准干预时机与强度，在无法自信修正时选择弃权，可证明地提升性能。

Result: 在多个数据集和语言模型家族上的实验表明，MERA能安全、有效地进行错误修正且不降低性能，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MERA可作为现有干预技术的通用增强方法，是一种高效、通用的机制激活干预方法。

Abstract: We introduce Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention (MERA), a principled
framework for steering language models (LMs) to mitigate errors through
selective, adaptive interventions. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed,
manually tuned steering strengths, often resulting in under or oversteering,
MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction,
and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving
performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments
across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective,
non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines.
Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further
enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient
approach to mechanistic activation steering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Fed-CCP方法，通过生成模型实现联邦条件保形预测，解决联邦学习中数据分布异质性导致的覆盖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准保形预测假设数据独立同分布，但在联邦学习场景中，客户端数据分布差异显著，现有方法只能保证边际覆盖，无法反映输入条件不确定性。

Method: 利用生成模型（如归一化流或扩散模型）近似条件数据分布，无需共享原始数据，客户端本地校准反映其独特不确定性的保形分数，通过联邦聚合保持全局一致性。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，Fed-CCP实现了更自适应的预测集。

Conclusion: Fed-CCP通过生成模型有效解决了联邦学习中的条件覆盖问题，为高风险应用提供了更可靠的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) provides distribution-free uncertainty
quantification by constructing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the
true labels. This reliability makes CP valuable for high-stakes federated
learning scenarios such as multi-center healthcare. However, standard CP
assumes i.i.d. data, which is violated in federated settings where client
distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods address this
by maintaining marginal coverage on each client, but such guarantees often fail
to reflect input-conditional uncertainty. In this work, we propose Federated
Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) via generative models, which aims
for conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity. Fed-CCP
leverages generative models, such as normalizing flows or diffusion models, to
approximate conditional data distributions without requiring the sharing of raw
data. This enables each client to locally calibrate conformal scores that
reflect its unique uncertainty, while preserving global consistency through
federated aggregation. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that Fed-CCP
achieves more adaptive prediction sets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合生成扩散模型和保形预测框架的动态降尺度方法，通过后处理扩散模型的样本来获得条件分位数估计，从而提供具有有限样本边际有效性的局部自适应预测区间，显著改善了网格点级别的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成扩散模型在动态降尺度任务中虽然能够提供高保真度的重建和可扩展的采样，但缺乏对过度自信预测的有限样本保证，导致网格点级别的不确定性估计校准不佳，影响了在操作环境中的可靠性。

Method: 通过将扩散模型的样本进行后处理来推导条件分位数估计，并将其纳入保形化分位数回归过程，目标是获得具有有限样本边际有效性的局部自适应预测区间。

Result: 在意大利ERA5再分析数据上的评估结果显示，相对于扩散模型基线，该方法显著改善了网格点级别的不确定性估计的覆盖率和稳定了概率评分。

Conclusion: 保形化生成模型在实现更可信的高分辨率气象场概率降尺度方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological
fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical
applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling.
Generative Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven
tools for this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable
sampling supporting uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample
guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated
grid-point-level uncertainty estimates hindering their reliability in
operational contexts. In this work, we tackle this issue by augmenting the
downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework. Specifically, the
DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional quantile estimates,
incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure targeting
locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity. The
proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled
to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with
markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM
baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for
more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological
fields.

Result: 在22个真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ISER在11个基线方法中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: ISER通过使用超球体半径作为局部密度代理，有效解决了现有异常检测方法的局限性，并在多个数据集上取得了更好的性能。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in data mining and management with
applications spanning fraud detection, network security, and log monitoring.
Despite extensive research, existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods
still face fundamental challenges including conflicting distributional
assumptions, computational inefficiency, and difficulty handling different
anomaly types. To address these problems, we propose ISER (Isolation-based
Spherical Ensemble Representations) that extends existing isolation-based
methods by using hypersphere radii as proxies for local density characteristics
while maintaining linear time and constant space complexity. ISER constructs
ensemble representations where hypersphere radii encode density information:
smaller radii indicate dense regions while larger radii correspond to sparse
areas. We introduce a novel similarity-based scoring method that measures
pattern consistency by comparing ensemble representations against a theoretical
anomaly reference pattern. Additionally, we enhance the performance of
Isolation Forest by using ISER and adapting the scoring function to address
axis-parallel bias and local anomaly detection limitations. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 real-world datasets demonstrate ISER's superior performance
over 11 baseline methods.

TL;DR: RockNet是一种专为超低功耗硬件设计的TinyML方法，通过分布式学习和无线通信集成，在时间序列分类任务中实现最先进精度，无需离线预训练。


<details>

Motivation: 随着机器学习在信息物理系统中的普及，由于隐私和延迟问题，需要将训练从云端转移到设备端。但超低功耗微控制器的有限计算资源使训练变得困难。

Method: 利用CPS由多个设备组成的特点，设计分布式学习方法，集成机器学习和无线通信。使用专门的、计算高效的分类器进行分布式训练，最小化通信开销，并结合定制的无线多跳通信协议。

Result: 在20个超低功耗设备的测试平台上，RockNet成功从零开始学习时间序列分类任务，比最新的神经网络微控制器训练方法精度提高达2倍。分布式架构在从1个中心设备扩展到20个设备时，每个设备的内存、延迟和能耗降低达90%。

Conclusion: 分布式机器学习、分布式计算和通信的紧密集成首次实现了在超低功耗硬件上以最先进精度进行训练。

Abstract: As Machine Learning (ML) becomes integral to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS),
there is growing interest in shifting training from traditional cloud-based to
on-device processing (TinyML), for example, due to privacy and latency
concerns. However, CPS often comprise ultra-low-power microcontrollers, whose
limited compute resources make training challenging. This paper presents
RockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault
or malware detection, without requiring offline pretraining. By leveraging that
CPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that
integrates ML and wireless communication. RockNet leverages all devices for
distributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need
minimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and
efficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes
the communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning.
Hardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate
RockNet's effectiveness. It successfully learns timeseries classification tasks
from scratch, surpassing the accuracy of the latest approach for neural network
microcontroller training by up to 2x. RockNet's distributed ML architecture
reduces memory, latency and energy consumption per device by up to 90 % when
scaling from one central device to 20 devices. Our results show that a tight
integration of distributed ML, distributed computing, and communication
enables, for the first time, training on ultra-low-power hardware with
state-of-the-art accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在战略性分类中引入弃权机制的影响，证明弃权不仅能提高分类器准确性，还能作为操纵行为的威慑手段，特别是在操纵成本足够高的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法决策系统容易受到战略性操纵，而先前研究表明分类器弃权能显著提高准确性。本文旨在探索在战略性分类环境中引入弃权机制如何影响战略代理的响应，以及主体应如何最优地利用弃权。

Method: 采用Stackelberg博弈模型，主体作为分类器首先宣布决策策略，然后战略代理作为跟随者操纵其特征以获得期望结果。研究聚焦于二元分类器，代理操纵可观察特征而非真实特征。

Result: 最优弃权确保主体的效用（或损失）不会比非弃权设置更差，即使在存在战略代理的情况下。弃权不仅能提高准确性，还能作为操纵威慑，使代理（尤其是资质较差的代理）在操纵成本足够高时更难通过操纵获得积极结果。

Conclusion: 弃权是减少算法决策系统中战略性行为负面效应的有价值工具，既能提高准确性，又能增加操纵成本，从而抑制操纵行为。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision making is increasingly prevalent, but often vulnerable
to strategic manipulation by agents seeking a favorable outcome. Prior research
has shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a
decision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier
accuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification
context, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and
how principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a
Stackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces
its decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate
their features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary
classifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true
features, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility
(or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of
strategic agents. We also show that beyond improving accuracy, abstention can
also serve as a deterrent to manipulation, making it costlier for agents,
especially those less qualified, to manipulate to achieve a positive outcome
when manipulation costs are significant enough to affect agent behavior. These
results highlight abstention as a valuable tool for reducing the negative
effects of strategic behavior in algorithmic decision making systems.

Conclusion: ToSFiT方法通过精心适应最大概率的后验分布，在离散优化任务中实现了高效的Thompson采样，理论分析证明了其与标准Thompson采样相当的遗憾界保证。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered
by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the
absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson
sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by
directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum
reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the
prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and
incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a
novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that
matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals
the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of
maximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we
validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally
stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. We demonstrate that online
fine-tuning significantly improves sample efficiency, with negligible impact on
computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 邻近核方法能够有效处理不完整数据，在保持计算效率的同时提供更准确的相似性度量。

Abstract: Measuring similarity between incomplete data is a fundamental challenge in
web mining, recommendation systems, and user behavior analysis. Traditional
approaches either discard incomplete data or perform imputation as a
preprocessing step, leading to information loss and biased similarity
estimates. This paper presents the proximity kernel, a new similarity measure
that directly computes similarity between incomplete data in kernel feature
space without explicit imputation in the original space. The proposed method
introduces data-dependent binning combined with proximity assignment to project
data into a high-dimensional sparse representation that adapts to local density
variations. For missing value handling, we propose a cascading fallback
strategy to estimate missing feature distributions. We conduct clustering tasks
on the proposed kernel representation across 12 real world incomplete datasets,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods while
maintaining linear time complexity. All the code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练存在两个主要局限：自然精度显著下降，以及在不同范数约束攻击下的鲁棒性迁移能力差。现有方法通常只在一个网络中解决单个问题。

Method: 将整体泛化目标分解为多个子任务，每个基础学习器专注于特定目标成为专家。在训练后期插值参数形成全局学习器，并定期将全局参数重新分配给基础学习器防止优化轨迹偏离。

Result: 理论分析和大量实验表明，Generalist实现了更低的泛化误差，显著缓解了基线方法中的权衡问题。

Conclusion: Generalist为开发完全鲁棒的分类器提供了有前景的一步，能够有效解决对抗训练中的自然精度与鲁棒性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable
to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the
most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical
applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade
significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer
well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior
works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we
propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks,
each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated
objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the
later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a
knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global
parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories
from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist
and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist
achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off

TL;DR: 该论文研究表明，通过适当的架构和训练策略，transformer可以在在线无模型强化学习中成为连续控制任务的强基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管transformer在离线或基于模型的强化学习中表现出色，但在在线无模型强化学习中仍未被充分探索，主要因为其对训练设置和模型设计决策的敏感性。

Method: 研究了关键设计问题：如何条件化输入、在actor和critic之间共享组件，以及如何切片序列数据进行训练。通过实验探索了稳定的架构和训练策略。

Result: 实验表明，这些策略能够在完全可观测和部分可观测任务中，以及在向量和图像设置下实现有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为在在线强化学习中应用transformer提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Despite their effectiveness and popularity in offline or model-based
reinforcement learning (RL), transformers remain underexplored in online
model-free RL due to their sensitivity to training setups and model design
decisions such as how to structure the policy and value networks, share
components, or handle temporal information. In this paper, we show that
transformers can be strong baselines for continuous control in online
model-free RL. We investigate key design questions: how to condition inputs,
share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for
training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies
enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks,
and in both vector- and image-based settings. These findings offer practical
guidance for applying transformers in online RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种结合对比学习的依赖建模和异常检测方法，通过构建依赖图、提取时空特征、使用图卷积聚合邻域信息，并引入对比学习框架增强正常与异常模式的可分性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决云服务环境中复杂依赖关系和多样化异常模式的挑战，传统方法难以有效处理这些复杂场景。

Method: 将服务交互抽象为依赖图，通过嵌入函数提取时空特征，使用图卷积机制聚合邻域信息，引入对比学习框架构建正负样本对，并设计时间一致性约束保持表示稳定性。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在精确率、召回率、F1分数和AUC等关键指标上显著优于现有方法，在稀疏标注、监控噪声和流量波动条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 验证了依赖建模与对比学习结合的有效性，为云服务异常检测提供了完整技术方案，在复杂环境中表现出强大的适应性和稳定性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse
anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency
modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The
method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts
temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a
graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for
context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then
introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the
separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space.
Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain
representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term
fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and
temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across
multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically
evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity
perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC,
while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring
noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of
integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides a complete
technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability in complex environments.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管数据可用性和准确预测需求增加，但利益相关者之间的协作常受数据所有权和竞争利益限制，需要更通用的协作框架。

Method: 使用预测市场机制，结合稳健回归模型学习最优预测组合，处理缺失提交，并引入考虑样本内外表现的收益分配机制。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界数据的案例研究中证明了所提出市场设计的有效性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该预测市场设计能够有效促进利益相关者协作，满足多个期望的经济特性，并适应动态变化的环境。

Abstract: Although both data availability and the demand for accurate forecasts are
increasing, collaboration between stakeholders is often constrained by data
ownership and competitive interests. In contrast to recent proposals within
cooperative game-theoretical frameworks, we place ourselves in a more general
framework, based on prediction markets. There, independent agents trade
forecasts of uncertain future events in exchange for rewards. We introduce and
analyse a prediction market that (i) accounts for the historical performance of
the agents, (ii) adapts to time-varying conditions, while (iii) permitting
agents to enter and exit the market at will. The proposed design employs robust
regression models to learn the optimal forecasts' combination whilst handling
missing submissions. Moreover, we introduce a pay-off allocation mechanism that
considers both in-sample and out-of-sample performance while satisfying several
desirable economic properties. Case-studies using simulated and real-world data
allow demonstrating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed market
design.

*Benjamin Kempinski,Tal Kachman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络的方法来近似计算网络流博弈中的Banzhaf值，相比传统方法实现了数量级的速度提升，并展示了强大的零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法计算Banzhaf值在超过约20个代理时变得不可行，蒙特卡洛采样方法样本复杂度高且无法在不同网络配置间迁移知识，难以适用于大规模或动态系统。

Method: 将问题构建为图级预测任务，使用图神经网络直接从网络拓扑和控制结构中学习代理影响力的通用模式。比较了三种最先进的GNN架构：GAT、GINE和EdgeConv。

Result: 训练后的GNN模型实现了高保真度的Banzhaf值近似，相比精确和基于采样的方法实现了数量级的速度提升，并展示了强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了GNN作为复杂网络系统可扩展合作博弈论分析的实用工具。

Abstract: Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for
quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging
from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is
intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential
complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide
statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot
transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them
impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel
learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate
Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a
graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent
influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a
comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN
architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with
Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of
200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count
(5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained
GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with
order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most
significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on
graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for
entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring
retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable
cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个假设宽松的框架，用于评估生存分析中条件平均治疗效应(CATE)估计在存在删失偏差时的稳健性，通过部分识别方法获得CATE的有信息边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床研究中高达一半的患者因副作用或其他原因提前退出，当退出是信息性时（即依赖于生存时间），会引入删失偏差，导致治疗效应估计产生偏差。

Method: 使用部分识别方法推导CATE的有信息边界，开发一种新的元学习器，利用任意机器学习模型估计边界，具有双重稳健性和准oracle效率的理论特性。

Result: 数值实验和癌症药物试验应用表明，该框架能够识别在信息性删失情况下治疗仍然有效的患者亚组。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估存在删失时估计治疗效应的稳健性提供了实用工具，促进了生存数据在医学和流行病学中证据生成的可靠使用。

Abstract: Dropout is common in clinical studies, with up to half of patients leaving
early due to side effects or other reasons. When dropout is informative (i.e.,
dependent on survival time), it introduces censoring bias, because of which
treatment effect estimates are also biased. In this paper, we propose an
assumption-lean framework to assess the robustness of conditional average
treatment effect (CATE) estimates in survival analysis when facing censoring
bias. Unlike existing works that rely on strong assumptions, such as
non-informative censoring, to obtain point estimation, we use partial
identification to derive informative bounds on the CATE. Thereby, our framework
helps to identify patient subgroups where treatment is effective despite
informative censoring. We further develop a novel meta-learner that estimates
the bounds using arbitrary machine learning models and with favorable
theoretical properties, including double robustness and quasi-oracle
efficiency. We demonstrate the practical value of our meta-learner through
numerical experiments and in an application to a cancer drug trial. Together,
our framework offers a practical tool for assessing the robustness of estimated
treatment effects in the presence of censoring and thus promotes the reliable
use of survival data for evidence generation in medicine and epidemiology.

Motivation: 传统RGB和热红外融合在恶劣能见度条件下难以提供全面的场景信息，而SWIR成像虽能穿透大气干扰但缺乏公开数据集，因此需要开发合成SWIR的方法来克服数据稀缺问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为恶劣能见度条件下的场景理解提供了有效解决方案，在监控和自动驾驶系统等实际应用中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Enhancing scene understanding in adverse visibility conditions remains a
critical challenge for surveillance and autonomous navigation systems.
Conventional imaging modalities, such as RGB and thermal infrared (MWIR /
LWIR), when fused, often struggle to deliver comprehensive scene information,
particularly under conditions of atmospheric interference or inadequate
illumination. To address these limitations, Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging
has emerged as a promising modality due to its ability to penetrate atmospheric
disturbances and differentiate materials with improved clarity. However, the
advancement and widespread implementation of SWIR-based systems face
significant hurdles, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible SWIR
datasets. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to
synthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming
spectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast
enhancement techniques. We then propose a multimodal fusion framework
integrating synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities, employing an optimized
encoder-decoder neural network architecture with modality-specific encoders and
a softmax-gated fusion head. Comprehensive experiments on public {RGB-LWIR
benchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and an additional private real
RGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset} demonstrate that our synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion
framework improves fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural
fidelity) while maintaining real-time performance. We also add fair trimodal
baselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded trimodal variants of
U2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. The outcomes highlight
substantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and
autonomous systems.

Motivation: 解决相似数据训练的嵌入模型之间缺乏互操作性的问题，这在模型重训练、部分模型升级和多模态搜索等应用中带来挑战。

Method: 使用Procrustes后处理方法，通过正交变换对齐两个嵌入集合，保持每个嵌入空间的几何结构。

Result: 在三个应用中验证了方法的有效性：跨重训练的兼容性维护、不同文本检索模型的组合、以及混合模态搜索的改进，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过正交变换可以有效地使嵌入模型具有互操作性，Procrustes后处理是一个简单而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Embedding models trained separately on similar data often produce
representations that encode stable information but are not directly
interchangeable. This lack of interoperability raises challenges in several
practical applications, such as model retraining, partial model upgrades, and
multimodal search. Driven by these challenges, we study when two sets of
embeddings can be aligned by an orthogonal transformation. We show that if
pairwise dot products are approximately preserved, then there exists an
isometry that closely aligns the two sets, and we provide a tight bound on the
alignment error. This insight yields a simple alignment recipe, Procrustes
post-processing, that makes two embedding models interoperable while preserving
the geometry of each embedding space. Empirically, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in three applications: maintaining compatibility across
retrainings, combining different models for text retrieval, and improving
mixed-modality search, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 在肿瘤学中，实验数据通常稀疏且仅包含少数时间点的肿瘤体积数据，需要开发能够在有限数据条件下学习复杂动态系统的方法。

Method: 扩展物理信息神经网络，将观察到的生物约束作为正则化项嵌入损失函数，结合先验知识作为归纳偏置来引导学习过程。

Conclusion: 改进的PINN框架在肿瘤学应用中表现出色，通过嵌入生物约束作为正则化项，能够在稀疏数据条件下有效学习复杂动态系统。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are neural networks that embed the
laws of dynamical systems modeled by differential equations into their loss
function as constraints. In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to
oncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination
therapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often
sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding
inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we
extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed
biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is
able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only
a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning
the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution
to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We
demonstrate a strong convergence using metrics such as the mean squared error
(MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

Conclusion: 这种混合方法为预测建模提供了一个平衡且多功能的工具，解决了模糊系统中可解释性和准确性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Regression analysis is employed to examine and quantify the relationships
between input variables and a dependent and continuous output variable. It is
widely used for predictive modelling in fields such as finance, healthcare, and
engineering. However, traditional methods often struggle with real-world data
complexities, including uncertainty and ambiguity. While deep learning
approaches excel at capturing complex non-linear relationships, they lack
interpretability and risk over-fitting on small datasets. Fuzzy systems provide
an alternative framework for handling uncertainty and imprecision, with Mamdani
and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) systems offering complementary strengths:
interpretability versus accuracy. This paper presents a novel fuzzy regression
method that combines the interpretability of Mamdani systems with the precision
of TSK models. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid rule structure with
fuzzy and crisp components and dual dominance types, enhancing both accuracy
and explainability. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance in several cases, with rules maintaining a
component similar to traditional Mamdani systems while improving precision
through improved rule outputs. This hybrid methodology offers a balanced and
versatile tool for predictive modelling, addressing the trade-off between
interpretability and accuracy inherent in fuzzy systems. In the 6 datasets
tested, the proposed approach gave the best fuzzy methodology score in 4
datasets, out-performed the opaque models in 2 datasets and produced the best
overall score in 1 dataset with the improvements in RMSE ranging from 0.4% to
19%.

Motivation: 停车位的准确GPS位置对停车管理、政策和城市发展至关重要，但高层建筑会导致GPS点漂移，且低成本GPS设备本身存在位置误差，需要无监督地校正大量停车位中的错误GPS点。

Conclusion: 提出的非常规校正和对齐方法简单而有效，能够解决停车位GPS点定位的实际问题。

Abstract: Parking spots are essential components, providing vital mobile resources for
residents in a city. Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking
spots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management,
parking policy, and urban development. However, high-rise buildings tend to
cause GPS points to drift from the actual locations of parking spots; besides,
the standard lower-cost GPS equipment itself has a certain location error.
Therefore, it is a non-trivial task to correct a few wrong GPS points from a
large number of parking spots in an unsupervised approach. In this paper,
motivated by the physical constraints of parking spots (i.e., parking spots are
parallel to the sides of roads), we propose an unsupervised low-rank method to
effectively rectify errors in GPS points and further align them to the parking
spots in a unified framework. The proposed unconventional rectification and
alignment method is simple and yet effective for any type of GPS point errors.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to
solve a practical problem. The data set and the code are publicly accessible

Conclusion: 该方法为SOS编程的实际可扩展性提供了新的见解和突破。

Abstract: Certifying nonnegativity of polynomials is a well-known NP-hard problem with
direct applications spanning non-convex optimization, control, robotics, and
beyond. A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS)
property, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In
practice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally
expensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose
dimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS
expression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis
have been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented
algorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer
model that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial,
thereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall
methodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset
generation of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the
corresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to
ensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically. We validate our
approach on over 200 benchmark datasets, achieving speedups of over $100\times$
compared to state-of-the-art solvers and enabling the solution of instances
where competing approaches fail. Our findings provide novel insights towards
transforming the practical scalability of SOS programming.

Method: 基于优化误差、正则化强度和Rademacher复杂度建立平滑校准误差的有限样本泛化界，并在再生核希尔伯特空间中实例化该理论，为核岭回归和逻辑回归提供具体保证。

Result: 实验证实了这些具体保证，表明L2正则化ERM可以在不使用boosting或后处理重新校准的情况下提供良好校准的模型。

Conclusion: 标准L2正则化经验风险最小化本身就具有控制模型校准的能力，无需额外的校准技术。

Abstract: Calibration of predicted probabilities is critical for reliable machine
learning, yet it is poorly understood how standard training procedures yield
well-calibrated models. This work provides the first theoretical proof that
canonical $L_{2}$-regularized empirical risk minimization directly controls the
smooth calibration error (smCE) without post-hoc correction or specialized
calibration-promoting regularizer. We establish finite-sample generalization
bounds for smCE based on optimization error, regularization strength, and the
Rademacher complexity. We then instantiate this theory for models in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, deriving concrete guarantees for kernel
ridge and logistic regression. Our experiments confirm these specific
guarantees, demonstrating that $L_{2}$-regularized ERM can provide a
well-calibrated model without boosting or post-hoc recalibration. The source
code to reproduce all experiments is available at

Conclusion: 提出的学习算法结合停止规则能在可能的情况下实现有限时间策略识别，为偏差最优性层次结构提供了实用的识别方法。

Abstract: Although average gain optimality is a commonly adopted performance measure in
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), it is often too asymptotic. Further
incorporating measures of immediate losses leads to the hierarchy of bias
optimalities, all the way up to Blackwell optimality. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of identifying policies of such optimality orders. To
that end, for each order, we construct a learning algorithm with vanishing
probability of error. Furthermore, we characterize the class of MDPs for which
identification algorithms can stop in finite time. That class corresponds to
the MDPs with a unique Bellman optimal policy, and does not depend on the
optimality order considered. Lastly, we provide a tractable stopping rule that
when coupled to our learning algorithm triggers in finite time whenever it is
possible to do so.

TL;DR: 提出基于CLIP框架的多模态癫痫检测模型DistilCLIP-EEG，整合EEG信号和文本描述，通过知识蒸馏训练轻量级学生模型，在多个数据集上准确率超过97%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有癫痫检测方法仅依赖单模态EEG信号，忽略了多模态信息的潜在优势，需要开发能整合多种信息的更全面检测方法。

Method: 使用Conformer架构的EEG编码器和可学习BERT作为文本编码器，在共享潜在空间进行跨模态表示学习，并通过知识蒸馏训练更紧凑的学生模型。

Result: 在TUSZ、AUBMC和CHB-MIT数据集上，教师和学生模型准确率均超过97%，F1分数稳定高于0.94，学生模型参数量和大小约为教师模型的58.1%。

Conclusion: 该模型在EEG癫痫检测中表现出色，为资源受限环境部署轻量级模型奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder marked by sudden, brief
episodes of excessive neuronal activity caused by abnormal electrical
discharges, which may lead to some mental disorders. Most existing deep
learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals,
neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this,
we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP
framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture
comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder
based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable
BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared
latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance
efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where
the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student
model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT
datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding
97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94,
demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework.
Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately
58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity
and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results
highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection
and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in
resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used
objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$
local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human
preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the
principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under
single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a
matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.
  In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the
problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm
and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log
(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time
step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space
$\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF.
As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for
online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the
offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source
code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备存储有限，LoRA通常以增量方式交付，需要在线持续合并新LoRA同时保持对先前任务的支持性能。

Method: 采用数据无关且计算高效的策略来选择合并LoRA，假设设备只能存储有限数量的适配器。

Result: 在真实世界任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在遵守设备存储预算和计算限制的同时优于其他策略。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了设备上在线持续合并LoRA的挑战，在资源受限环境下保持多任务性能。

Abstract: On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages
Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight
resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile
devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple
LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered
incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem
types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online
continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while
preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we
propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and
merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store
only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world
tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative
strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of
on-device settings.

TL;DR: ProtoTopic是一种基于原型网络的医学论文主题模型，在数据有限的情况下比传统主题建模方法表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题建模技术在医学文本上表现不佳，特别是当某些医疗主题的文档数量较少时。

Method: 使用原型网络构建主题模型，通过计算输入数据点与原型表示之间的距离来进行预测，特别适用于低数据或小样本学习场景。

Result: 与文献中使用的两种主题建模基线相比，ProtoTopic显示出更好的主题连贯性和多样性。

Conclusion: 该模型能够在数据有限的情况下生成医学相关主题，证明了原型网络在医学主题建模中的有效性。

Abstract: Topic modeling is a useful tool for analyzing large corpora of written
documents, particularly academic papers. Despite a wide variety of proposed
topic modeling techniques, these techniques do not perform well when applied to
medical texts. This can be due to the low number of documents available for
some topics in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we propose ProtoTopic, a
prototypical network-based topic model used for topic generation for a set of
medical paper abstracts. Prototypical networks are efficient, explainable
models that make predictions by computing distances between input datapoints
and a set of prototype representations, making them particularly effective in
low-data or few-shot learning scenarios. With ProtoTopic, we demonstrate
improved topic coherence and diversity compared to two topic modeling baselines
used in the literature, demonstrating the ability of our model to generate
medically relevant topics even with limited data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展传统在线凸优化(OCO)框架，考虑多个损失函数序列同时存在的情况，研究如何在不知道未来信息的情况下平衡追踪多个序列的性能。

Method: 提出结合Hedge算法和在线梯度下降(OGD)的简单算法，在i.i.d.输入设置下处理多目标优化问题。

Result: 通过简洁的证明，表明该算法的期望最小最大遗憾为O(√(T log K))。

Conclusion: 该算法能有效处理多目标在线凸优化问题，在i.i.d.设置下实现了接近最优的性能保证。

Abstract: In online convex optimization (OCO), a single loss function sequence is
revealed over a time horizon of $T$, and an online algorithm has to choose its
action at time $t$, before the loss function at time $t$ is revealed. The goal
of the online algorithm is to incur minimal penalty (called $\textit{regret}$
compared to a static optimal action made by an optimal offline algorithm
knowing all functions of the sequence in advance.
  In this paper, we broaden the horizon of OCO, and consider multi-objective
OCO, where there are $K$ distinct loss function sequences, and an algorithm has
to choose its action at time $t$, before the $K$ loss functions at time $t$ are
revealed. To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences,
we consider the $\textit{min-max}$ regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline
algorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the
maximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the
$K$ sequences. An online algorithm is allowed to change its action across time
slots, and its {\it min-max} regret is defined as the difference between its
$\textit{min-max}$ cost and that of the benchmark. The $\textit{min-max}$
regret is a stringent performance measure and an algorithm with small regret
needs to `track' all loss function sequences closely at all times.
  We consider this $\textit{min-max}$ regret in the i.i.d. input setting where
all loss functions are i.i.d. generated from an unknown distribution. For the
i.i.d. model we propose a simple algorithm that combines the well-known
$\textit{Hedge}$ and online gradient descent (OGD) and show via a remarkably
simple proof that its expected $\textit{min-max}$ regret is $O(\sqrt{T \log
K})$.

TL;DR: 提出DOLFIN方法，结合Vision Transformers和低秩适配器，在联邦持续学习中高效稳定地学习新任务，同时防止遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦持续学习需要在多个分布式客户端上学习新任务，同时保护隐私且不忘记先前知识，但现有方法在性能、隐私保护和通信效率之间难以平衡。

Method: 使用低秩适配器(LoRA)减少通信开销，并引入DualGradient Projection Memory(DualGPM)来防止遗忘，在Vision Transformers上实现分布式在线学习。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、ImageNet-R、ImageNet-A和CUB-200数据集上的评估显示，DOLFIN在最终平均准确率上持续超越六个强基线方法，同时保持相同的内存占用。

Conclusion: 正交低秩适配器为联邦环境中的隐私保护持续学习提供了有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables models to learn new tasks across
multiple distributed clients, protecting privacy and without forgetting
previously acquired knowledge. However, current methods face challenges
balancing performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency. We
introduce a Distributed Online LoRA for Federated INcremental learning method
DOLFIN, a novel approach combining Vision Transformers with low-rank adapters
designed to efficiently and stably learn new tasks in federated environments.
Our method leverages LoRA for minimal communication overhead and incorporates
DualGradient Projection Memory (DualGPM) to prevent forgetting. Evaluated on
CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB-200 under two Dirichlet
heterogeneity settings, DOLFIN consistently surpasses six strong baselines in
final average accuracy while matching their memory footprint. Orthogonal
low-rank adapters offer an effective and scalable solution for
privacy-preserving continual learning in federated settings.

TL;DR: 本文研究了选择性对抗攻击对LLM基准测试的影响，发现即使微小的文本扰动也能显著改变模型在MMLU基准上的相对排名，挑战了排行榜评估的公平性和可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试容易受到语义等效的对抗扰动影响，但现有研究主要关注对所有模型产生同等影响的攻击，缺乏对选择性攻击（即仅针对特定模型性能）的研究。

Method: 使用TextAttack框架中的标准攻击方法，开发了选择性评估协议、定制约束条件以提高攻击选择性，并提出了基于代理LLM的选择性扰动生成流程。

Result: 实验证明选择性对抗攻击确实存在，并且能够实质性改变模型在MMLU基准上的相对排名，影响评估的公平性和透明度。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在LLM评估中需要采用扰动感知的报告机制和鲁棒性诊断，即使是细微的文本编辑也能改变比较判断。

Abstract: Benchmarking outcomes increasingly govern trust, selection, and deployment of
LLMs, yet these evaluations remain vulnerable to semantically equivalent
adversarial perturbations. Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has
emphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the
question of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance
performance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem
and study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark
designed to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning
ability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into
TextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment,
develop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a
surrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we
find that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative
rankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of
leaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware
reporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that
even subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先进节点中功率、性能和面积(PPA)优化变得高度复杂，机器学习和设计技术协同优化面临训练数据不足和设计流程周转时间长的限制。

Method: 提出ArtNet人工网表生成器，复制关键拓扑特征，生成更匹配目标参数的逼真人工数据集。

Result: 在CNN基DRV预测中，ArtNet数据增强使F1分数提高0.16；在DTCO中，生成的小型脑设计PPA匹配度达97.94%，与目标全规模块设计指标高度一致。

Conclusion: ArtNet通过生成逼真的人工数据集，有效解决了ML和DTCO中的数据稀缺问题，显著提升了PPA优化效率。

Abstract: In advanced nodes, optimization of power, performance and area (PPA) has
become highly complex and challenging. Machine learning (ML) and
design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) provide promising mitigations, but
face limitations due to a lack of diverse training data as well as long design
flow turnaround times (TAT). We propose ArtNet, a novel artificial netlist
generator designed to tackle these issues. Unlike previous methods, ArtNet
replicates key topological characteristics, enhancing ML model generalization
and supporting broader design space exploration for DTCO. By producing
realistic artificial datasets that moreclosely match given target parameters,
ArtNet enables more efficient PPAoptimization and exploration of flows and
design enablements. In the context of CNN-based DRV prediction, ArtNet's data
augmentationimproves F1 score by 0.16 compared to using only the original
(real) dataset. In the DTCO context, ArtNet-generated mini-brains achieve a PPA
match up to 97.94%, demonstrating close alignment with design metrics of
targeted full-scale block designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEEG信号分析在脑机接口和神经科学研究中很重要，但由于输入通道数量大且相关性异质，传统通道选择方法难以扩展或提供有意义的可解释性。

Method: EEGChaT引入通道聚合令牌(CATs)来聚合跨通道信息，并利用改进的注意力展开技术计算可解释的定量通道重要性分数。

Result: 在DuIN数据集上的评估表明，将EEGChaT与现有分类模型集成可显著提高解码准确率，绝对增益高达17%，且产生的通道权重与手动选择的通道有显著重叠。

Conclusion: EEGChaT是高维SEEG分析中有效且可泛化的通道选择解决方案，既提高了性能又提供了对神经信号相关性的洞察。

Abstract: Analyzing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals is critical for
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and neuroscience research, yet
poses significant challenges due to the large number of input channels and
their heterogeneous relevance. Traditional channel selection methods struggle
to scale or provide meaningful interpretability for SEEG data. In this work, we
propose EEGChaT, a novel Transformer-based channel selection module designed to
automatically identify the most task-relevant channels in SEEG recordings.
EEGChaT introduces Channel Aggregation Tokens (CATs) to aggregate information
across channels, and leverages an improved Attention Rollout technique to
compute interpretable, quantitative channel importance scores. We evaluate
EEGChaT on the DuIN dataset, demonstrating that integrating EEGChaT with
existing classification models consistently improves decoding accuracy,
achieving up to 17\% absolute gains. Furthermore, the channel weights produced
by EEGChaT show substantial overlap with manually selected channels, supporting
the interpretability of the approach. Our results suggest that EEGChaT is an
effective and generalizable solution for channel selection in high-dimensional
SEEG analysis, offering both enhanced performance and insights into neural
signal relevance.

Motivation: 当前高维时空数据建模面临几何结构不规则、时间动态快速、多变量联合预测等挑战，需要开发能够有效结合物理约束和几何先验的方法。

Result: 在3D心脏电动力学建模任务上的数值实验表明，该方法相比现有方法显著提高了预测精度。

Conclusion: P-M-GP框架通过有效整合领域特定的物理约束和几何先验，为复杂时空动态系统建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in sensing and imaging technologies have enabled the
collection of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data across complex geometric
domains. However, effective modeling of such data remains challenging due to
irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly
predict multiple interrelated physical variables. This paper presents a
physics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for
spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware,
multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies. To further enhance the
model fidelity and robustness, we incorporate governing physical laws through a
physics-based regularization scheme, thereby constraining predictions to be
consistent with governing dynamical principles. We validate the proposed P-M-GP
framework on a 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling task. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy over
existing methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical
constraints and geometric prior.

Motivation: 由于隐私法规和安全要求，联邦学习需要能够快速有效地移除特定客户端对模型的贡献，但现有方法需要多轮通信，导致模型在删除过程中不可用。

Method: 使用任务算术和神经正切核技术，开发了一种快速移除客户端影响的创新解决方案。

Result: 该方法能够快速移除客户端对模型的影响，避免了传统方法需要多轮通信的问题。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为联邦学习中的数据删除提供了更高效的解决方案，能够满足时效性要求。

Abstract: Nowdays, there are an abundance of portable devices capable of collecting
large amounts of data and with decent computational power. This opened the
possibility to train AI models in a distributed manner, preserving the
participating clients' privacy. However, because of privacy regulations and
safety requirements, elimination upon necessity of a client contribution to the
model has become mandatory. The cleansing process must satisfy specific
efficacy and time requirements. In recent years, research efforts have produced
several knowledge removal methods, but these require multiple communication
rounds between the data holders and the process coordinator. This can cause the
unavailability of an effective model up to the end of the removal process,
which can result in a disservice to the system users. In this paper, we
introduce an innovative solution based on Task Arithmetic and the Neural
Tangent Kernel, to rapidly remove a client's influence from a model.

Motivation: 现有GNN架构表达能力有限，而更强大的架构通常计算成本过高。需要开发既高效又具有更强表达能力的GNN架构。

Method: 基于Chiba和Nishizeki的经典三角形计数算法，提出EB-1WL测试和EB-GNN架构，在消息传递过程中显式利用三角形结构。

Result: EB-1WL比1-WL显著更具表达能力；EB-GNN在保持近线性复杂度的同时，大幅优于简单MPNN，与专用GNN竞争且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: EB-GNN是高效通用的GNN架构，在保持计算效率的同时提供了更强的表达能力，是表达能力和效率之间的良好平衡。

Abstract: We propose EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test, and a corresponding
GNN architecture, EB-GNN. Our architecture is inspired by a classic triangle
counting algorithm by Chiba and Nishizeki, and explicitly uses triangles during
message passing. We achieve the following results: (1)~EB-1WL is significantly
more expressive than 1-WL. Further, we provide a complete logical
characterization of EB-1WL based on first-order logic, and matching
distinguishability results based on homomorphism counting. (2)~In an important
distinction from previous proposals for more expressive GNN architectures,
EB-1WL and EB-GNN require near-linear time and memory on practical graph
learning tasks. (3)~Empirically, we show that EB-GNN is a highly-efficient
general-purpose architecture: It substantially outperforms simple MPNNs, and
remains competitive with task-specialized GNNs while being significantly more

TL;DR: 该论文为经典非线性降维方法（如t-SNE、Isomap、LLE）构建了神经解码器框架，首次实现了双向映射，并在此基础上开发了基于扩散的生成过程。实验发现这些方法在重构质量和生成样本质量上均不如端到端优化的自编码器。

Motivation: 经典非线性降维技术擅长创建低维嵌入用于可视化，但缺乏将嵌入映射回原始高维空间的能力，这限制了它们在生成应用中的使用。本文旨在填补这一关键空白。

Method: 提出了系统性的神经解码器架构框架，为主要的非线性降维方法构建解码器，并实现了在这些学习到的流形空间上直接操作的扩散生成过程。

Result: 在CelebA数据集上的实验表明，解码器能够成功重构数据，但质量不如端到端优化的自编码器。流形约束的扩散生成产生低质量样本，表明经典非线性降维嵌入的离散和稀疏特性不适合生成模型所需的连续插值。

Conclusion: 这项工作凸显了在主要为可视化和分析设计的非线性降维方法上改造生成能力所面临的固有挑战。

Abstract: Classical nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques like t-SNE,
Isomap, and LLE excel at creating low-dimensional embeddings for data
visualization but fundamentally lack the ability to map these embeddings back
to the original high-dimensional space. This one-way transformation limits
their use in generative applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by
introducing a system- atic framework for constructing neural decoder
architectures for prominent NLDR methods, enabling bidirectional mapping for
the first time. We extend this framework by implementing a diffusion-based
generative process that operates directly within these learned manifold spaces.
Through experiments on the CelebA dataset, we evaluate the reconstruction and
generative performance of our approach against autoencoder and standard
diffusion model baselines. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade- off: while
the decoders successfully reconstruct data, their quality is surpassed by
end-to-end optimized autoencoders. Moreover, manifold-constrained diffusion
yields poor-quality samples, suggesting that the discrete and sparse nature of
classical NLDR embeddings is ill-suited for the continuous inter- polation
required by generative models. This work highlights the inherent challenges in
retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods designed primarily for
visualization and analysis.

Motivation: 现有量子储层计算研究主要针对单变量信号，且忽视了近期硬件的实际约束。本文旨在开发适用于多变量时间序列预测的量子储层计算方法，并验证其在当前量子设备上的实用性。

Method: 采用基于门电路的量子储层计算架构，配对注入和记忆量子比特，使用针对当前设备连接性和深度优化的Trotter化最近邻横向场Ising演化。

Result: 在Lorenz-63和ENSO数据集上分别获得0.0087和0.0036的均方误差，性能与经典储层计算相当，在某些情况下优于学习型RNN。在IBM Heron R2设备上，MTS-QRC在现实深度下保持准确性，且在ENSO上表现优于无噪声模拟器。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持基于门电路的量子储层计算在NISQ硬件上进行多变量时间序列预测的实用性，并激励系统研究硬件噪声何时以及如何有益于量子储层计算输出。

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a hardware-friendly approach to
temporal learning, yet most studies target univariate signals and overlook
near-term hardware constraints. This work introduces a gate-based QRC for
multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) that pairs injection and memory qubits and
uses a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution optimized
for current device connectivity and depth. On Lorenz-63 and ENSO, the method
achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0087 and 0.0036, respectively,
performing on par with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above
learned RNNs on both, while NVAR and clustered ESN remain stronger on some
settings. On IBM Heron R2, MTS-QRC sustains accuracy with realistic depths and,
interestingly, outperforms a noiseless simulator on ENSO; singular value
analysis indicates that device noise can concentrate variance in feature
directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this
regime. These findings support the practicality of gate-based QRC for MTS
forecasting on NISQ hardware and motivate systematic studies on when and how
hardware noise benefits QRC readouts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着时间序列基础模型的发展，现有评估方法存在多种问题，可能导致性能估计膨胀和知识错误转移，需要建立更可靠的评估框架。

Method: 通过调查现有TSFM评估方法，识别出数据划分混乱、数据集重叠、外部冲击影响等关键问题，并分析这些问题的具体表现和影响。

Result: 研究发现现有评估存在广泛的数据划分混淆，存在信息泄露风险，外部冲击导致全局模式记忆，可能夸大模型性能评估。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time
series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the
need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large
Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive
training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of
benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights
multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark
datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information
leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global
patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our
findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking
inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to
local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation
methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time
series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new,
principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data,
to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分布校准的类别不平衡分类方法RCS，通过利用多数类和中间类的高斯混合成分来估计少数类的分布参数，有效缓解了类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类别不平衡问题中分类器偏向多数类的问题，传统方法仅使用多数类分布来近似少数类统计会导致过度泛化问题。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器网络保持不平衡数据的结构，通过加权多数类和中间类的高斯混合成分来校准少数类分布参数，生成合成样本。

Result: 在多种图像、文本和表格数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比多个基线和最先进技术取得了更优越的分类性能。

Conclusion: RCS方法通过分布校准策略有效缓解了类别不平衡问题，提高了分类器的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the insufficiency of data in certain
classes, which causes a classifier to be biased toward the majority class.
Distribution calibration is a technique that seeks to estimate a more accurate
class distribution based on an observed or estimated one. To address this
issue, we propose a distribution calibration-based method-Rebalancing with
Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced
Classification, which estimates the distribution parameters of the minority
classes using weighted parameters derived from a mixture of Gaussian components
from both the majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is
trained to preserve the structure of the imbalanced data and prevent
disentanglement. After training, feature vectors extracted from the encoder are
used to generate synthetic samples through our distribution calibration
strategy. This approach effectively mitigates the overgeneralization problem
that arises when only the distribution of the majority class is used to
approximate the minority class statistics. Instead, our method calibrates the
parameters by leveraging the distribution of data points in neighboring
regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior classification performance compared to several baseline and
state-of-the-art techniques across a diverse range of image, text, and tabular
datasets.

Conclusion: XNN架构成功解决了物理数据中维度变化问题，为PDE基础模型提供了有效的维度无关解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced
general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot
inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics
data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a
unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems.
Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate
encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To
address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the
Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as
Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor
dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE
foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance
across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple
PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform
competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to
unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining
for foundation models.

Abstract: Diagonal preconditioners are computationally feasible approximate to
second-order optimizers, which have shown significant promise in accelerating
training of deep learning models. Two predominant approaches are based on Adam
and Gauss-Newton (GN) methods: the former leverages statistics of current
gradients and is the de-factor optimizers for neural networks, and the latter
uses the diagonal elements of the Gauss-Newton matrix and underpins some of the
recent diagonal optimizers such as Sophia.
  In this work, we compare these two diagonal preconditioning methods through
the lens of two key factors: the choice of basis in the preconditioner, and the
impact of gradient noise from mini-batching. To gain insights, we analyze these
optimizers on quadratic objectives and logistic regression under all four
quadrants. We show that regardless of the basis, there exist instances where
Adam outperforms both GN$^{-1}$ and GN$^{-1/2}$ in full-batch settings.
Conversely, in the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN$^{-1/2}$ for
linear regression under a Gaussian data assumption. These theoretical results
are supported by empirical studies on both convex and non-convex objectives.

Motivation: RLHF在语言模型对齐中面临奖励过优化的挑战，主要由于奖励模型的错误泛化和RL优化中缺乏合适的正则化约束。

Conclusion: 该工作通过信息理论方法显著推进了RLHF技术的发展，提供了系统性的奖励过优化解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
aligning language models with human values, reward hacking-or reward
over-optimization-remains a major challenge. We identify two key obstacles to
its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward
models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of
suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level
constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we
propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant
information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that
reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent
space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution.
Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that
penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape
while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to
the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present
Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying
reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online
mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs
and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of
InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively
advancing the state of RLHF.

Motivation: 现有的大规模环境并行化方法虽然加速了训练时间，但仍需要大量环境交互才能达到理想性能。结构良好的表示可以改善深度强化学习的泛化能力和样本效率。

Method: 提出单纯形嵌入方法，这是一种轻量级的表示层，将嵌入约束到单纯形结构中，产生稀疏和离散的特征。

Result: 在FastTD3、FastSAC和PPO算法上应用单纯形嵌入，在各种连续和离散控制环境中一致提升了样本效率和最终性能，且没有损失运行速度。

Conclusion: 单纯形嵌入通过几何归纳偏置有效改善了强化学习算法的性能，为加速训练提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of
actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization;
unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment
interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that
well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample
efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of
simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain
embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in
sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen
policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial
embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across
a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in
runtime speed.

Conclusion: 提出的凸松弛方法结合Frank-Wolfe算法为LLM剪枝提供了理论保证和实际性能提升。

Abstract: Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements
of Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model
to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the
per-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full
retraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However,
finding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it
to optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics
that ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective. In this work, we
instead consider the convex relaxation of these combinatorial constraints and
solve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Our method
drastically reduces the per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines
on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient. We provide
theoretical justification by showing that, combined with the convergence
guarantees of the FW algorithm, we obtain an approximate solution to the
original combinatorial problem upon rounding the relaxed solution to
integrality.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了深度学习模型在千米尺度气候降尺度任务中的表现，发现现有模型在地理泛化和物理一致性方面存在不足，并提出使用功率谱密度损失函数来改进模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 千米尺度天气数据对实际应用至关重要，但传统天气模拟计算成本高。深度学习模型提供了更快的替代方案，但其可靠性仍存疑问，因为评估通常使用标准机器学习指标而非基于大气物理学的诊断方法。

Method: 对最先进的深度学习模型进行基准测试，引入基于物理学的诊断方法来评估性能，特别关注地理泛化和物理一致性。提出使用功率谱密度损失函数来改进小尺度物理结构的重建。

Result: 实验表明，即使像CorrDiff这样的模型在训练区域（如中欧）表现良好，但在其他地区（如伊比利亚半岛、摩洛哥或斯堪的纳维亚）泛化能力差。模型也无法准确捕捉从预测速度场导出的二阶变量（如散度和涡度）。

Conclusion: 现有深度学习模型在气候降尺度任务中存在地理泛化和物理一致性的挑战。提出的功率谱密度损失函数能经验性地改善地理泛化能力，但需要进一步研究来确保物理一致性。

Abstract: Kilometer-scale weather data is crucial for real-world applications but
remains computationally intensive to produce using traditional weather
simulations. An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a
faster alternative for climate downscaling. However, their reliability is still
in question, as they are often evaluated using standard machine learning
metrics rather than insights from atmospheric and weather physics. This paper
benchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models and introduces
physics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their performance and reliability,
with a particular focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency.
Our experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong performance of models
such as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European geographies (e.g.,
central Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions such as Iberia,
Morocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north. They also fail to accurately
capture second-order variables such as divergence and vorticity derived from
predicted velocity fields. These deficiencies appear even in in-distribution
geographies, indicating challenges in producing physically consistent
predictions. We propose a simple initial solution: introducing a power spectral
density loss function that empirically improves geographic generalization by
encouraging the reconstruction of small-scale physical structures. The code for
reproducing the experimental results can be found at

Result: 算法在可聚类的BMDPs类上实现了O(√T+n)的遗憾界，比之前最好的O(√T+n²)有所改进，特别是在n较大时。

Conclusion: 该算法在BMDPs类上实现了渐近最优性，证明了准确估计潜在状态确实能有效加速学习。

Abstract: The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical
in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces.
Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate
learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision
Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but
where transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent
advances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this
latent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to
determine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now
addressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages
clustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed
effectively speed up learning.
  Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first
learns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an
optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm
achieves a regret that is $O(\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible
to clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the
cardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\cdot)$ holds
up to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior
bound, $O(\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that
no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs.
This establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic
optimality.

Conclusion: 该渐进式多保真度代理模型能有效处理多模态数据，防止新数据整合时的性能下降，并基于可用输入自动调整预测。

Abstract: Highly accurate datasets from numerical or physical experiments are often
expensive and time-consuming to acquire, posing a significant challenge for
applications that require precise evaluations, potentially across multiple
scenarios and in real-time. Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate
models can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data.
Conversely, less expensive, low-fidelity data can be computed more easily and
encompass a broader range of scenarios. By leveraging multi-fidelity
information, prediction capabilities of surrogates can be improved. However, in
practical situations, data may be different in types, come from sources of
different modalities, and not be concurrently available, further complicating
the modeling process. To address these challenges, we introduce a progressive
multi-fidelity surrogate model. This model can sequentially incorporate diverse
data types using tailored encoders. Multi-fidelity regression from the encoded
inputs to the target quantities of interest is then performed using neural
networks. Input information progressively flows from lower to higher fidelity
levels through two sets of connections: concatenations among all the encoded
inputs, and additive connections among the final outputs. This dual connection
system enables the model to exploit correlations among different datasets while
ensuring that each level makes an additive correction to the previous level
without altering it. This approach prevents performance degradation as new
input data are integrated into the model and automatically adapts predictions
based on the available inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
on numerical benchmarks and a real-world case study, showing that it reliably
integrates multi-modal data and provides accurate predictions, maintaining
performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations.

Conclusion: TGPS方法通过张量分解和高效训练策略，成功解决了传统GP求解器的可扩展性问题，为大规模PDE求解提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have
attracted growing interest. However, most existing approaches, such as neural
network solvers, rely on stochastic training, which is inefficient and
typically requires a great many training epochs. Gaussian process
(GP)/kernel-based solvers, while mathematical principled, suffer from
scalability issues when handling large numbers of collocation points often
needed for challenging or higher-dimensional PDEs.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose TGPS, a tensor-GP-based solver that
models factor functions along each input dimension using one-dimensional GPs
and combines them via tensor decomposition to approximate the full solution.
This design reduces the task to learning a collection of one-dimensional GPs,
substantially lowering computational complexity, and enabling scalability to
massive collocation sets.
  For efficient nonlinear PDE solving, we use a partial freezing strategy and
Newton's method to linerize the nonlinear terms. We then develop an alternating
least squares (ALS) approach that admits closed-form updates, thereby
substantially enhancing the training efficiency. We establish theoretical
guarantees on the expressivity of our model, together with convergence proof
and error analysis under standard regularity assumptions. Experiments on
several benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy
and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health
indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data.
Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation
models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and
lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present
UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal
Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process
different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data,
cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs
are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified
representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide
demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance
compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms
prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during
inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training.
UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given
location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability
across diverse data availability scenarios. All source code is available at

Motivation: 尽管强化学习已成为训练大型语言模型的核心方法，但该领域缺乏与预训练相当的预测性扩展方法。随着计算预算的快速增长，目前没有原则性的方法来评估RL计算扩展的算法改进。

Method: 通过超过400,000 GPU小时的系统性研究，拟合RL训练的S型计算-性能曲线，并消融分析各种常见设计选择对渐近性能和计算效率的影响。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language
models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable
to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets,
there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic
improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale
systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a
principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit
sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of
common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and
compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic
performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum,
and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without
materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow
predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale
runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and
demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation
performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work
provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a
practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long
achieved in pre-training.

Conclusion: 结合拓扑和谱洞察是推进时序图学习前沿的有力方法。

Abstract: Temporal graph classification plays a critical role in applications such as
cybersecurity, brain connectivity analysis, social dynamics, and traffic
monitoring. Despite its significance, this problem remains underexplored
compared to temporal link prediction or node forecasting. Existing methods
often rely on snapshot-based or recurrent architectures that either lose
fine-grained temporal information or struggle with long-range dependencies.
Moreover, local message-passing approaches suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal structures.
  We introduce T3former, a novel Topological Temporal Transformer that
leverages sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class
tokens, integrated via a specialized Descriptor-Attention mechanism. This
design preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, and enables principled
cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization. T3former achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including dynamic
social networks, brain functional connectivity datasets, and traffic networks.
It also offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and
structural perturbations. Our results highlight the power of combining
topological and spectral insights for advancing the frontier of temporal graph
learning.

### [126] [Provably Invincible Adversarial Attacks on Reinforcement Learning Systems: A Rate-Distortion Information-Theoretic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13792)
*Ziqing Lu,Lifeng Lai,Weiyu Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息论的"不可战胜"对抗攻击方法，通过随机改变智能体对转移核的观察来限制其获取真实环境信息，证明了这种攻击对智能体奖励遗憾的下界影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性对抗攻击可被智能体通过逆转攻击来防御，需要研究更强大的攻击方法来增强RL系统的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用率失真信息论方法，随机改变智能体对转移核等环境属性的观察，限制其在训练期间获取真实信息。

Result: 推导了受害智能体奖励遗憾的信息论下界，并展示了该攻击对最先进的基于模型和无模型算法的影响。

Conclusion: 这种信息论方法可扩展到其他类型的对抗攻击，如状态观察攻击，为RL系统安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has emerged
in many security-related applications, such as autonomous driving, financial
decisions, and drone/robot algorithms. In order to improve the
robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various
adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work
considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the
recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In
this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of
adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion
information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the
transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very
limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during
the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient
agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this
notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial
attack, such as state observation attacks.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用模拟数据进行预训练的方法，显著减少对真实观测数据标注的需求，在多个天文任务中表现出优异的迁移性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决天文时间序列分析中标注观测数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 使用基于分类器的架构，结合对比学习和对抗性目标，在多个天文调查（ZTF和LSST）的模拟数据上进行预训练。

Result: 模型在分类、红移估计和异常检测等任务中显著优于基线方法，并展现出有效的零样本迁移能力，能够跨不同天文现象进行泛化。

Conclusion: 该方法为标注数据稀缺但领域知识可通过模拟编码的场景提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Astronomical time-series analysis faces a critical limitation: the scarcity
of labeled observational data. We present a pre-training approach that
leverages simulations, significantly reducing the need for labeled examples
from real observations. Our models, trained on simulated data from multiple
astronomical surveys (ZTF and LSST), learn generalizable representations that
transfer effectively to downstream tasks. Using classifier-based architectures
enhanced with contrastive and adversarial objectives, we create domain-agnostic
models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements over baseline
methods in classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection when
fine-tuned with minimal real data. Remarkably, our models exhibit effective
zero-shot transfer capabilities, achieving comparable performance on future
telescope (LSST) simulations when trained solely on existing telescope (ZTF)
data. Furthermore, they generalize to very different astronomical phenomena
(namely variable stars from NASA's \textit{Kepler} telescope) despite being
trained on transient events, demonstrating cross-domain capabilities. Our
approach provides a practical solution for building general models when labeled
data is scarce, but domain knowledge can be encoded in simulations.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了Protenix-Mini+，一种轻量化的蛋白质结构预测模型，通过压缩不可扩展操作、移除冗余模块和使用少步采样器，在可接受的性能损失下显著提升计算效率90%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AF3及其变体在生物分子结构预测中的高推理延迟和立方时间复杂度的限制，平衡模型效率与预测精度。

Method: 采用三个关键创新：(1)压缩不可扩展操作以减轻立方时间复杂度；(2)移除模块间冗余块以减少不必要开销；(3)在原子扩散模块中使用少步采样器加速推理。

Result: 在低同源性单链蛋白质案例中，Protenix-Mini+相对于完整Protenix模型的intra-protein LDDT下降约3%，但计算效率显著提升90%以上。

Conclusion: Protenix-Mini+在可接受的性能范围内实现了计算效率的大幅提升，为大规模生物分子复合物的结构预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Lightweight inference is critical for biomolecular structure prediction and
downstream tasks, enabling efficient real-world deployment and inference-time
scaling for large-scale applications. While AF3 and its variants (e.g.,
Protenix, Chai-1) have advanced structure prediction results, they suffer from
critical limitations: high inference latency and cubic time complexity with
respect to token count, both of which restrict scalability for large
biomolecular complexes. To address the core challenge of balancing model
efficiency and prediction accuracy, we introduce three key innovations: (1)
compressing non-scalable operations to mitigate cubic time complexity, (2)
removing redundant blocks across modules to reduce unnecessary overhead, and
(3) adopting a few-step sampler for the atom diffusion module to accelerate
inference. Building on these design principles, we develop Protenix-Mini+, a
highly lightweight and scalable variant of the Protenix model. Within an
acceptable range of performance degradation, it substantially improves
computational efficiency. For example, in the case of low-homology single-chain
proteins, Protenix-Mini+ experiences an intra-protein LDDT drop of
approximately 3% relative to the full Protenix model -- an acceptable
performance trade-off given its substantially 90%+ improved computational
efficiency.

*Jude Haris,José Cano*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出了一种灵活的块浮点量化（F-BFQ）加速器，能够在不同BFP量化变体间动态切换，以加速边缘设备上的LLM推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在边缘设备的部署需求增加，需要支持混合BFP量化的专用加速器来避免因重新配置导致的效率损失。

Method: 设计F-BFQ加速器，支持动态切换两种BFP量化变体并执行矩阵乘法操作，部署在AMD Kria板上。

Result: 在三种BFP量化LLM上，相比基于Arm NEON的CPU执行，平均减少1.4倍推理时间，达到5.2 tokens/秒（约3.9 words/秒）。

Conclusion: F-BFQ加速器有效提升了边缘设备上BFP量化LLM的推理性能，支持动态量化变体切换。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly prominent for daily
tasks, from improving sound-totext translation to generating additional frames
for the latest video games. With the help of LLM inference frameworks, such as
llama.cpp, which support optimizations such as KV-caching and quantization, it
is now easier than ever to deploy LLMs on edge devices. Quantization is
fundamental to enable LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices, and llama.cpp
utilizes block floating point (BFP) quantization to drastically reduce the bit
width of weights and input tensors, the memory footprint, and the computational
power required to run LLMs. LLMs are typically quantized with mixed BFP
quantization across the model layers to reduce the loss of model accuracy due
to quantization. Therefore, to efficiently accelerate across the layers of
BFP-quantized LLMs, specialized accelerators need to support different BFP
variants without reconfiguration. To address this issue, we propose a Flexible
Block FloatingPoint Quantization (F-BFQ) accelerator, which can dynamically
switch between two BFP quantization variants and perform matrix multiplication
(MatMul) operations. Our initial F-BFQ accelerator design, deployed on the AMD
Kria board, reduces inference time by 1.4x on average over the Arm NEON-based
CPU execution across three BFP quantized LLMs while achieving 5.2 tokens per
second (~3.9 words per second).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的计算和内存成本持续增长，现有权重分解方法导致运行时分解延迟过高，抵消了分解带来的好处。

Method: 采用渐进分解算法(Lanczos算法)，设计协同加速器架构，引入计算复制方法解决内存瓶颈，开发输出形状保持计算方案，并使用多通道分解方法处理异常通道。

Result: 实现了6.2倍的加速，端到端延迟比A100 GPU提升22%，模型质量仅轻微下降(如AI2推理挑战任务下降3%)。

Conclusion: 通过合适的分解算法和硬件支持，输入分解可以显著有益，D-com加速器在保持模型质量的同时大幅提升了性能。

Abstract: The computation and memory costs of large language models kept increasing
over last decade, which reached over the scale of 1T parameters. To address the
challenges from the large scale models, model compression techniques such as
low-rank decomposition have been explored. Previous model decomposition works
have focused on weight decomposition to avoid costly runtime decomposition,
whose latency often significantly exceeds the benefits from decomposition
(e.g., 38% more end-to-end latency when running Llama2-7b on A100 with 4K
sequence length with activation decomposition compared to no decomposition). In
this work, we debunk such observations and report that the input decomposition
can be significantly beneficial with a proper choice of decomposition algorithm
and hardware support. We adopt progressive decomposition algorithm, Lanczos
algorithm, and design a co-accelerator architecture for the decomposition
algorithm. To address the memory- boundness of the decomposition operation, we
introduce a novel compute replication methodology that moves the op- eration
toward compute-bound region, which enables 6.2x speedup in our evaluation. We
also develop an output shape- preserving computation scheme that eliminates
decomposi- tion costs in consecutive layers. To compensate model quality loss
from compression, we introduce a multi-track decom- position approach that
separately handles outlier channels for high accuracy and low perplexity with
minimal compu- tational costs. Combined together, our accelerator, D-com,
provides 22% end-to-end latency improvements compared to A100 GPU at the cost
of small model quality degradation (e.g., 3% on AI2 Reasoning Challenge task).

*Dan Jacobellis,Mateen Ulhaq,Fabien Racapé,Hyomin Choi,Neeraja J. Yadwadkar*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Dedelayed是一种延迟校正方法，通过结合轻量级本地模型和远程模型的历史特征处理，缓解远程推理延迟，实现实时低延迟输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程推理允许轻量设备使用强大云模型，但网络延迟导致预测过时，不适合实时任务。需要解决延迟问题以保持实时性。

Method: 使用轻量级本地模型处理当前帧，并融合远程模型从过去帧计算的特征，实现延迟校正。

Result: 在BDD100K驾驶数据集上，Dedelayed在所有超过33ms的现实网络延迟下都优于本地或远程基线。在100ms往返延迟下，比纯本地推理提高6.4 mIoU，比远程推理提高9.8 mIoU。

Conclusion: 该方法在较长延迟和高运动场景下优势更明显，为需要与当前世界状态保持一致的实时任务提供了明确优势。

Abstract: Remote inference allows lightweight devices to leverage powerful cloud
models. However, communication network latency makes predictions stale and
unsuitable for real-time tasks. To address this, we introduce Dedelayed, a
delay-corrective method that mitigates arbitrary remote inference delays,
allowing the local device to produce low-latency outputs in real time. Our
method employs a lightweight local model that processes the current frame and
fuses in features that a heavyweight remote model computes from past frames. On
video from the BDD100K driving dataset, Dedelayed improves semantic
segmentation accuracy over the stronger of the local-only and remote-only
baselines across all realistic communication network delays beyond 33 ms.
Without incurring additional delay, it improves accuracy by 6.4 mIoU compared
to fully local inference and 9.8 mIoU compared to remote inference, for a
round-trip delay of 100 ms. The advantage grows under longer delays and
higher-motion scenes, as delay-mitigated split inference sustains accuracy more
effectively, providing clear advantages for real-time tasks that must remain
aligned with the current world state.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动网络运营商需要有效评估网络覆盖并精确识别服务弱区，以提升用户体验质量(QoE)。

Method: 在单个天线级别进行覆盖分析，然后聚合到站点级别；应用单类支持向量机(OC-SVM)算法计算移动网络覆盖，将决策超平面建模为有效覆盖边界；扩展该方法分析众包服务丢失报告。

Result: 该框架能准确映射移动网络覆盖，并在复杂城市环境中突出显示细粒度的信号缺失区域。

Conclusion: 所提出的新颖框架在移动网络覆盖映射和弱信号点识别方面表现出高效性，特别适用于复杂城市环境。

Abstract: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise
identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators
striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a
novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising
crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis
at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site
level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is
the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for
calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision
hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation
of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology
is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying
and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and,
crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly
within complex urban environments.

TL;DR: 提出了RID框架，一种零样本元提示技术，通过结构化认知模式帮助LLM处理规则与意图冲突，显著提升人类对齐度至95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在作为智能体推理引擎时存在规则刚性缺陷，过度遵循显式规则导致决策与人类常识和意图不一致，而传统监督微调方法计算成本高且难以普及。

Method: RID框架：通过元提示技术为LLM提供结构化认知模式，包括任务解构、规则分类、结果权衡和决策论证，实现零样本的人类对齐异常处理。

Result: 在20个需要微妙判断的场景基准测试中，RID框架达到95%的人类对齐分数，显著优于基线(80%)和思维链提示(75%)，产生更高质量的意图驱动推理。

Conclusion: RID框架提供了一种实用、易用且有效的方法，引导LLM从字面指令遵循转向目标导向推理，为构建更可靠实用的AI智能体铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning
engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid
adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human
common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to
building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,
SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To
address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a
novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned
exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides
the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,
classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final
decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced
judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that
the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human
Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.
Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.
This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering
LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,
paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

Conclusion: 该框架和分析方法为大规模自动化驾驶员危险行为检测提供了稳健且可解释的解决方案，为交通安全分析和干预提供了新机会。

Abstract: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second
decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle
crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway
crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying
Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation,
yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by
inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an
innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to
automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the
validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of
two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on
detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional
machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a
neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%,
surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in
scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a
probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original
test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver
distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one
driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving";
distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took
Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the
probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical
methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated
DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and
intervention.

TL;DR: 提出了基于偏好的奖励修复框架，通过从人类偏好中学习过渡依赖的修正项来修复人工设计的代理奖励函数，解决奖励函数错配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工设计的奖励函数经常与人类真实目标不匹配，导致策略错位；而从零学习奖励函数成本高昂。需要一种折中方法来修正现有奖励函数。

Method: 使用目标探索策略和新的偏好学习目标，从少量偏好中学习过渡依赖的加法修正项来修复代理奖励函数。

Result: 在表格域中具有与现有偏好强化学习方法相当的累积遗憾，在奖励黑客基准测试中表现优于基线方法，需要更少偏好即可学习高性能策略。

Conclusion: PBRR框架能有效修正错配的代理奖励函数，比从零学习奖励函数更高效，比直接修改代理奖励函数的方法表现更好。

Abstract: Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are
frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus
act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often
induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true
objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves
learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over
pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address
the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair
(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy
reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term
from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that
are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only
a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and
correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a
new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a
cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based
RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR
consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch
from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,
requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.

Conclusion: Empower提供了一个仅使用离线数据、无需额外人工反馈或可验证奖励的大规模有用对齐AI代理框架。

Abstract: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also
step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be
made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via
mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often
encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the
human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly
explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach
to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's
empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our
empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,
providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better
assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person
user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.
Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%
higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a
new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated
humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower
increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding
questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment
objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using
only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or
verifiable rewards.

Conclusion: Hard2Verify基准揭示了当前验证器在数学证明步骤级验证方面的局限性，为改进验证能力提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved
gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical
proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but
also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,
open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes
are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,
step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.
Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the
frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first
error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and
open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward
models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag
closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in
step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as
fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation
dynamics.

Conclusion: 可引导先验能够减轻基于扩散的PET重建中的域偏移问题，为未来在真实数据上的评估提供了概念验证。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently enabled state-of-the-art reconstruction of
positron emission tomography (PET) images while requiring only image training
data. However, domain shift remains a key concern for clinical adoption: priors
trained on images from one anatomy, acquisition protocol or pathology may
produce artefacts on out-of-distribution data. We propose integrating steerable
conditional diffusion (SCD) with our previously-introduced likelihood-scheduled
diffusion (PET-LiSch) framework to improve the alignment of the diffusion
model's prior to the target subject. At reconstruction time, for each diffusion
step, we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to align the diffusion model prior with
the target domain on the fly. Experiments on realistic synthetic 2D brain
phantoms demonstrate that our approach suppresses hallucinated artefacts under
domain shift, i.e. when our diffusion model is trained on perturbed images and
tested on normal anatomy, our approach suppresses the hallucinated structure,
outperforming both OSEM and diffusion model baselines qualitatively and
quantitatively. These results provide a proof-of-concept that steerable priors
can mitigate domain shift in diffusion-based PET reconstruction and motivate
future evaluation on real data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimULi是一种实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的新方法，通过扩展3DGUT支持复杂相机模型，并添加LiDAR支持，解决了现有神经渲染方法速度慢和传感器不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法（如NeRF和3DGS）渲染速度慢，且只能渲染针孔相机模型，无法满足自动驾驶等应用中需要高畸变镜头和LiDAR数据的需求。多传感器仿真存在跨传感器不一致问题。

Method: 扩展3DGUT支持复杂相机模型，通过自动分块策略支持任意旋转LiDAR模型和基于光线的剔除。设计了因子化3D高斯表示和锚定策略来解决跨传感器不一致问题。

Result: 相比现有方法，相机和深度误差平均降低40%，渲染速度比光线追踪方法快10-20倍，比现有基于光栅化的方法快1.5-10倍，且支持更广泛的相机模型。在两个自动驾驶数据集上，SimULi在多个相机和LiDAR指标上达到或超过现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SimULi是首个能够实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，在渲染速度和跨传感器一致性方面显著优于现有技术，为自动驾驶等应用的严格测试提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

*Thomas W. Mitchel,Hyunwoo Ryu,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFactor是第一个无需几何先验、能够实现真正新视角合成的自监督模型，通过成对姿态估计和输入输出增强方案，实现了相机姿态与场景内容的解耦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督新视角合成方法的预测姿态缺乏可迁移性，同一组姿态在不同3D场景中会产生不同的相机轨迹，无法实现真正的新视角合成。

Method: 结合成对姿态估计与输入输出增强方案，无需3D归纳偏置或多视图几何概念，使用无约束的潜在姿态变量实现姿态与场景内容的解耦。

Result: XFactor显著优于先前的无姿态NVS变换器，潜在姿态与实际世界姿态高度相关，实现了真正的姿态可迁移性。

Conclusion: XFactor证明了无需显式3D几何概念也能实现真正的新视角合成，为自监督3D理解开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI会议的快速增长给同行评审系统带来压力，导致评审工作量大、专业不匹配、评价标准不一致、评审肤浅或模板化等问题。现有解决方案往往临时且不透明。

Method: 开发Paper Copilot系统，创建跨多个计算机科学会议的同行评审数字档案，构建开放数据集，并对ICLR多年的评审数据进行大规模实证分析。

Result: 提供了支持同行评审可重复研究的基础设施和数据集，使社区能够追踪变化、诊断问题模式。

Conclusion: 通过发布基础设施和数据集，Paper Copilot有助于推动基于证据的改进，建立更稳健、透明和可靠的同行评审系统。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

TL;DR: 提出样本中心的多任务学习框架，通过联合学习样本级缺陷分类和像素级掩码定位，解决工业表面缺陷检测中样本级决策稳定性不足的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测面临极端的前景-背景不平衡、缺陷稀疏性、尺度分布长尾和低对比度等挑战，现有模型在像素级指标上表现良好但样本级决策稳定性不足。

Method: 基于共享编码器架构，联合学习样本级缺陷分类和像素级掩码定位，样本级监督调制特征分布并持续提升小缺陷和低对比度缺陷的召回率。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了样本级决策的可靠性和缺陷定位的完整性。

Conclusion: 样本中心的多任务学习框架能够有效解决工业缺陷检测中样本级决策稳定性问题，提出的决策关联评估指标更符合实际质量控制需求。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型的对抗性补丁攻击(EDPA)及相应的防御策略。EDPA是一种模型无关的攻击方法，通过破坏视觉和文本潜在表示的语义对齐来干扰VLA模型，导致机器人任务失败。同时提出了对抗性微调防御方案来缓解这种攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLA模型在机器人学习领域取得了革命性进展，但其对抗鲁棒性仍未得到充分探索。本文旨在研究VLA模型的对抗脆弱性并提出相应的防御方法。

Method: 提出了嵌入破坏补丁攻击(EDPA)，这是一种模型无关的对抗攻击方法，通过优化两个目标来生成对抗补丁：(1)破坏视觉和文本潜在表示的语义对齐；(2)最大化对抗样本与干净样本潜在表示之间的差异。同时提出了对抗性微调防御策略，优化视觉编码器使其对干净和对抗样本产生相似的潜在表示。

Result: 在广泛认可的LIBERO机器人仿真基准测试中，EDPA显著提高了最先进VLA模型的任务失败率，而提出的防御方法有效缓解了这种性能下降。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了VLA模型在对抗攻击下的脆弱性，提出的EDPA攻击方法能够有效干扰模型性能，同时提出的对抗性微调防御策略为提升VLA模型的鲁棒性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at
https://edpa-attack.github.io/.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了近红外高光谱成像在食品质量分析中的应用，比较了CNN和PLS模型，发现CNN在联合空间-光谱分析中表现更优，特别是在化学和物理视觉信息相关的参数建模中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索近红外高光谱成像技术在食品质量分析中的潜力，特别是比较深度学习方法（CNN）与传统方法（PLS）在不同分析场景下的性能差异。

Method: 通过四个研究，使用CNN和PLS模型进行对比分析，包括联合空间-光谱分析、光谱卷积增强的2D CNN、基于PLS的化学图生成等。

Result: CNN在联合空间-光谱分析中优于PLS；光谱卷积层增强的2D CNN提升了预测性能；PLS在分析化学参数平均含量时表现良好；CNN在化学图生成中解决了PLS的平滑性和范围问题。

Conclusion: 近红外高光谱成像在食品质量分析中具有应用价值，CNN在复杂空间分布建模中表现优异，而PLS在简单平均含量分析中仍是推荐方法。同时开发了两个开源Python工具包。

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

Motivation: 现实世界中的面部情感识别面临头部姿态变化、遮挡、光照变化和人口多样性等挑战，现有模型在参与度检测等应用中存在局限

Method: 使用CNN特征提取器、MoE模块进行自适应特征选择，以及残差网络骨干进行深度特征学习，采用多尺度特征提取获取全局和局部面部特征

Result: 在多个数据集上取得优异性能：AffectNet(v7) 74.77%、AffectNet(v8) 72.55%、RAF-DB 84.29%、FER-2013 64.66%

Conclusion: 模型具有高度自适应性和实用性，可用于开发实际环境中的端到端情感识别系统

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频掩码自回归模型的慢启动问题（缺乏结构化全局先验）和空间时间维度上的误差累积问题。

Method: 引入画布机制（模糊的全局下一帧预测）作为掩码生成的起点，提供早期全局结构；提出组合式无分类器引导联合增强空间和时间条件；使用基于噪声的画布增强提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在BAIR和Kinetics-600基准测试中，CanvasMAR以更少的自回归步骤生成高质量视频，在Kinetics-600上表现优异，可与基于扩散的方法相媲美。

Conclusion: 画布机制有效解决了视频掩码自回归模型的关键限制，实现了更高效和高质量的视频生成。

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: 结合视觉、文本和结构化知识的方法能有效解决开放域视觉实体识别问题，特别是在处理罕见和未见实体时表现出色，同时证明了小模型也能取得优异性能。

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

Motivation: 现有的图构建方法如KNN在较大图像上计算成本高，而SVGA的固定步长尺度会导致过度压缩和错过长距离连接的信息增益。

Method: 提出对数可扩展图构建(LSGC)方法，构建LogViG混合CNN-GNN模型，采用高分辨率分支并在高低分辨率分支间融合特征。

Result: LogViG在图像分类和语义分割任务上超越了现有ViG、CNN和ViT架构，Ti-LogViG模型在ImageNet-1K上达到79.9%准确率，比Vision GNN高1.7%，参数减少24.3%，GMACs减少35.3%。

Conclusion: 通过LSGC方法在ViG中利用长距离连接可以超越当前最先进的ViG性能。

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理图表和图表等结构化视觉内容时缺乏精确推理能力，因为基于像素的感知缺乏验证机制。

Method: 提出RECODE框架：首先生成多个候选程序来重现输入图像，然后使用批评者选择最忠实的重建，并迭代优化代码。

Conclusion: 将视觉感知基于可执行代码为更准确和可验证的多模态推理提供了新路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级水印方案NoisePrints，利用扩散过程的随机种子作为作者证明，无需修改生成过程或访问模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型在视觉内容生成中的广泛应用，证明作者身份和保护版权变得至关重要。现有方法需要访问模型权重且计算量大，不实用且不可扩展。

Method: 利用扩散过程初始化使用的随机种子作为水印，通过哈希函数集成到噪声采样过程中，确保从内容中恢复有效种子不可行。使用密码学零知识证明在不泄露种子的情况下证明所有权。

Conclusion: NoisePrints提供了一种实用且可扩展的水印方案，解决了扩散模型版权保护的关键挑战，通过保护种子秘密增加了水印移除的难度。

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

*Lucas Böttcher*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文探讨了使用神经网络和现代机器学习库来参数化控制输入的方法，适用于离散时间/连续时间系统以及确定性/随机动力学，在生物学、工程学、物理学和医学等多个领域有应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 控制问题在科学和工业应用中频繁出现，目标是将动态系统从初始状态引导到期望目标状态。深度学习和自动微分的最新进展使得将这些方法应用于控制问题变得越来越实用。

Method: 对于连续时间动态系统，使用神经常微分方程（neural ODEs）来参数化控制输入；对于离散时间系统，展示了如何使用自动微分方法实现和优化自定义控制输入参数化。

Result: 提出的方法为计算需求高或分析上难以处理的控制任务提供了实用解决方案。

Conclusion: 这些方法对于复杂的现实世界应用具有重要价值，能够有效解决传统方法难以处理的控制问题。

Abstract: Control problems frequently arise in scientific and industrial applications,
where the objective is to steer a dynamical system from an initial state to a
desired target state. Recent advances in deep learning and automatic
differentiation have made applying these methods to control problems
increasingly practical. In this paper, we examine the use of neural networks
and modern machine-learning libraries to parameterize control inputs across
discrete-time and continuous-time systems, as well as deterministic and
stochastic dynamics. We highlight applications in multiple domains, including
biology, engineering, physics, and medicine. For continuous-time dynamical
systems, neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) offer a useful
approach to parameterizing control inputs. For discrete-time systems, we show
how custom control-input parameterizations can be implemented and optimized
using automatic-differentiation methods. Overall, the methods presented provide
practical solutions for control tasks that are computationally demanding or
analytically intractable, making them valuable for complex real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种条件扩散模型，用于合成低压配电站的日有功和无功功率曲线，解决了现有方法忽略变电站间协同行为的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低压配电网功率流可见性有限，现有负荷分析方法过度简化，无法捕捉变电站间的协同行为和低碳技术集成带来的负荷多样性。

Method: 使用条件扩散模型合成日有功和无功功率曲线，通过传统指标和潮流建模评估保真度，并与基准模型进行对比。

Result: 合成的负荷曲线在独立和群体层面都表现出合理性，在更广泛的电力系统背景下具有可信度。

Conclusion: 条件扩散模型能有效生成现实场景，为区域配电网络规划和运营提供可靠基础。

Abstract: Limited visibility of power distribution network power flows at the low
voltage level presents challenges to both distribution network operators from a
planning perspective and distribution system operators from a congestion
management perspective. Forestalling these challenges through scenario analysis
is confounded by the lack of realistic and coherent load data across
representative distribution feeders. Load profiling approaches often rely on
summarising demand through typical profiles, which oversimplifies the
complexity of substation-level operations and limits their applicability in
specific power system studies. Sampling methods, and more recently generative
models, have attempted to address this through synthesising representative
loads from historical exemplars; however, while these approaches can
approximate load shapes to a convincing degree of fidelity, the co-behaviour
between substations, which ultimately impacts higher voltage level network
operation, is often overlooked. This limitation will become even more
pronounced with the increasing integration of low-carbon technologies, as
estimates of base loads fail to capture load diversity. To address this gap, a
Conditional Diffusion model for synthesising daily active and reactive power
profiles at the low voltage distribution substation level is proposed. The
evaluation of fidelity is demonstrated through conventional metrics capturing
temporal and statistical realism, as well as power flow modelling. The results
show synthesised load profiles are plausible both independently and as a cohort
in a wider power systems context. The Conditional Diffusion model is
benchmarked against both naive and state-of-the-art models to demonstrate its
effectiveness in producing realistic scenarios on which to base sub-regional
power distribution network planning and operations.

### [153] [Data-driven learning of feedback maps for explicit robust predictive control: an approximation theoretic view](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13522)
*Siddhartha Ganguly,Shubham Gupta,Debasish Chatterjee*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出一种从数据中学习反馈映射的算法，用于一类鲁棒模型预测控制问题，通过直接在学习阶段考虑近似误差来确保递归可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决鲁棒MPC中反馈映射的学习问题，同时考虑学习过程中的近似误差，确保控制系统的稳定性和可行性。

Method: 采用两步法：数据生成（将minmax问题转化为凸半无限规划并精确求解）和学习近似反馈映射（使用近似方案在预设误差范围内学习反馈策略）。

Result: 算法能够生成近似反馈策略，并在标准假设下保证闭环系统的稳定性，通过两个基准数值例子验证了结果。

Conclusion: 该算法成功实现了从数据中学习鲁棒MPC反馈映射，确保递归可行性和闭环稳定性，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We establish an algorithm to learn feedback maps from data for a class of
robust model predictive control (MPC) problems. The algorithm accounts for the
approximation errors due to the learning directly at the synthesis stage,
ensuring recursive feasibility by construction. The optimal control problem
consists of a linear noisy dynamical system, a quadratic stage and quadratic
terminal costs as the objective, and convex constraints on the state, control,
and disturbance sequences; the control minimizes and the disturbance maximizes
the objective. We proceed via two steps -- (a) Data generation: First, we
reformulate the given minmax problem into a convex semi-infinite program and
employ recently developed tools to solve it in an exact fashion on grid points
of the state space to generate (state, action) data. (b) Learning approximate
feedback maps: We employ a couple of approximation schemes that furnish tight
approximations within preassigned uniform error bounds on the admissible state
space to learn the unknown feedback policy. The stability of the closed-loop
system under the approximate feedback policies is also guaranteed under a
standard set of hypotheses. Two benchmark numerical examples are provided to
illustrate the results.

*Thomas Gschwind,Shramona Chakraborty,Nitin Gupta,Sameep Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种将自然语言描述转换为可执行ETL工作流的系统，使用分类器增强生成(CAG)方法自动预测工作流结构和详细配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ETL工具如IBM DataStage需要深度工具知识和耗时配置，希望通过自然语言简化工作流创建过程。

Method: 采用分类器增强生成(CAG)方法，结合话语分解、分类器和阶段特定少样本提示来预测阶段，然后使用边缘预测连接非线性工作流，并从子话语上下文推断阶段属性。

Result: 相比强基线方法，CAG在准确性和效率方面表现更好，同时显著减少token使用量，能够端到端生成工作流并包含鲁棒验证步骤。

Conclusion: 这是首个在自然语言驱动的ETL创作中，对阶段预测、边缘布局和属性生成进行全面评估的系统，具有模块化、可解释的特点。

Abstract: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools such as IBM DataStage allow users to
visually assemble complex data workflows, but configuring stages and their
properties remains time consuming and requires deep tool knowledge. We propose
a system that translates natural language descriptions into executable
workflows, automatically predicting both the structure and detailed
configuration of the flow. At its core lies a Classifier-Augmented Generation
(CAG) approach that combines utterance decomposition with a classifier and
stage-specific few-shot prompting to produce accurate stage predictions. These
stages are then connected into non-linear workflows using edge prediction, and
stage properties are inferred from sub-utterance context. We compare CAG
against strong single-prompt and agentic baselines, showing improved accuracy
and efficiency, while substantially reducing token usage. Our architecture is
modular, interpretable, and capable of end-to-end workflow generation,
including robust validation steps. To our knowledge, this is the first system
with a detailed evaluation across stage prediction, edge layout, and property
generation for natural-language-driven ETL authoring.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTSQL-R1是一个基于强化学习的多轮Text-to-SQL训练框架，通过执行反馈和对话记忆验证实现迭代式查询生成与优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将多轮Text-to-SQL视为简单文本翻译任务，缺乏执行验证和显式优化，导致生成不可执行或不连贯的SQL查询

Method: 将任务建模为马尔可夫决策过程，代理与数据库交互获取执行反馈，利用持久对话记忆进行连贯性验证，执行"提议→执行→验证→优化"的迭代循环

Result: 在COSQL和SPARC数据集上的实验表明，MTSQL-R1持续优于强基线方法

Conclusion: 环境驱动的验证和记忆引导的优化对于对话式语义解析至关重要

Abstract: Multi-turn Text-to-SQL aims to translate a user's conversational utterances
into executable SQL while preserving dialogue coherence and grounding to the
target schema. However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple
text translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query
per turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads
to non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic
training framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as
a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database
for execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence
verification, performing an iterative propose to execute -> verify -> refine
cycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that
MTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance
of environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for
conversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models,
logs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review
to contribute to community research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了4个大语言模型（GPT-3.5、GPT-4o、Llama 3.2、Gemini 1.5）和BioBERT在从电子健康记录中分类癌症诊断的性能。BioBERT在ICD代码分类上表现最佳，而GPT-4o在自由文本诊断分类上表现最好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录包含不一致的结构化或自由文本数据，需要高效预处理以支持预测性医疗模型。虽然AI驱动的自然语言处理工具在自动诊断分类方面有潜力，但其比较性能和临床可靠性需要系统评估。

Method: 分析了3456名癌症患者的762个独特诊断（326个ICD代码描述，436个自由文本条目）。测试模型将诊断分类到14个预定义类别中，由两位肿瘤学专家验证分类结果。

Result: BioBERT在ICD代码分类中获得最高加权宏F1分数（84.2），与GPT-4o在ICD代码准确率上相当（90.8）。对于自由文本诊断，GPT-4o在加权宏F1分数（71.8 vs 61.5）和准确率（81.9 vs 81.6）上优于BioBERT。其他模型整体表现较低。

Conclusion: 虽然当前性能水平足以用于行政和研究用途，但可靠的临床应用需要标准化文档实践以及针对高风险决策的强大人为监督。

Abstract: Electronic health records contain inconsistently structured or free-text
data, requiring efficient preprocessing to enable predictive health care
models. Although artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing
tools show promise for automating diagnosis classification, their comparative
performance and clinical reliability require systematic evaluation. The aim of
this study is to evaluate the performance of 4 large language models (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Gemini 1.5) and BioBERT in classifying cancer diagnoses
from structured and unstructured electronic health records data. We analyzed
762 unique diagnoses (326 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code
descriptions, 436free-text entries) from 3456 records of patients with cancer.
Models were tested on their ability to categorize diagnoses into 14predefined
categories. Two oncology experts validated classifications. BioBERT achieved
the highest weighted macro F1-score for ICD codes (84.2) and matched GPT-4o in
ICD code accuracy (90.8). For free-text diagnoses, GPT-4o outperformed BioBERT
in weighted macro F1-score (71.8 vs 61.5) and achieved slightly higher accuracy
(81.9 vs 81.6). GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Llama showed lower overall performance on
both formats. Common misclassification patterns included confusion between
metastasis and central nervous system tumors, as well as errors involving
ambiguous or overlapping clinical terminology. Although current performance
levels appear sufficient for administrative and research use, reliable clinical
applications will require standardized documentation practices alongside robust
human oversight for high-stakes decision-making.

Abstract: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of
large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to
do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International
Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman & Karbasi,
arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the
artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem
proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover
and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure
that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is
formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises
and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology was
able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close a third of the
sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences,
2025].

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了LLMs对询问角色的鲁棒性，发现用户提供的身份、专业背景等个人信息会影响模型的事实问答准确性，导致拒绝回答、幻觉限制和角色混淆等失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs应该基于客观知识真实回答事实性问题，而不受用户个人背景信息的影响。现有研究主要关注对抗性输入，但缺乏对真实用户交互中常见个人信息影响的系统性评估。

Method: 通过评估LLMs对询问角色（用户身份、专业背景、信仰等属性）的敏感性，分析用户框架信息如何影响事实问答的可靠性。

Result: 发现询问角色线索能显著改变问答准确性，并触发拒绝回答、幻觉限制和角色混淆等失败模式，表明模型对用户框架的敏感性会损害事实可靠性。

Conclusion: 询问角色测试是评估LLMs鲁棒性的有效工具，模型对用户个人信息的敏感性会危及事实回答的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should answer factual questions truthfully,
grounded in objective knowledge, regardless of user context such as
self-disclosed personal information, or system personalization. In this paper,
we present the first systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to inquiry
personas, i.e. user profiles that convey attributes like identity, expertise,
or belief. While prior work has primarily focused on adversarial inputs or
distractors for robustness testing, we evaluate plausible, human-centered
inquiry persona cues that users disclose in real-world interactions. We find
that such cues can meaningfully alter QA accuracy and trigger failure modes
such as refusals, hallucinated limitations, and role confusion. These effects
highlight how model sensitivity to user framing can compromise factual
reliability, and position inquiry persona testing as an effective tool for
robustness evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE架构中功能相似的专家经常被同时选择，导致计算冗余和模型有效容量受限，而现有的平衡损失方法无法解决专家多样性问题。

Method: GatePro识别最相似的专家对，引入局部竞争机制，防止冗余专家共同激活，同时保持专家自然专业化，无需额外可学习参数。

Result: 综合评估表明GatePro在不同模型规模和基准测试中均有效，能实现增强的专家多样性，专家发展出更独特和互补的能力。

Conclusion: GatePro提供了一种实用的解决方案，可在任何训练阶段热插拔部署，无需额外参数，有效提升MoE模型效能。

Abstract: Modern large language models leverage Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
for efficient scaling, but face a critical challenge: functionally similar
experts are often selected simultaneously, creating redundant computation and
limiting effective model capacity. Existing auxiliary balance loss methods
improve token distribution but fail to address the underlying expert diversity
problem. We introduce GatePro, a novel parameter-free method that directly
promotes expert selection diversity. GatePro identifies the most similar expert
pairs and introduces localized competition mechanisms, preventing redundant
expert co-activation while maintaining natural expert specialization. Our
comprehensive evaluation demonstrates GatePro's effectiveness across model
scales and benchmarks. Analysis demonstrates GatePro's ability to achieve
enhanced expert diversity, where experts develop more distinct and
complementary capabilities, avoiding functional redundancy. This approach can
be deployed hot-swappable during any training phase without additional
learnable parameters, offering a practical solution for improving MoE
effectiveness.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的不确定性量化具有挑战性，现有方法存在局限性，需要从因果角度建立模型不确定性与语义不变性之间的联系。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM不确定性量化提供了有效的解决方案，建立了不确定性与语义不变性之间的因果联系。

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to improve model
reliability, yet quantifying the uncertainty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
non-trivial. In this work, we establish a connection between the uncertainty of
LLMs and their invariance under semantic-preserving intervention from a causal
perspective. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel grey-box
uncertainty quantification method that measures the variation in model outputs
before and after the semantic-preserving intervention. Through theoretical
justification, we show that our method provides an effective estimate of
epistemic uncertainty. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various LLMs
and a variety of question-answering (QA) datasets, demonstrate that our method
excels not only in terms of effectiveness but also in computational efficiency.

Result: 提出的RL策略在各种推理任务中实现了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过将优化与模型内在推理节奏对齐，将不透明的优化转变为可操作的结构感知过程，为LLM推理的透明有效优化提供了可能路径。

Abstract: The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and
Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire
generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This
work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal
logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a
mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads
between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that
locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating
phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad
downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics:
1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward
attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which
quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives
from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring
preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range
contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately
followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent
reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies
that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan
tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent
performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with
the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization
into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step
toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: NOSA是一个可训练的稀疏注意力框架，通过引入显式局部性约束来减少KV缓存传输，在保持训练时相同注意力计算的同时，显著提升解码吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法虽然减少了内存访问，但KV缓存大小未减少，限制了GPU批处理规模和解码吞吐量，特别是在大规模批处理推理中。

Method: NOSA通过将token选择分解为查询感知和查询无关组件，引入显式局部性约束，减少CPU和GPU间的KV传输，同时保持与训练时相同的注意力计算。

Result: 预训练的1B参数模型在保持接近无损性能的同时，相比基线方法(InfLLM-V2)实现了最高2.3倍的解码吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: NOSA框架有效解决了KV缓存卸载问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了解码效率，为大规模批处理推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the
decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing,
significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task
performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial
limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced,
which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput,
especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that
trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token
selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading
without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent
locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer
of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall
decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse
attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA
introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into
query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while
preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain
a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that
it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement
in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention
baseline (InfLLM-V2).

Conclusion: 利用公开目录构建指令数据集可以有效提升LLM在医疗文档任务中的性能，模型大小与准确性正相关，但微调后大小模型间的差距缩小。

Abstract: Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential
for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are
appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding
accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether
instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy
of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded
diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a
systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding
performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial
(three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000
question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS
catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families
(7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to
41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3
topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower
with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after
fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models.
Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with
model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning.
The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than
fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential
of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs
in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the
best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from

### [167] [Towards Trusted Service Monitoring: Verifiable Service Level Agreements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13370)
*Fernando Castillo,Eduardo Brito,Sebastian Werner,Pille Pullonen-Raudvere,Jonathan Heiss*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出一个基于可信硬件和零知识证明的SLA监控框架，通过密码学方法解决服务提供商自报告指标时的信任冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务导向环境中SLA监控存在固有信任冲突，服务提供商有动机少报违规情况，需要建立真正的可信机制。

Method: 将机器可读的SLA条款转换为可验证谓词，在可信执行环境中监控，收集带时间戳的遥测数据，组织成Merkle树并生成签名证明，使用零知识证明聚合服务级别指标评估合规性。

Result: 原型系统展示线性扩展能力，每小时可处理超过100万个事件，单个违规声明的证明生成和验证时间接近常数。

Conclusion: 该框架通过密码学保证实现了无需信任的SLA执行，为服务监控中的自动化合规验证提供了安全基础。

Abstract: Service Level Agreement (SLA) monitoring in service-oriented environments
suffers from inherent trust conflicts when providers self-report metrics,
creating incentives to underreport violations. We introduce a framework for
generating verifiable SLA violation claims through trusted hardware monitors
and zero-knowledge proofs, establishing cryptographic foundations for genuine
trustworthiness in service ecosystems. Our approach starts with
machine-readable SLA clauses converted into verifiable predicates and monitored
within Trusted Execution Environments. These monitors collect timestamped
telemetry, organize measurements into Merkle trees, and produce signed
attestations. Zero-knowledge proofs aggregate Service-Level Indicators to
evaluate compliance, generating cryptographic proofs verifiable by
stakeholders, arbitrators, or insurers in disputes, without accessing
underlying data. This ensures three security properties: integrity,
authenticity, and validity. Our prototype demonstrates linear scaling up to
over 1 million events per hour for measurements with near constant-time proof
generation and verification for single violation claims, enabling trustless SLA
enforcement through cryptographic guarantees for automated compliance
verification in service monitoring.

TL;DR: TrapNet是一个新颖、可扩展、无监督的恶意软件指纹识别和分组框架，使用图社区检测技术基于静态分析进行恶意软件家族归因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意软件数量激增，手动分析不现实，需要开发专门的初步过滤技术来基于语义相似性对恶意软件进行分组。

Method: 1) 检测并解包二进制文件；2) 使用FloatHash生成捕获底层语义的数值模糊哈希向量；3) 构建恶意软件相似性网络；4) 应用社区检测算法识别密集社区。

Result: 广泛评估表明TrapNet在检测社区的覆盖率和纯度方面有效，且运行效率优于其他最先进解决方案。

Conclusion: TrapNet提供了一个高效且可扩展的恶意软件指纹识别和分组解决方案，能够处理大规模恶意软件分析任务。

Abstract: Malware proliferation is increasing at a tremendous rate, with hundreds of
thousands of new samples identified daily. Manual investigation of such a vast
amount of malware is an unrealistic, time-consuming, and overwhelming task. To
cope with this volume, there is a clear need to develop specialized techniques
and efficient tools for preliminary filtering that can group malware based on
semantic similarity. In this paper, we propose TrapNet, a novel, scalable, and
unsupervised framework for malware fingerprinting and grouping. TrapNet employs
graph community detection techniques for malware fingerprinting and family
attribution based on static analysis, as follows: (1) TrapNet detects packed
binaries and unpacks them using known generic packer tools. (2) From each
malware sample, it generates a digest that captures the underlying semantics.
Since the digest must be dense, efficient, and suitable for similarity
checking, we designed FloatHash (FH), a novel numerical fuzzy hashing technique
that produces a short real-valued vector summarizing the underlying assembly
items and their order. FH is based on applying Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) to ordered assembly items (e.g., opcodes, function calls) extracted from
the malware's assembly code. (3) Representing malware with short numerical
vectors enables high-performance, large-scale similarity computation, which
allows TrapNet to build a malware similarity network. (4) Finally, TrapNet
employs state-of-the-art community detection algorithms to identify dense
communities, which represent groups of malware with similar semantics. Our
extensive evaluation of TrapNet demonstrates its effectiveness in terms of the
coverage and purity of the detected communities, while also highlighting its
runtime efficiency, which outperforms other state-of-the-art solutions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SimKey是一种语义密钥模块，通过将密钥生成与上下文语义绑定，提高LLM水印的鲁棒性，防止有害内容的错误归属。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM水印方法存在两个问题：(i)对表面级编辑（如改写、重排序）脆弱；(ii)攻击者可以附加无关有害文本来继承水印，损害模型所有者声誉。

Method: 使用局部敏感哈希对语义嵌入进行处理，确保改写文本产生相同水印密钥，而无关或语义偏移文本产生不同密钥。

Result: SimKey与最先进水印方案集成，提高了对改写和翻译的水印鲁棒性，同时防止有害内容的错误归属。

Conclusion: 语义感知密钥生成是实用且可扩展的水印方向。

Abstract: The rapid spread of text generated by large language models (LLMs) makes it
increasingly difficult to distinguish authentic human writing from machine
output. Watermarking offers a promising solution: model owners can embed an
imperceptible signal into generated text, marking its origin. Most leading
approaches seed an LLM's next-token sampling with a pseudo-random key that can
later be recovered to identify the text as machine-generated, while only
minimally altering the model's output distribution. However, these methods
suffer from two related issues: (i) watermarks are brittle to simple
surface-level edits such as paraphrasing or reordering; and (ii) adversaries
can append unrelated, potentially harmful text that inherits the watermark,
risking reputational damage to model owners. To address these issues, we
introduce SimKey, a semantic key module that strengthens watermark robustness
by tying key generation to the meaning of prior context. SimKey uses
locality-sensitive hashing over semantic embeddings to ensure that paraphrased
text yields the same watermark key, while unrelated or semantically shifted
text produces a different one. Integrated with state-of-the-art watermarking
schemes, SimKey improves watermark robustness to paraphrasing and translation
while preventing harmful content from false attribution, establishing
semantic-aware keying as a practical and extensible watermarking direction.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LATTICE是一个分层检索框架，通过语义树结构组织语料库，使LLM能够以对数搜索复杂度推理和导航大型语料库，在BRIGHT基准测试中实现了最先进的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代IR系统在处理复杂多面查询时的局限性：检索-重排序范式继承嵌入检索的局限；参数化生成方法难以更新新信息；长上下文方法在大文档集合中计算不可行。

Method: 包含两个阶段：(1)离线阶段通过自底向上聚合或自顶向下分割策略将语料库组织成语义层次结构；(2)在线遍历阶段，搜索LLM导航该树结构，使用遍历算法从局部LLM输出估计校准的潜在相关性分数并聚合为全局路径相关性度量。

Result: 在推理密集的BRIGHT基准测试中实现最先进的零样本性能，Recall@100提升9%，nDCG@10提升5%；与微调的SOTA方法DIVER-v2相比，在静态语料库评估的BRIGHT子集上获得可比结果。

Conclusion: LATTICE框架通过分层检索结构有效解决了LLM引导搜索中的挑战，在零样本设置下实现了优异的检索性能，为处理复杂查询提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern IR systems are increasingly tasked with answering complex,
multi-faceted queries that require deep reasoning rather than simple keyword or
semantic matching. While LLM-based IR has shown great promise, the prevailing
retrieve-then-rerank paradigm inherits the limitations of embedding-based
retrieval; parametric generative approaches are difficult to update with new
information; and long-context methods that place the entire corpus in context
are computationally infeasible for large document collections. To address these
challenges, we introduce LATTICE, a hierarchical retrieval framework that
enables an LLM to reason over and navigate large corpora with logarithmic
search complexity by imposing a semantic tree structure on the corpus. Our
approach consists of two stages: (1) an offline phase that organizes the corpus
into a semantic hierarchy via either a bottom-up agglomerative strategy or a
top-down divisive strategy using multi-level summaries and (2) an online
traversal phase where a search LLM navigates this tree. A central challenge in
such LLM-guided search is that the model's relevance judgments are noisy,
context-dependent, and unaware of the hierarchy, making cross-branch and
cross-level comparisons difficult. To overcome this, we propose a traversal
algorithm that estimates calibrated latent relevance scores from local LLM
outputs and aggregates them into a global path relevance metric. Our
training-free framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the
reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, demonstrating up to 9% improvement in
Recall@100 and 5% in nDCG@10 over the next best zero-shot baseline.
Furthermore, compared to the fine-tuned SOTA method DIVER-v2, LATTICE attains
comparable results on BRIGHT subsets that use a static corpus for evaluation.

Motivation: 在拥有数千万月活跃用户的大型电商平台上，推荐视觉相似产品对于帮助用户高效发现符合偏好的商品至关重要。

Method: 微调基于sigmoid对比损失的SigLIP视觉语言模型，使用Mercari三个月内收集的100万产品图像-标题对，开发用于推荐系统的图像编码器生成物品嵌入。

Result: 离线分析：nDCG@5相比基线提升9.1%；在线A/B测试：点击率提升50%，转化率提升14%。

Conclusion: 基于视觉语言模型的编码器在电商产品推荐中具有显著效果，为开发基于视觉相似性的推荐系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: On large-scale e-commerce platforms with tens of millions of active monthly
users, recommending visually similar products is essential for enabling users
to efficiently discover items that align with their preferences. This study
presents the application of a vision-language model (VLM) -- which has
demonstrated strong performance in image recognition and image-text retrieval
tasks -- to product recommendations on Mercari, a major consumer-to-consumer
marketplace used by more than 20 million monthly users in Japan. Specifically,
we fine-tuned SigLIP, a VLM employing a sigmoid-based contrastive loss, using
one million product image-title pairs from Mercari collected over a three-month
period, and developed an image encoder for generating item embeddings used in
the recommendation system. Our evaluation comprised an offline analysis of
historical interaction logs and an online A/B test in a production environment.
In offline analysis, the model achieved a 9.1% improvement in nDCG@5 compared
with the baseline. In the online A/B test, the click-through rate improved by
50% whereas the conversion rate improved by 14% compared with the existing
model. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of VLM-based encoders for
e-commerce product recommendations and provide practical insights into the
development of visual similarity-based recommendation systems.

Motivation: 传统拼车平台以利润为导向，忽视公平性和可持续性，导致城市交通拥堵和燃料消耗问题持续存在。

Method: 采用去中心化的点对点移动框架，参与者基于利他积分在司机和乘客角色间轮换；整合多智能体强化学习(MADDPG)进行动态拼车匹配，使用博弈论均衡保证公平性，并通过人口模型维持长期平衡。

Conclusion: ARS作为传统拼车的可扩展、社区驱动的替代方案，能够将个体行为与集体城市可持续性目标对齐。

Abstract: Urban mobility faces persistent challenges of congestion and fuel
consumption, specifically when people choose a private, point-to-point commute
option. Profit-driven ride-sharing platforms prioritize revenue over fairness
and sustainability. This paper introduces Altruistic Ride-Sharing (ARS), a
decentralized, peer-to-peer mobility framework where participants alternate
between driver and rider roles based on altruism points rather than monetary
incentives. The system integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MADDPG)
for dynamic ride-matching, game-theoretic equilibrium guarantees for fairness,
and a population model to sustain long-term balance. Using real-world New York
City taxi data, we demonstrate that ARS reduces travel distance and emissions,
increases vehicle utilization, and promotes equitable participation compared to
both no-sharing and optimization-based baselines. These results establish ARS
as a scalable, community-driven alternative to conventional ride-sharing,
aligning individual behavior with collective urban sustainability goals.

Motivation: 现有MARL模型虽然利用顺序决策过程提升性能，但没有显式考虑智能体决策顺序的重要性。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的actor-critic架构，动态调整智能体动作序列，引入预测下一个行动智能体的子任务，并与PPO损失函数协同优化。

Result: 在StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge和Multi-Agent MuJoCo基准测试中，AOAD-MAT模型优于现有的MAT和其他基线模型。

Conclusion: 调整智能体动作决策顺序在MARL中是有效的，AOAD-MAT模型通过显式学习最优智能体动作顺序显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning focuses on training the behaviors of
multiple learning agents that coexist in a shared environment. Recently, MARL
models, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep
Q-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging
sequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance
performance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in
which agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action
Decisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which
agents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence
of action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and
predict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a
Transformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the
sequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL
architecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next
agent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss
function to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential
decision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive
experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo
benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed AOAD-MAT model
outperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the
effectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL.

Abstract: Accessibility checkers are tools in support of accessible app development and
their use is encouraged by accessibility best practices. However, most current
checkers evaluate static or mechanically-generated contexts, failing to capture
common accessibility errors impacting mobile app functionality. We present
TaskAudit, an accessibility evaluation system that focuses on detecting
functiona11ity errors through simulated interactions. TaskAudit comprises three
components: a Task Generator that constructs interactive tasks from app
screens, a Task Executor that uses agents with a screen reader proxy to perform
these tasks, and an Accessibility Analyzer that detects and reports
accessibility errors by examining interaction traces. Evaluation on real-world
apps shows that our strategy detects 48 functiona11ity errors from 54 app
screens, compared to between 4 and 20 with existing checkers. Our analysis
demonstrates common error patterns that TaskAudit can detect in addition to
prior work, including label-functionality mismatch, cluttered navigation, and
inappropriate feedback.

Abstract: As virtual reality (VR) devices become increasingly integrated into everyday
settings, a growing number of users without prior experience will engage with
VR systems. Automatically detecting a user's familiarity with VR as an
interaction medium enables real-time, adaptive training and interface
adjustments, minimizing user frustration and improving task performance. In
this study, we explore the automatic detection of VR familiarity by analyzing
hand movement patterns during a passcode-based door-opening task, which is a
well-known interaction in collaborative virtual environments such as meeting
rooms, offices, and healthcare spaces. While novice users may lack prior VR
experience, they are likely to be familiar with analogous real-world tasks
involving keypad entry. We conducted a pilot study with 26 participants, evenly
split between experienced and inexperienced VR users, who performed tasks using
both controller-based and hand-tracking interactions. Our approach uses
state-of-the-art deep classifiers for automatic VR familiarity detection,
achieving the highest accuracies of 92.05% and 83.42% for hand-tracking and
controller-based interactions, respectively. In the cross-device evaluation,
where classifiers trained on controller data were tested using hand-tracking
data, the model achieved an accuracy of 78.89%. The integration of both
modalities in the mixed-device evaluation obtained an accuracy of 94.19%. Our
results underline the promise of using hand movement biometrics for the
real-time detection of user familiarity in critical VR applications, paving the
way for personalized and adaptive VR experiences.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时间使用VR会导致视觉疲劳，影响用户体验和安全性。现有疲劳检测方法依赖主观问卷或侵入式生理信号，限制了可扩展性和实时应用。

Method: 使用GazeBaseVR数据集（407名参与者的双眼眼动数据），提取单眼注视角度，评估六种深度分类器，其中EKYT表现最佳。

Result: EKYT在需要高视觉注意力的任务（如视频观看和文本阅读）中达到94%的准确率。眼动方差和主观疲劳测量显示疲劳与非疲劳状态存在显著行为差异。

Conclusion: 眼动动态是VR中连续疲劳检测的可靠非侵入式方法，为自适应人机交互提供实际应用价值。

Abstract: Prolonged exposure to virtual reality (VR) systems leads to visual fatigue,
impairs user comfort, performance, and safety, particularly in high-stakes or
long-duration applications. Existing fatigue detection approaches rely on
subjective questionnaires or intrusive physiological signals, such as EEG,
heart rate, or eye-blink count, which limit their scalability and real-time
applicability. This paper introduces a deep learning-based study for detecting
visual fatigue using continuous eye-gaze trajectories recorded in VR. We use
the GazeBaseVR dataset comprising binocular eye-tracking data from 407
participants across five immersive tasks, extract cyclopean eye-gaze angles,
and evaluate six deep classifiers. Our results demonstrate that EKYT achieves
up to 94% accuracy, particularly in tasks demanding high visual attention, such
as video viewing and text reading. We further analyze gaze variance and
subjective fatigue measures, indicating significant behavioral differences
between fatigued and non-fatigued conditions. These findings establish eye-gaze
dynamics as a reliable and nonintrusive modality for continuous fatigue
detection in immersive VR, offering practical implications for adaptive
human-computer interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法公平性研究忽视了重要维度：算法输出本身的证据价值是否依赖于结构性不公。作者旨在填补这一空白，为评估算法在执法等领域的道德可接受性提供新框架。

Method: 通过对比分析两个案例：基于历史犯罪数据的预测性警务算法和记录实时犯罪的摄像头系统，提出"邻近世界测试"来评估证据的道德可接受性。

Result: 预测性警务算法未能通过邻近世界测试，因为在不公较少的世界中其证据价值会消失；而摄像头系统通过了测试，其证据价值在不公较少的世界中仍然有效。

Conclusion: 未能通过邻近世界测试的证据在惩罚性使用中存在道德问题，这比通过测试的证据更具道德争议性。这一框架为评估算法公平性提供了重要补充维度。

Abstract: The growing philosophical literature on algorithmic fairness has examined
statistical criteria such as equalized odds and calibration, causal and
counterfactual approaches, and the role of structural and compounding
injustices. Yet an important dimension has been overlooked: whether the
evidential value of an algorithmic output itself depends on structural
injustice. Our paradigmatic pair of examples contrasts a predictive policing
algorithm, which relies on historical crime data, with a camera-based system
that records ongoing offenses, both designed to guide police deployment. In
evaluating the moral acceptability of acting on a piece of evidence, we must
ask not only whether the evidence is probative in the actual world, but also
whether it would remain probative in nearby worlds without the relevant
injustices. The predictive policing algorithm fails this test, but the
camera-based system passes it. When evidence fails the test, it is morally
problematic to use it punitively, more so than evidence that passes the test.

Motivation: 批判性思维是当今教育中的核心能力，但学习分析领域在定义、测量和支持批判性思维方面的工作有限，需要开发可扩展的评估方法。

Method: 基于已建立的技能进展开发编码规则，对学生的议论文进行人工编码，然后评估三种自动化评分方法：零样本提示、少样本提示和监督微调，使用GPT-5、GPT-5-mini和ModernBERT三个模型。

Result: GPT-5在少样本提示下表现最佳，在可分离、频繁出现的子技能类别上表现优异，但在需要检测细微差异或罕见类别的子技能上表现较差。

Conclusion: 自动批判性思维评估存在关键权衡：专有模型提供更高的可靠性但成本更高，开源替代方案提供实用准确性但对少数类别敏感性较低，这是迈向可扩展高阶推理技能评估的初步尝试。

Abstract: Critical thinking represents a fundamental competency in today's education
landscape. Developing critical thinking skills through timely assessment and
feedback is crucial; however, there has not been extensive work in the learning
analytics community on defining, measuring, and supporting critical thinking.
In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of measuring core "subskills"
that underlie critical thinking. We ground our work in an authentic task where
students operationalize critical thinking: student-written argumentative
essays. We developed a coding rubric based on an established skills progression
and completed human coding for a corpus of student essays. We then evaluated
three distinct approaches to automated scoring: zero-shot prompting, few-shot
prompting, and supervised fine-tuning, implemented across three large language
models (GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and ModernBERT). GPT-5 with few-shot prompting
achieved the strongest results and demonstrated particular strength on
subskills with separable, frequent categories, while lower performance was
observed for subskills that required detection of subtle distinctions or rare
categories. Our results underscore critical trade-offs in automated critical
thinking assessment: proprietary models offer superior reliability at higher
cost, while open-source alternatives provide practical accuracy with reduced
sensitivity to minority categories. Our work represents an initial step toward
scalable assessment of higher-order reasoning skills across authentic
educational contexts.

TL;DR: 提出HyWA-PVAD方法，使用超网络修改标准VAD模型的部分层权重，实现个性化语音活动检测，无需改变VAD架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PVAD方法需要架构修改（如FiLM层），而本方法旨在通过超网络实现说话人条件化，保持VAD架构不变，便于部署。

Method: 使用超网络修改标准VAD模型中选定层的权重，使同一VAD模型能适应不同说话人，仅更新少量层。

Result: 相比多种基线条件化技术，HyWA-PVAD在PVAD性能上持续提升，提高了平均精度均值。

Conclusion: HyWA-PVAD在提升性能的同时简化了部署，可重用相同的VAD架构，优于现有条件化技术。

Abstract: Personalized Voice Activity Detection (PVAD) systems activate only in
response to a specific target speaker by incorporating speaker embeddings from
enrollment utterances. Unlike existing methods that require architectural
changes, such as FiLM layers, our approach employs a hypernetwork to modify the
weights of a few selected layers within a standard voice activity detection
(VAD) model. This enables speaker conditioning without changing the VAD
architecture, allowing the same VAD model to adapt to different speakers by
updating only a small subset of the layers. We propose HyWA-PVAD, a
hypernetwork weight adaptation method, and evaluate it against multiple
baseline conditioning techniques. Our comparison shows consistent improvements
in PVAD performance. HyWA also offers practical advantages for deployment by
preserving the core VAD architecture. Our new approach improves the current
conditioning techniques in two ways: i) increases the mean average precision,
ii) simplifies deployment by reusing the same VAD architecture.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了DualHyp框架，通过大型语言模型融合ASR和VSR的N-best假设，结合RelPrompt机制动态调整模态权重，在音频-视觉语音识别中实现显著错误率降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统单流生成式错误校正方法在音频-视觉语音识别中效果有限的问题，充分利用多模态证据进行更有效的错误校正。

Method: DualHyp框架让LLM组合独立的ASR和VSR N-best假设，RelPrompt提供模态可靠性指导，动态切换ASR和VSR假设焦点。

Result: 在LRS2基准测试中，相比标准ASR基线获得57.7%错误率增益，远超单流GER方法10%的增益。

Conclusion: DualHyp框架在多种噪声场景下显著提升AVSR性能，证明了多模态融合在语音识别错误校正中的有效性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new paradigm for generative error correction (GER)
framework in audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) that reasons over
modality-specific evidences directly in the language space. Our framework,
DualHyp, empowers a large language model (LLM) to compose independent N-best
hypotheses from separate automatic speech recognition (ASR) and visual speech
recognition (VSR) models. To maximize the effectiveness of DualHyp, we further
introduce RelPrompt, a noise-aware guidance mechanism that provides
modality-grounded prompts to the LLM. RelPrompt offers the temporal reliability
of each modality stream, guiding the model to dynamically switch its focus
between ASR and VSR hypotheses for an accurate correction. Under various
corruption scenarios, our framework attains up to 57.7% error rate gain on the
LRS2 benchmark over standard ASR baseline, contrary to single-stream GER
approaches that achieve only 10% gain. To facilitate research within our
DualHyp framework, we release the code and the dataset comprising ASR and VSR
hypotheses at https://github.com/sungnyun/dualhyp.

Conclusion: 该方法为恒星器优化和更复杂偏微分方程求解提供了新的数值工具，能够处理连续分布的磁流体平衡问题。

Abstract: Numerical computation of the ideal Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium
magnetic field is at the base of stellarator optimisation and provides the
starting point for solving more sophisticated Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs) like transport or turbulence models. Conventional approaches solve for a
single stationary point of the ideal MHD equations, which is fully defined by
three invariants and the numerical scheme employed by the solver. We present
the first numerical approach that can solve for a continuous distribution of
equilibria with fixed boundary and rotational transform, varying only the
pressure invariant. This approach minimises the force residual by optimising
parameters of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) that map from a scalar pressure
multiplier to the Fourier Zernike basis as implemented in the modern
stellarator equilibrium solver DESC.

TL;DR: 本文证明了Tyler的M估计器在椭圆分布下的最优样本阈值和误差界，完全匹配高斯分布的结果，并恢复了算法收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 椭圆分布的形状矩阵估计是统计学中的基本问题，现有方法在有限样本设置下存在log²d因子的样本复杂度差距。

Method: 基于Franks和Moitra的算子缩放连接，引入新的伪随机条件∞-expansion，证明椭圆分布满足该条件，并开发新的缩放结果。

Conclusion: 本文填补了椭圆分布形状矩阵估计的样本复杂度差距，为Tyler的M估计器提供了最优的理论保证。

Abstract: A fundamental problem in statistics is estimating the shape matrix of an
Elliptical distribution. This generalizes the familiar problem of Gaussian
covariance estimation, for which the sample covariance achieves optimal
estimation error. For Elliptical distributions, Tyler proposed a natural
M-estimator and showed strong statistical properties in the asymptotic regime,
independent of the underlying distribution. Numerical experiments show that
this estimator performs very well, and that Tyler's iterative procedure
converges quickly to the estimator. Franks and Moitra recently provided the
first distribution-free error bounds in the finite sample setting, as well as
the first rigorous convergence analysis of Tyler's iterative procedure.
However, their results exceed the sample complexity of the Gaussian setting by
a $\log^{2} d$ factor. We close this gap by proving optimal sample threshold
and error bounds for Tyler's M-estimator for all Elliptical distributions,
fully matching the Gaussian result. Moreover, we recover the algorithmic
convergence even at this lower sample threshold. Our approach builds on the
operator scaling connection of Franks and Moitra by introducing a novel
pseudorandom condition, which we call $\infty$-expansion. We show that
Elliptical distributions satisfy $\infty$-expansion at the optimal sample
threshold, and then prove a novel scaling result for inputs satisfying this
condition.

TL;DR: 提出了Latent Interacting Particle Systems模型，通过参数化马尔可夫链的生成器，结合前瞻函数和扭曲序贯蒙特卡洛采样，解决高维交互连续时间马尔可夫链系统的后验推断难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交互连续时间马尔可夫链系统是强大的模型类别，但在高维设置下推断通常难以处理。离散时间的辅助信息需要通过Doob's h-变换处理，导致难以处理的后验过程需要近似。

Method: 引入Latent Interacting Particle Systems模型类，参数化系统中每个马尔可夫链的生成器。推断方法包括估计预测未来信息的前瞻函数（扭曲势能），并引入高效参数化。将这种近似结合到扭曲序贯蒙特卡洛采样方案中。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效处理高维交互连续时间马尔可夫链系统的后验推断问题，在复杂任务中表现出良好性能。

Abstract: Systems of interacting continuous-time Markov chains are a powerful model
class, but inference is typically intractable in high dimensional settings.
Auxiliary information, such as noisy observations, is typically only available
at discrete times, and incorporating it via a Doob's $h-$transform gives rise
to an intractable posterior process that requires approximation. We introduce
Latent Interacting Particle Systems, a model class parameterizing the generator
of each Markov chain in the system. Our inference method involves estimating
look-ahead functions (twist potentials) that anticipate future information, for
which we introduce an efficient parameterization. We incorporate this
approximation in a twisted Sequential Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a challenging posterior
inference task for a latent SIRS model on a graph, and on a neural model for
wildfire spread dynamics trained on real data.

Motivation: 传统概率图模型(PGMs)只能处理成对交互，无法建模更高阶的统计依赖关系。为了在复杂系统中建模多层次的拓扑结构，需要扩展PGMs到单纯复形。

Method: 基于离散霍奇理论，构建了单纯形高斯模型(SGM)，在单一参数化高斯分布中联合建模顶点、边和三角形上的随机变量。开发了最大似然推断算法来恢复完整SGM的参数和条件依赖结构。

Result: 在不同规模和稀疏度的合成单纯复形上的数值实验验证了算法的有效性，能够成功恢复模型的参数和依赖结构。

Conclusion: SGM成功扩展了高斯概率图模型到单纯复形，为建模多层次拓扑结构中的统计依赖提供了有效工具，突破了传统成对交互的限制。

Abstract: Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are powerful tools for representing
statistical dependencies through graphs in high-dimensional systems. However,
they are limited to pairwise interactions. In this work, we propose the
simplicial Gaussian model (SGM), which extends Gaussian PGM to simplicial
complexes. SGM jointly models random variables supported on vertices, edges,
and triangles, within a single parametrized Gaussian distribution. Our model
builds upon discrete Hodge theory and incorporates uncertainty at every
topological level through independent random components. Motivated by
applications, we focus on the marginal edge-level distribution while treating
node- and triangle-level variables as latent. We then develop a
maximum-likelihood inference algorithm to recover the parameters of the full
SGM and the induced conditional dependence structure. Numerical experiments on
synthetic simplicial complexes with varying size and sparsity confirm the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

Motivation: 现有方法需要已知有限的标签空间和随机样本分割，但在遇到新标签时无法提供足够的覆盖率，在预测已见标签时可能过于保守。

Method: 计算并整合新的保形p值来测试新数据点是否属于未见类别，开发了基于标签频率的选择性样本分割算法，通过重新加权保持有限样本保证。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据中，该方法在具有无限可能标签的开放集场景下仍能保持有效的预测集覆盖率，在极端类别不平衡下产生更具信息量的预测。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了开放集和高度不平衡分类中的保形预测问题，提供了理论保证和实际有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a conformal prediction method for classification in
highly imbalanced and open-set settings, where there are many possible classes
and not all may be represented in the data. Existing approaches require a
finite, known label space and typically involve random sample splitting, which
works well when there is a sufficient number of observations from each class.
Consequently, they have two limitations: (i) they fail to provide adequate
coverage when encountering new labels at test time, and (ii) they may become
overly conservative when predicting previously seen labels. To obtain valid
prediction sets in the presence of unseen labels, we compute and integrate into
our predictions a new family of conformal p-values that can test whether a new
data point belongs to a previously unseen class. We study these p-values
theoretically, establishing their optimality, and uncover an intriguing
connection with the classical Good--Turing estimator for the probability of
observing a new species. To make more efficient use of imbalanced data, we also
develop a selective sample splitting algorithm that partitions training and
calibration data based on label frequency, leading to more informative
predictions. Despite breaking exchangeability, this allows maintaining
finite-sample guarantees through suitable re-weighting. With both simulated and
real data, we demonstrate our method leads to prediction sets with valid
coverage even in challenging open-set scenarios with infinite numbers of
possible labels, and produces more informative predictions under extreme class
imbalance.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了从传统概率视角向信息论框架的范式转变，通过语义惊喜向量量化新样本的语义意外程度，解决了现有OOD检测方法无法区分近OOD和远OOD的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法将问题简化为二分类，无法区分语义相近和语义遥远的未知风险，这在需要细粒度风险分层的应用中构成了安全瓶颈。

Method: 构建低熵语义流形来反映数据的内在语义层次结构，设计分层原型网络，引入语义惊喜向量将样本的总意外分解为三个可解释维度：一致性、新颖性和模糊性。

Result: 在挑战性的三元分类任务上建立了新的SOTA，其鲁棒表示在传统二元基准测试中也取得了顶尖结果，在LSUN等数据集上将误报率降低了60%以上。

Conclusion: 该信息论框架不仅为细粒度OOD检测提供了新范式，其通用性和可解释性也为AI系统的安全部署提供了更可靠的保障。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is a cornerstone for the safe deployment
of AI systems in the open world. However, existing methods treat OOD detection
as a binary classification problem, a cognitive flattening that fails to
distinguish between semantically close (Near-OOD) and distant (Far-OOD) unknown
risks. This limitation poses a significant safety bottleneck in applications
requiring fine-grained risk stratification. To address this, we propose a
paradigm shift from a conventional probabilistic view to a principled
information-theoretic framework. We formalize the core task as quantifying the
Semantic Surprise of a new sample and introduce a novel ternary classification
challenge: In-Distribution (ID) vs. Near-OOD vs. Far-OOD. The theoretical
foundation of our work is the concept of Low-Entropy Semantic Manifolds, which
are explicitly structured to reflect the data's intrinsic semantic hierarchy.
To construct these manifolds, we design a Hierarchical Prototypical Network. We
then introduce the Semantic Surprise Vector (SSV), a universal probe that
decomposes a sample's total surprise into three complementary and interpretable
dimensions: conformity, novelty, and ambiguity. To evaluate performance on this
new task, we propose the Normalized Semantic Risk (nSR), a cost-sensitive
metric. Experiments demonstrate that our framework not only establishes a new
state-of-the-art (sota) on the challenging ternary task, but its robust
representations also achieve top results on conventional binary benchmarks,
reducing the False Positive Rate by over 60% on datasets like LSUN.

Conclusion: ε-高斯可认证性克服了先前ε-可认证性的次优性，使得单步方法成为可能，揭示了概念选择对算法效率的关键影响。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to efficiently remove the influence of selected data
while preserving generalization. Significant progress has been made in low
dimensions $(p \ll n)$, but high dimensions pose serious theoretical challenges
as standard optimization assumptions of $\Omega(1)$ strong convexity and $O(1)$
smoothness of the per-example loss $f$ rarely hold simultaneously in
proportional regimes $(p\sim n)$. In this work, we introduce
$\varepsilon$-Gaussian certifiability, a canonical and robust notion
well-suited to high-dimensional regimes, that optimally captures a broad class
of noise adding mechanisms. Then we theoretically analyze the performance of a
widely used unlearning algorithm based on one step of the Newton method in the
high-dimensional setting described above. Our analysis shows that a single
Newton step, followed by a well-calibrated Gaussian noise, is sufficient to
achieve both privacy and accuracy in this setting. This result stands in sharp
contrast to the only prior work that analyzes machine unlearning in high
dimensions \citet{zou2025certified}, which relaxes some of the standard
optimization assumptions for high-dimensional applicability, but operates under
the notion of $\varepsilon$-certifiability. That work concludes %that a single
Newton step is insufficient even for removing a single data point, and that at
least two steps are required to ensure both privacy and accuracy. Our result
leads us to conclude that the discrepancy in the number of steps arises because
of the sub optimality of the notion of $\varepsilon$-certifiability and its
incompatibility with noise adding mechanisms, which $\varepsilon$-Gaussian
certifiability is able to overcome optimally.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前的研究已经建立了对比散度算法在指数族分布下的渐近收敛性，但其收敛率为O(n^{-1/3})，作者希望证明CD算法实际上可以达到更快的参数率O(n^{-1/2})。

Method: 采用非渐近分析方法，在不同数据批处理方案（包括完全在线和小批量）下分析对比散度算法的收敛性能。

Result: 在正则性假设下，CD算法可以达到参数率O(n^{-1/2})，并且其渐近方差接近Cramér-Rao下界，表明CD算法接近最优。

Conclusion: 对比散度算法不仅具有理论上的最优性，在实际应用中也能达到参数收敛率，为未归一化模型的训练提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We perform a non-asymptotic analysis of the contrastive divergence (CD)
algorithm, a training method for unnormalized models. While prior work has
established that (for exponential family distributions) the CD iterates
asymptotically converge at an $O(n^{-1 / 3})$ rate to the true parameter of the
data distribution, we show, under some regularity assumptions, that CD can
achieve the parametric rate $O(n^{-1 / 2})$. Our analysis provides results for
various data batching schemes, including the fully online and minibatch ones.
We additionally show that CD can be near-optimal, in the sense that its
asymptotic variance is close to the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound.

Method: 开发鲁棒极小极大提升方法，最小化最坏情况错误概率，对一般类型标签噪声具有鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明RMBoost不仅对标签噪声具有弹性，还能提供强大的分类准确率。

Conclusion: RMBoost方法在标签噪声环境下具有鲁棒性，同时保持高分类准确率，并提供了有限样本下的性能保证。

Abstract: Boosting methods often achieve excellent classification accuracy, but can
experience notable performance degradation in the presence of label noise.
Existing robust methods for boosting provide theoretical robustness guarantees
for certain types of label noise, and can exhibit only moderate performance
degradation. However, previous theoretical results do not account for realistic
types of noise and finite training sizes, and existing robust methods can
provide unsatisfactory accuracies, even without noise. This paper presents
methods for robust minimax boosting (RMBoost) that minimize worst-case error
probabilities and are robust to general types of label noise. In addition, we
provide finite-sample performance guarantees for RMBoost with respect to the
error obtained without noise and with respect to the best possible error (Bayes
risk). The experimental results corroborate that RMBoost is not only resilient
to label noise but can also provide strong classification accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从独立同分布观测数据进行因果发现通常是病态的。本文旨在证明，在获得结构因果模型分布和来自两个噪声统计不同环境的额外数据时，可以解决这一识别问题。

Method: 利用结构因果模型的分布和来自两个噪声统计充分不同环境的数据。该方法基于非线性独立成分分析（ICA）与因果发现之间的对偶关系，但需要的辅助信息更少。

Result: 证明了在仅有两个环境且噪声为高斯分布的条件下，可以唯一识别整个因果图。这是首个在恒定环境数量和任意非线性机制下保证因果图恢复的结果。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了ICA与因果发现的对偶关系，展示了在较少辅助信息下实现因果发现的可能性。虽然当前约束是噪声的高斯性，但提出了放松这一要求的潜在方法。

Abstract: Causal discovery from i.i.d. observational data is known to be generally
ill-posed. We demonstrate that if we have access to the distribution of a
structural causal model, and additional data from only two environments that
sufficiently differ in the noise statistics, the unique causal graph is
identifiable. Notably, this is the first result in the literature that
guarantees the entire causal graph recovery with a constant number of
environments and arbitrary nonlinear mechanisms. Our only constraint is the
Gaussianity of the noise terms; however, we propose potential ways to relax
this requirement. Of interest on its own, we expand on the well-known duality
between independent component analysis (ICA) and causal discovery; recent
advancements have shown that nonlinear ICA can be solved from multiple
environments, at least as many as the number of sources: we show that the same
can be achieved for causal discovery while having access to much less auxiliary
information.

Abstract: Amortized simulator-based inference offers a powerful framework for tackling
Bayesian inference in computational fields such as engineering or neuroscience,
increasingly leveraging modern generative methods like diffusion models to map
observed data to model parameters or future predictions. These approaches yield
posterior or posterior-predictive samples for new datasets without requiring
further simulator calls after training on simulated parameter-data pairs.
However, their applicability is often limited by the prior distribution(s) used
to generate model parameters during this training phase. To overcome this
constraint, we introduce PriorGuide, a technique specifically designed for
diffusion-based amortized inference methods. PriorGuide leverages a novel
guidance approximation that enables flexible adaptation of the trained
diffusion model to new priors at test time, crucially without costly
retraining. This allows users to readily incorporate updated information or
expert knowledge post-training, enhancing the versatility of pre-trained
inference models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器学习原子间势能模型在处理局部和半局部相互作用方面表现出色，但在需要显式和高效处理长程相互作用时往往不足，如静电和色散相互作用。

Method: 将线性扩展的注意力机制映射到傅里叶空间，可以与任何现有的局部或半局部MLIP框架集成，无需依赖预定义的电荷或其他经验假设。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，包括二聚体结合曲线、色散主导的层状磷烯剥离和体相水的分子偶极密度，RSA作为MACE骨干网络的长程修正表现出色。

Conclusion: RSA能够一致地捕捉广泛化学和材料系统中的长程物理现象，有效解决了现有MLIP模型在长程相互作用处理上的局限性。

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized the
modeling of materials and molecules by directly fitting to ab initio data.
However, while these models excel at capturing local and semi-local
interactions, they often prove insufficient when an explicit and efficient
treatment of long-range interactions is required. To address this limitation,
we introduce Reciprocal-Space Attention (RSA), a framework designed to capture
long-range interactions in the Fourier domain. RSA can be integrated with any
existing local or semi-local MLIP framework. The central contribution of this
work is the mapping of a linear-scaling attention mechanism into Fourier space,
enabling the explicit modeling of long-range interactions such as
electrostatics and dispersion without relying on predefined charges or other
empirical assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as a
long-range correction to the MACE backbone across diverse benchmarks, including
dimer binding curves, dispersion-dominated layered phosphorene exfoliation, and
the molecular dipole density of bulk water. Our results show that RSA
consistently captures long-range physics across a broad range of chemical and
materials systems. The code and datasets for this work is available at

TL;DR: 提出自适应向量转向(AVS)方法，通过探测模型内部状态来减少音频大语言模型的幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频-语言模型和多模态大语言模型在音频问答等任务中表现出色，但存在对音频内容产生幻觉的问题，需要解决这种幻觉现象。

Method: 提出自适应向量转向(AVS)方法，通过分析模型内部状态表示，使生成内容更好地基于音频内容，利用输出正确性与内部表示之间的强相关性。

Result: 在Audio Hallucination QA数据集上，Gemma的F1分数从0.550提升到0.619，Qwen从0.626提升到0.632；在MMAU上，Qwen的准确率从0.548提升到0.592，相对提升8%。

Conclusion: 这是首个将向量转向技术应用于缓解音频幻觉的工作，实验证明该方法在两个模型和两个基准测试中均取得一致的性能提升。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models and Multi-Modal Large Language Models have
demonstrated strong capabilities in tasks such as Audio Question Answering
(AQA), Audio Captioning, and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, there
is growing evidence that these models can hallucinate about the content of the
audio. To address this issue, we probe the models' internal states and propose
Adaptive Vector Steering (AVS), a method that better grounds generation in
audio content. We also identify a strong correlation between output correctness
and internal representations. Experiments show consistent performance gains
across two models and two benchmarks. On the Audio Hallucination QA dataset,
our method boosts the F1-score of Gemma from 0.550 to 0.619 and Qwen from 0.626
to 0.632. Furthermore, our method increases the accuracy of Qwen on MMAU from
0.548 to 0.592, marking an 8% relative increase. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to apply vector steering to mitigate hallucination in
audio.
