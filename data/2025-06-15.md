### [1] [GPU Acceleration of SQL Analytics on Compressed Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10092)
*Zezhou Huang,Krystian Sakowski,Hans Lehnert,Wei Cui,Carlo Curino,Matteo Interlandi,Marius Dumitru,Rathijit Sen*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种直接在轻量压缩数据上运行查询的新方法，解决了GPU内存不足的问题，实现了比现有CPU系统快一个数量级的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU内存较小，无法处理大规模数据集，现有解决方案（如数据分区或混合执行）存在带宽和成本限制，需要一种直接在压缩数据上操作的方法。

Method: 采用轻量压缩方案（如RLE、字典编码等），直接在压缩数据上运行查询，支持多列RLE操作和异构列编码，并利用PyTorch张量操作实现跨设备兼容。

Result: 实验表明，在无法放入GPU内存的生产数据集上，该方法比现有CPU系统快一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法为GPU在更广泛场景中的应用铺平了道路，并与其他扩展或回退机制互补。

Abstract: GPUs are uniquely suited to accelerate (SQL) analytics workloads thanks to
their massive compute parallelism and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) -- when
datasets fit in the GPU HBM, performance is unparalleled. Unfortunately, GPU
HBMs remain typically small when compared with lower-bandwidth CPU main memory.
Besides brute-force scaling across many GPUs, current solutions to accelerate
queries on large datasets include leveraging data partitioning and loading
smaller data batches in GPU HBM, and hybrid execution with a connected device
(e.g., CPUs). Unfortunately, these approaches are exposed to the limitations of
lower main memory and host-to-device interconnect bandwidths, introduce
additional I/O overheads, or incur higher costs. This is a substantial problem
when trying to scale adoption of GPUs on larger datasets. Data compression can
alleviate this bottleneck, but to avoid paying for costly
decompression/decoding, an ideal solution must include computation primitives
to operate directly on data in compressed form.
  This is the focus of our paper: a set of new methods for running queries
directly on light-weight compressed data using schemes such as Run-Length
Encoding (RLE), index encoding, bit-width reductions, and dictionary encoding.
Our novelty includes operating on multiple RLE columns without decompression,
handling heterogeneous column encodings, and leveraging PyTorch tensor
operations for portability across devices. Experimental evaluations show
speedups of an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art commercial
CPU-only analytics systems, for real-world queries on a production dataset that
would not fit into GPU memory uncompressed. This work paves the road for GPU
adoption in a much broader set of use cases, and it is complementary to most
other scale-out or fallback mechanisms.

### [2] [A Unifying Algorithm for Hierarchical Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10238)
*Mahmoud Abo Khamis,Jesse Comer,Phokion Kolaitis,Sudeepa Roy,Val Tannen*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文研究了层次查询在三个问题（概率查询评估、Shapley值计算和bag-set最大化）中的边界作用，并提出了一个统一的2-monoid多项式时间算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨层次查询在SJF-BCQ中的边界作用，以及如何通过统一算法解决三个不同问题。

Method: 提出基于2-monoid的抽象代数结构，针对每个问题定制不同的实例化。

Result: 证明非层次查询的bag-set最大化问题是NP完全的，而层次查询的三个问题均可通过2-monoid算法高效解决。

Conclusion: 层次查询定义了三个问题的可解性边界，2-monoid算法为这些问题的统一解决提供了框架。

Abstract: The class of hierarchical queries is known to define the boundary of the
dichotomy between tractability and intractability for the following two
extensively studied problems about self-join free Boolean conjunctive queries
(SJF-BCQ): (i) evaluating a SJF-BCQ on a tuple-independent probabilistic
database; (ii) computing the Shapley value of a fact in a database on which a
SJF-BCQ evaluates to true. Here, we establish that hierarchical queries define
also the boundary of the dichotomy between tractability and intractability for
a different natural algorithmic problem, which we call the "bag-set
maximization" problem. The bag-set maximization problem associated with a
SJF-BCQ $Q$ asks: given a database $\cal D$, find the biggest value that $Q$
takes under bag semantics on a database $\cal D'$ obtained from $\cal D$ by
adding at most $\theta$ facts from another given database $\cal D^r$.
  For non-hierarchical queries, we show that the bag-set maximization problem
is an NP-complete optimization problem. More significantly, for hierarchical
queries, we show that all three aforementioned problems (probabilistic query
evaluation, Shapley value computation, and bag-set maximization) admit a single
unifying polynomial-time algorithm that operates on an abstract algebraic
structure, called a "2-monoid". Each of the three problems requires a different
instantiation of the 2-monoid tailored for the problem at hand.

### [3] [A Hybrid Heuristic Framework for Resource-Efficient Querying of Scientific Experiments Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10422)
*Mayank Patel,Minal Bhise*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级资源感知混合框架（RAW-HF），通过高效利用有限资源优化原始数据查询，显著减少执行时间和资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据库管理系统和HTAP系统在查询前需加载整个数据集，而原位引擎可能多次解析数据，导致资源浪费和成本增加。资源分配不当也增加了应用运行成本。

Method: RAW-HF通过优化资源分配和最大化现有资源利用率，设计了模块来减少工作负载执行时间和资源消耗。

Result: 在SDSS和LOD数据集上，RAW-HF比PostgreSQL减少了90%和85%的工作负载执行时间，CPU、IO资源利用率和WET分别降低了26%、25%和26%，内存利用率提高了33%。

Conclusion: RAW-HF在资源利用和工作负载执行时间方面优于传统方法和现有混合系统技术，展示了其高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Scientific experiments and modern applications are generating large amounts
of data every day. Most organizations utilize In-house servers or Cloud
resources to manage application data and workload. The traditional database
management system (DBMS) and HTAP systems spend significant time & resources to
load the entire dataset into DBMS before starting query execution. On the other
hand, in-situ engines may reparse required data multiple times, increasing
resource utilization and data processing costs. Additionally, over or
under-allocation of resources also increases application running costs. This
paper proposes a lightweight Resource Availability &Workload aware Hybrid
Framework (RAW-HF) to optimize querying raw data by utilizing existing finite
resources efficiently. RAW-HF includes modules that help optimize the resources
required to execute a given workload and maximize the utilization of existing
resources. The impact of applying RAW-HF to real-world scientific dataset
workloads like Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Linked Observation Data
(LOD) presented over 90% and 85% reduction in workload execution time (WET)
compared to widely used traditional DBMS PostgreSQL. The overall CPU, IO
resource utilization, and WET have been reduced by 26%, 25%, and 26%,
respectively, while improving memory utilization by 33%, compared to the
state-of-the-art workload-aware partial loading technique (WA) proposed for
hybrid systems. A comparison of MUAR technique used by RAW-HF with machine
learning based resource allocation techniques like PCC is also presented.

### [5] [Resilience through Automated Adaptive Configuration for Distribution and Replication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10248)
*Scott D. Stoller,Balaji Jayasankar,Yanhong A. Liu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化框架，通过优化自适应分布和复制软件组件，使复杂系统在故障下保持弹性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂系统在异构硬件环境中因故障导致的弹性问题。

Method: 基于状态空间探索的模型查找算法，结合等价关系优化，生成初始弹性配置和重配置策略。

Result: 成功应用于自动驾驶系统模型，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够显著提升复杂系统在故障下的弹性。

Abstract: This paper presents a powerful automated framework for making complex systems
resilient under failures, by optimized adaptive distribution and replication of
interdependent software components across heterogeneous hardware components
with widely varying capabilities. A configuration specifies how software is
distributed and replicated: which software components to run on each computer,
which software components to replicate, which replication protocols to use,
etc. We present an algorithm that, given a system model and resilience
requirements, (1) determines initial configurations of the system that are
resilient, and (2) generates a reconfiguration policy that determines
reconfiguration actions to execute in response to failures and recoveries. This
model-finding algorithm is based on state-space exploration and incorporates
powerful optimizations, including a quotient reduction based on a novel
equivalence relation between states. We present experimental results from
successfully applying a prototype implementation of our framework to a model of
an autonomous driving system.

Method: 比较不同重排序策略在多种CPU上的表现，包括顺序和并行执行，并分析测量方法、策略差异、机器一致性及负载不均衡的影响。

Result: 重排序能显著提升性能，但具体效果因CPU和策略而异。

Conclusion: 稀疏矩阵重排序是提升稀疏矩阵-向量乘法性能的有效方法，但需根据具体硬件和策略优化。

Abstract: This work evaluates the impact of sparse matrix reordering on the performance
of sparse matrix-vector multiplication across different multicore CPU
platforms. Reordering can significantly enhance performance by optimizing the
non-zero element patterns to reduce total data movement and improve the
load-balancing. We examine how these gains vary over different CPUs for
different reordering strategies, focusing on both sequential and parallel
execution. We address multiple aspects, including appropriate measurement
methodology, comparison across different kinds of reordering strategies,
consistency across machines, and impact of load imbalance.

### [7] [HPCTransCompile: An AI Compiler Generated Dataset for High-Performance CUDA Transpilation and LLM Preliminary Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10401)

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用AI编译器和自动优化技术生成高性能CUDA代码及其对应平台代码的新框架，并通过图数据增强方法和HPCTransEval基准测试提升LLM在CUDA转译中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CUDA代码转译到其他硬件平台时的性能可移植性问题，以及现有方法在通用性和开发成本上的局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为CUDA代码转译提供了高效解决方案，并展示了LLM在高性能计算领域的应用前景。

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在保护数据隐私的同时实现分布式客户端的协作模型训练，但优化能源效率和模型精度仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用双层整数线性规划（ILP）公式，结合近似Shapley值和能量-时间预测模型，提出FedJoule框架。

Result: FedJoule在多样能量预算、非独立同分布数据和实际配置下，比现有方法在精度和时间上分别提升15%和48%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现了能源使用与性能之间的可行权衡。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, optimizing both
energy efficiency and model accuracy remains a challenge, given device and data
heterogeneity. Further, sustainable AI through a global energy budget for FL
has not been explored. We propose a novel optimization problem for client
selection in FL that maximizes the model accuracy within an overall energy
limit and reduces training time. We solve this with a unique bi-level ILP
formulation that leverages approximate Shapley values and energy-time
prediction models to efficiently solve this. Our FedJoule framework achieves
superior training accuracies compared to SOTA and simple baselines for diverse
energy budgets, non-IID distributions, and realistic experiment configurations,
performing 15% and 48% better on accuracy and time, respectively. The results
highlight the effectiveness of our method in achieving a viable trade-off
between energy usage and performance in FL environments.

### [9] [Automating Multi-Tenancy Performance Evaluation on Edge Compute Nodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10461)

Result: 通过案例驱动分析，揭示了多租户对不同硬件配置和多样化工作负载的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为边缘计算环境中的多租户性能分析提供了高效解决方案，并公开了实现代码和工作负载。

Abstract: Edge Computing emerges as a promising alternative of Cloud Computing, with
scalable compute resources and services deployed in the path between IoT
devices and Cloud. Since virtualization techniques can be applied on Edge
compute nodes, administrators can share their Edge infrastructures among
multiple users, providing the so-called multi-tenancy. Even though
multi-tenancy is unavoidable, it raises concerns about security and performance
degradation due to resource contention in Edge Computing. For that,
administrators need to deploy services with non-antagonizing profiles and
explore workload co-location scenarios to enhance performance and energy
consumption. Achieving this, however, requires extensive configuration,
deployment, iterative testing, and analysis, an effort-intensive and
time-consuming process. To address this challenge, we introduce an
auto-benchmarking framework designed to streamline the analysis of
multi-tenancy performance in Edge environments. Our framework includes a
built-in monitoring stack and integrates with widely used benchmarking
workloads, such as streaming analytics, database operations, machine learning
applications, and component-based stress testing. We perform a case-driven
analysis and provide valuable insights into the impact of multi-tenancy on Edge
environments with different hardware configurations and diverse workloads.
Finally, the implementation of our framework, along with the containerized
workloads used for experimentation, is publicly available.

### [10] [TD-Pipe: Temporally-Disaggregated Pipeline Parallelism Architecture for High-Throughput LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10470)
*Hongbin Zhang,Taosheng Wei,Zhenyi Zheng,Jiangsu Du,Zhiguang Chen,Yutong Lu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: TD-Pipe是一种新型的管道并行架构，通过时间解耦预填充和解码阶段，显著提升LLM推理的吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型规模增大，管道并行在LLM推理中展现出潜力，但预填充和解码阶段的不均衡负载和复杂数据依赖导致性能下降。

Method: 提出TD-Pipe架构，采用层次控制器结构、AI驱动的贪婪预填充、批间工作窃取和时空强度比较方法。

Result: 实验表明，TD-Pipe在仅PCIe互连的GPU节点上，吞吐量比现有方法提升最高达1.91倍和2.73倍。

Conclusion: TD-Pipe通过时间解耦和动态优化，有效解决了管道并行中的性能瓶颈，显著提升了LLM推理效率。

Abstract: As the model size continuously increases, pipeline parallelism shows great
promise in throughput-oriented LLM inference due to its low demand on
communications. However, imbalanced pipeline workloads and complex data
dependencies in the prefill and decode phases result in massive pipeline
bubbles and further severe performance reduction. To better exploit the
pipeline parallelism for high-throughput LLM inference, we propose TD-Pipe,
with the key idea lies in the temporally-disaggregated pipeline parallelism
architecture. Specifically, this architecture disaggregates the prefill and
decode phases in the temporal dimension, so as to eliminate pipeline bubbles
caused by the phase switching. TD-Pipe identifies potential issues of
exploiting the novel architecture and provides solutions. First, a
hierarchy-controller structure is used to better coordinate devices in pipeline
parallelism by decoupling the scheduling from execution. Second, the AI-based
greedy prefill approach aggressively performs more prefills by predicting the
output length and simulating the memory usage. Third, the inter-batch work
stealing approach dynamically balances decode phase workloads between different
batches to reduce bubbles. Forth, the spatial-temporal intensity comparison
approach determines the optimal switch from decode to prefill by comparing the
performance drop from reduced computational intensity with that from phase
switching bubbles. Extensive experiments show that TD-Pipe effectively
increases the throughput of LLM inference by up to 1.91x over the existing
tensor parallel approach and 2.73x over the existing pipeline parallel approach
on GPU nodes with only PCIe interconnection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统云或边缘计算在数字孪生中难以平衡实时性与计算复杂性，需新架构解决。

Method: 提出HP2C-DT参考架构，动态分配任务至边缘、云或HPC资源；实现HP2C-DT框架，使用COMPSs跨基础设施分配工作负载。

Result: 在电网用例中，通信带宽降低一个数量级，响应时间提升2倍，计算密集型工作流强扩展性接近理想。

Conclusion: HPC驱动的HP2C-DT架构显著提升数字孪生性能，适用于复杂现实场景。

Abstract: Digital twins are transforming the way we monitor, analyze, and control
physical systems, but designing architectures that balance real-time
responsiveness with heavy computational demands remains a challenge.
Cloud-based solutions often struggle with latency and resource constraints,
while edge-based approaches lack the processing power for complex simulations
and data-driven optimizations.
  To address this problem, we propose the High-Precision High-Performance
Computer-enabled Digital Twin (HP2C-DT) reference architecture, which
integrates High-Performance Computing (HPC) into the computing continuum.
Unlike traditional setups that use HPC only for offline simulations, HP2C-DT
makes it an active part of digital twin workflows, dynamically assigning tasks
to edge, cloud, or HPC resources based on urgency and computational needs.
  Furthermore, to bridge the gap between theory and practice, we introduce the
HP2C-DT framework, a working implementation that uses COMPSs for seamless
workload distribution across diverse infrastructures. We test it in a power
grid use case, showing how it reduces communication bandwidth by an order of
magnitude through edge-side data aggregation, improves response times by up to
2x via dynamic offloading, and maintains near-ideal strong scaling for
compute-intensive workflows across a practical range of resources. These
results demonstrate how an HPC-driven approach can push digital twins beyond
their current limitations, making them smarter, faster, and more capable of
handling real-world complexity.

Abstract: Quantum computing holds great potential to accelerate the process of solving
complex combinatorial optimization problems. The Distributed Quantum
Approximate Optimization Algorithm (DQAOA) addresses high-dimensional, dense

approach ensures efficient quantum-classical workload management by
distributing large problem instances across classical and quantum resources.
Experimental results demonstrate that enhanced decomposition strategies and
GPU-accelerated quantum simulations significantly improve DQAOA's performance,
achieving up to 10x speedup over CPU-based simulations. This advancement
enables better scalability for large problem instances, supporting the
practical deployment of GPU systems for hybrid quantum-classical applications.
We also highlight ongoing integration efforts using the Quantum Framework (QFw)
to support future HPC-quantum computing systems.

Abstract: The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things
has accelerated the development of distributed, network-sensitive applications,
necessitating ultra-low latency, high throughput, and real-time processing
capabilities. While 5G networks represent a significant technological
milestone, their ability to support AI-driven edge applications remains
constrained by performance gaps observed in real-world deployments. This paper
addresses these limitations and highlights critical advancements needed to
realize a robust and scalable 6G ecosystem optimized for AI applications.
Furthermore, we conduct an empirical evaluation of 5G network infrastructure in
central Europe, with latency measurements ranging from 61 ms to 110 ms across
different close geographical areas. These values exceed the requirements of
latency-critical AI applications by approximately 270%, revealing significant
shortcomings in current deployments. Building on these findings, we propose a
set of recommendations to bridge the gap between existing 5G performance and
the requirements of next-generation AI applications.

Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a privacy-preserving technique for
collaborative model training across heterogeneously distributed silos. Yet, its
reliance on a single central server introduces potential bottlenecks and risks
of single-point failure. Decentralizing the server, often referred to as
decentralized learning, addresses this problem by distributing the server role
across nodes within the network. One drawback regarding this pure
decentralization is it introduces communication inefficiencies, which arise
from increased message exchanges in large-scale setups. However, existing
proposed solutions often fail to simulate the real-world distributed and
decentralized environment in their experiments, leading to unreliable
performance evaluations and limited applicability in practice. Recognizing the
lack from prior works, this work investigates the correlation between model
size and network latency, a critical factor in optimizing decentralized
learning communication. We propose a graph-based gossiping mechanism, where
specifically, minimum spanning tree and graph coloring are used to optimize
network structure and scheduling for efficient communication across various
network topologies and message capacities. Our approach configures and manages
subnetworks on real physical routers and devices and closely models real-world
distributed setups. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves communication, compatible with different topologies and
data sizes, reducing bandwidth and transfer time by up to circa 8 and 4.4
times, respectively, compared to naive flooding broadcasting methods.

Abstract: Energy consumption in current large scale computing infrastructures is
becoming a critical issue, especially with the growing demand for centralized
systems such as cloud environments. With the advancement of microservice
architectures and the Internet of Things, messaging systems have become an
integral and mainstream part of modern computing infrastructures, carrying out
significant workload in a majority of applications. In this paper, we describe
an experimental process to explore energy-based benchmarking for RabbitMQ, one
of the main open source messaging frameworks. The involved system is described,
as well as required components, and setup scenarios, involving different
workloads and configurations among the tests as well as messaging system use
cases. Alternative architectures are investigated and compared from an energy
consumption point of view, for different message rates and consumer numbers.
Differences in architectural selection have been quantified and can lead to up
to 31\% reduction in power consumption. The resulting dataset is made publicly
available and can thus prove helpful for architectures' comparison,
energy-based cost modeling, and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原版红蓝鹅卵石游戏（RBP）假设操作的所有输入需同时存在于快速内存中，而实际计算中输入可逐步聚合。PRBP旨在提供更贴近现实的成本模型。

Method: 通过引入部分计算步骤，比较PRBP与RBP的I/O成本差异，并探讨其理论性质。

Result: 部分计算可显著降低I/O成本，但判断具体DAG中是否存在更优成本是NP难问题。同时，提出了适用于PRBP的S-分区工具。

Conclusion: PRBP为计算任务提供了更精确的I/O成本模型，但其最优成本近似仍为NP难问题。

Abstract: We study an extension of the well-known red-blue pebble game (RBP) with
partial computation steps, inspired by the recent work of Sobczyk. While the
original RBP assumes that we need to have all the inputs of an operation in
fast memory at the same time, in many concrete computations, the inputs can be
aggregated one by one into the final output value. These partial computation
steps can enable pebbling strategies with much smaller I/O cost, and in
settings where such a step-by-step aggregation is possible, this extended
red-blue pebble game offers a much more realistic cost model.
  We establish the fundamental properties of this partial-computing red-blue
pebble game (PRBP), and compare it to the original RBP. We begin with some
simple examples where allowing partial computations can decrease the optimal
I/O cost. It is also shown that the cost can decrease by up to a linear factor
this way, but in general, it is NP-hard to decide whether partial computations
allow for a smaller cost in a specific DAG. We then discuss how $S$-partitions,
a crucial tool for deriving I/O lower bounds in RBP, can be adapted to the PRBP
model. These new tools are then used to establish lower bounds on the I/O cost
of some prominent computational tasks. Finally, we also adapt a hardness result
from RBP, showing that the optimum cost is still NP-hard to approximate in PRBP
to any reasonable factor.

Motivation: 当前量子系统面临量子比特数量有限、相干时间短和易受噪声影响等问题，阻碍了大规模复杂电路的执行。量子算法的发展超过了硬件能力，需要优化调度方法。

Method: 引入了一种模拟工具，支持分布式调度和并行执行量子任务，通过电路分解和噪声感知调度策略（包括强化学习模型）进行比较。

Conclusion: 分布式量子基础设施中，并行化和噪声感知调度能显著提升计算效率，但仍需权衡运行时效率、保真度和通信成本。

Abstract: Present-day quantum systems face critical bottlenecks, including limited
qubit counts, brief coherence intervals, and high susceptibility to errors-all
of which obstruct the execution of large and complex circuits. The advancement
of quantum algorithms has outpaced the capabilities of existing quantum
hardware, making it difficult to scale computations effectively. Additionally,
inconsistencies in hardware performance and pervasive quantum noise undermine
system stability and computational accuracy. To optimize quantum workloads
under these constraints, strategic approaches to task scheduling and resource
coordination are essential. These methods must aim to accelerate processing,
retain operational fidelity, and reduce the communication burden inherent to
distributed setups. One of the persistent challenges in this domain is how to
efficiently divide and execute large circuits across multiple quantum
processors (QPUs), especially in error-prone environments. In response, we
introduce a simulation-based tool that supports distributed scheduling and
concurrent execution of quantum jobs on networked QPUs connected via real-time
classical channels. The tool models circuit decomposition for workloads that
surpass individual QPU limits, allowing for parallel execution through
inter-processor communication. Using this simulation environment, we compare
four distinct scheduling techniques-among them, a model informed by
reinforcement learning. These strategies are evaluated across multiple metrics,
including runtime efficiency, fidelity preservation, and communication costs.
Our analysis underscores the trade-offs inherent in each approach and
highlights how parallelized, noise-aware scheduling can meaningfully improve
computational throughput in distributed quantum infrastructures.

Method: 结合组合数学和数论中的概念，设计了多项式时间近似方案，并研究了多种结构特性。

Result: 展示了多项式时间近似方案的可行性，显著改进了现有常数因子近似，并解决了相关开放性问题。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提升了库存错位问题的理论理解，还为实际应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Since its inception in the mid-60s, the inventory staggering problem has been
explored and exploited in a wide range of application domains, such as
production planning, stock control systems, warehousing, and aerospace/defense
logistics. However, even with a rich history of academic focus, we are still
very much in the dark when it comes to cornerstone computational questions
around inventory staggering and to related structural characterizations, with
our methodological toolbox being severely under-stocked.
  The central contribution of this paper consists in devising a host of
algorithmic techniques and analytical ideas -- some being entirely novel and
some leveraging well-studied concepts in combinatorics and number theory -- for
surpassing essentially all known approximation guarantees for the inventory
staggering problem. In particular, our work demonstrates that numerous
structural properties open the door for designing polynomial-time approximation
schemes, including polynomially-bounded cycle lengths, constantly-many distinct
time intervals, so-called nested instances, and pairwise coprime settings.
These findings offer substantial improvements over currently available
constant-factor approximations and resolve outstanding open questions in their
respective contexts. In parallel, we develop new theory around a number of
yet-uncharted questions, related to the sampling complexity of peak inventory
estimation as well as to the plausibility of groupwise synchronization.
Interestingly, we establish the global nature of inventory staggering, proving
that there are $n$-item instances where, for every subset of roughly $\sqrt{n}$
items, no policy improves on the worst-possible one by a factor greater than
$1+\epsilon$, whereas for the entire instance, there exists a policy that
outperforms the worst-possible one by a factor of nearly $2$, which is optimal.

Motivation: 针对$k$-平面性问题的计算难解性，研究其参数化复杂度，特别是在结构参数化（如树深、顶点覆盖数等）下的表现。

Method: 扩展了Bannister等人的方法，考虑一般情况$k \ge 1$，并针对子类图（如常数树宽图）进行参数化分析。

Result: 证明了即使对于反馈顶点集数不超过3且路径宽度不超过4的近平面图，测试$1$-平面性仍是NP完全的；局部交叉数在反馈顶点集数不超过2的图中难以近似到任何常数因子。

Conclusion: 本文通过参数化方法深化了对$k$-平面性问题的理解，揭示了其计算复杂性在特定图类中的表现。

Abstract: The concept of $k$-planarity is extensively studied in the context of Beyond
Planarity. A graph is $k$-planar if it admits a drawing in the plane in which
each edge is crossed at most $k$ times. The local crossing number of a graph is
the minimum integer $k$ such that it is $k$-planar. The problem of determining
whether an input graph is $1$-planar is known to be NP-complete even for
near-planar graphs [Cabello and Mohar, SIAM J. Comput. 2013], that is, the
graphs obtained from planar graphs by adding a single edge. Moreover, the local
crossing number is hard to approximate within a factor $2 - \varepsilon$ for
any $\varepsilon > 0$ [Urschel and Wellens, IPL 2021]. To address this
computational intractability, Bannister, Cabello, and Eppstein [JGAA 2018]
investigated the parameterized complexity of the case of $k = 1$, particularly
focusing on structural parameterizations on input graphs, such as treedepth,
vertex cover number, and feedback edge number. In this paper, we extend their
approach by considering the general case $k \ge 1$ and give (tight)
parameterized upper and lower bound results. In particular, we strengthen the
aforementioned lower bound results to subclasses of constant-treewidth graphs:
we show that testing $1$-planarity is NP-complete even for near-planar graphs
with feedback vertex set number at most $3$ and pathwidth at most $4$, and the
local crossing number is hard to approximate within any constant factor for
graphs with feedback vertex set number at most $2$.

Method: 针对树和有界树宽图，设计了确定性分布式算法，包括局部舍入框架的应用和改进的近似算法。

Conclusion: 本文为加权最大独立集问题提供了高效的分布式算法，改进了现有结果，并证明了时间复杂度的紧性。

Abstract: The maximum independent set problem is a classic optimization problem that
has also been studied quite intensively in the distributed setting. While the
problem is hard to approximate in general, there are good approximation
algorithms known for several sparse graph families. In this paper, we consider
deterministic distributed CONGEST algorithms for the weighted version of the
problem in trees and graphs of bounded arboricity.
  For trees, we prove that the task of deterministically computing a
$(1-\epsilon)$-approximate solution to the maximum weight independent set
(MWIS) problem has a tight $\Theta(\log^*(n) / \epsilon)$ complexity. The lower
bound already holds on unweighted oriented paths. On the upper bound side, we
show that the bound can be achieved even in unrooted trees.
  For graphs $G=(V,E)$ of arboricity $\beta>1$, we give two algorithms. If the
sum of all node weights is $w(V)$, we show that for any $\epsilon>0$, an
independent set of weight at least $(1-\epsilon)\cdot \frac{w(V)}{4\beta}$ can
be computed in $O(\log^2(\beta/\epsilon)/\epsilon + \log^* n)$ rounds. This
result is obtained by a direct application of the local rounding framework of
Faour, Ghaffari, Grunau, Kuhn, and Rozho\v{n} [SODA '23]. We further show that
for any $\epsilon>0$, an independent set of weight at least
$(1-\epsilon)\cdot\frac{w(V)}{2\beta+1}$ can be computed in
$O(\log^3(\beta)\cdot\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon^2 \cdot\log n)$ rounds. This
improves on a recent result of Gil [OPODIS '23], who showed that a
$1/\lfloor(2+\epsilon)\beta\rfloor$-approximation to the MWIS problem can be
computed in $O(\beta\cdot\log n)$ rounds. As an intermediate step, we design an
algorithm to compute an independent set of total weight at least
$(1-\epsilon)\cdot\sum_{v\in V}\frac{w(v)}{deg(v)+1}$ in time
$O(\log^3(\Delta)\cdot\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon + \log^* n)$, where $\Delta$ is
the maximum degree of the graph.

Result: 在两个数据集上，TrioXpert在异常检测、故障分类和根因定位任务中性能显著提升。

Conclusion: TrioXpert通过多模态数据和协作推理机制，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Automated incident management plays a pivotal role in large-scale
microservice systems. However, many existing methods rely solely on
single-modal data (e.g., metrics, logs, and traces) and struggle to
simultaneously address multiple downstream tasks, including anomaly detection
(AD), failure triage (FT), and root cause localization (RCL). Moreover, the
lack of clear reasoning evidence in current techniques often leads to
insufficient interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose
TrioXpert, an end-to-end incident management framework capable of fully
leveraging multimodal data. TrioXpert designs three independent data processing
pipelines based on the inherent characteristics of different modalities,
comprehensively characterizing the operational status of microservice systems
from both numerical and textual dimensions. It employs a collaborative
reasoning mechanism using large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously handle
multiple tasks while providing clear reasoning evidence to ensure strong
interpretability. We conducted extensive evaluations on two popular
microservice system datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that
TrioXpert achieves outstanding performance in AD (improving by 4.7% to 57.7%),
FT (improving by 2.1% to 40.6%), and RCL (improving by 1.6% to 163.1%) tasks.

Conclusion: 该技术能够适应动态业务环境中的实时变化，生成更稳定的模拟结果，并有效处理概念漂移。

Abstract: Business Process Simulation (BPS) refers to techniques designed to replicate
the dynamic behavior of a business process. Many approaches have been proposed
to automatically discover simulation models from historical event logs,
reducing the cost and time to manually design them. However, in dynamic
business environments, organizations continuously refine their processes to
enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. Existing
techniques to process simulation discovery lack adaptability to real-time
operational changes. In this paper, we propose a streaming process simulation
discovery technique that integrates Incremental Process Discovery with Online
Machine Learning methods. This technique prioritizes recent data while
preserving historical information, ensuring adaptation to evolving process
dynamics. Experiments conducted on four different event logs demonstrate the
importance in simulation of giving more weight to recent data while retaining
historical knowledge. Our technique not only produces more stable simulations
but also exhibits robustness in handling concept drift, as highlighted in one
of the use cases.

Method: 通过对照实验，10名本科生在有无Copilot的情况下完成相似任务，采用混合方法分析性能、行为和访谈。

Conclusion: 教育者需开发新教学方法，利用GenAI助手优势并促进学生反思其建议的原理。

Abstract: When graduates of computing degree programs enter the software industry, they
will most likely join teams working on legacy code bases developed by people
other than themselves. In these so-called brownfield software development
settings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like
GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the
impact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks
remains underexplored. This paper investigates how GitHub Copilot influences
undergraduate students' programming performance, behaviors, and understanding
when completing brownfield programming tasks in which they add new code to an
unfamiliar code base. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10
undergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield
development tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a
mixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and
exit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 35% faster (p < 0.05)
and made 50% more solution progress p (< 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover,
our analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 11% less time
manually writing code (p < 0.05), and 12% less time conducting web searches (p
< 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in
programming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not
understanding how or why Copilot suggestions work. This research suggests the
need for computing educators to develop new pedagogical approaches that
leverage GenAI assistants' benefits while fostering reflection on how and why
GenAI suggestions address brownfield programming tasks. Complete study results

Method: 采用生成-修剪-排序方法，比较ORM与全面验证器的表现。

Result: 使用ORM的系统速度提升11.65倍，准确性仅降低8.33%。

Conclusion: ORM在可扩展且准确的程序排序系统设计中具有重要价值。

Abstract: The standard paradigm for solving coding tasks via large language models
(LLMs) is to generate-then-rank programs, where the latter step uses a verifier
in the ranking process. The growing consensus is that a comprehensive verifier
(e.g., a full test suite) should be prioritized over an outcome reward model
(ORM) whenever possible, with little consideration given to the trade-offs
involved. We aim to challenge this assumption by systematically exploring the
tradeoff between speed and accuracy. We find that ORMs play a crucial role in
scaling verification through trading accuracy for speed, even when a
comprehensive verifier is available. Their value becomes especially apparent
when used in a generate-prune-then-rank approach, where a faster but less
accurate verifier removes incorrect solutions prior to ranking -- leading to a
system that is 11.65x faster while only being 8.33% less accurate than the full
test suite. We analyze the generate-prune-then-rank approach and show that it
works by filtering out incorrect but highly ranked solutions. These findings
enable the design of scalable and accurate program ranking systems.

Result: 实验证明了方法的实用性，并公开了代码供社区使用。

Conclusion: 提出的方法广泛适用，有助于理解LLM对输入变化的敏感性。

Abstract: Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large
Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and
accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs
depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and
quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity
with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's
sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic
evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic
persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM
responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are
completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are
widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our
methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.

Motivation: 现有静态bug分析器在大型代码库中误报率高，主要因路径可行性验证能力不足。

Result: LLM4PFA能过滤72%-96%的误报，性能提升41.1%-105.7%，仅遗漏3个真实bug。

Conclusion: LLM4PFA显著提升了静态bug检测的准确性，减少误报。

Abstract: Static bug analyzers play a crucial role in ensuring software quality.
However, existing analyzers for bug detection in large codebases often suffer
from high false positive rates. This is primarily due to the limited
capabilities of analyzers in path feasibility validation with multiple
conditional branches and complex data dependencies. While current LLM-based
approaches attempt to address this issue, their effectiveness remains limited
due to insufficient constraint cascade analysis and scalability challenges in
large projects. To address this challenge, we propose an iterative path
feasibility analysis framework LLM4PFA. By leveraging LLM agent based targeted
constraint reasoning, and key context-aware analysis driven by agent planning,
LLM4PFA effectively enhances complex inter-procedural path feasibility analysis
for minimizing false positives in static bug detection. Evaluation results show
that LLM4PFA precisely filters out 72% to 96% false positives reported during
static bug detection, significantly outperforming all the baselines by 41.1% -
105.7% improvements; meanwhile LLM4PFA only misses 3 real bugs of 45 true

Method: 结合静态代码分析框架检测问题，利用LLMs进行自动化修复，采用检索增强生成（RAG）提升准确性，并通过代码比较工具解决LLM幻觉问题。

Result: 后续扫描显示代码问题显著减少，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs、静态分析和RAG可有效提升代码质量，优化开发流程。

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and
GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework
detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a
large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted
and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative
prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to
produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance
and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time
external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates
plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code
Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before
applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis
framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code
quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and
resource expenditure.

TL;DR: AutoGEEval++是一个用于评估大语言模型生成地理空间代码的自动化框架，支持多模态数据和复杂任务，并提供了标准化评估协议和基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地理空间代码生成缺乏标准化的自动化评估工具，阻碍了人工智能与地理科学分析的整合。

Method: 基于GEE Python API，AutoGEEval++包含6,365个测试案例的基准数据集，支持多维指标（如准确性、资源使用等），并实现端到端自动化评估。

Result: 评估了24种先进的大语言模型，揭示了不同任务类型和模型设计的性能差异，验证了框架的实用性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: AutoGEEval++为GEE代码生成提供了首个标准化评估协议和基准，为性能比较和领域特定代码评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Geospatial code generation is becoming a key frontier in integrating
artificial intelligence with geo-scientific analysis, yet standardised
automated evaluation tools for this task remain absent. This study presents
AutoGEEval++, an enhanced framework building on AutoGEEval, and the first
automated assessment system for large language models (LLMs) generating
geospatial code on Google Earth Engine (GEE). It supports diverse data
modalities and varying task complexities. Built on the GEE Python API,
AutoGEEval++ features a benchmark dataset-AutoGEEval++-Bench-with 6,365 test
cases across 26 data types and three task categories: unit, combo, and theme
tests. It includes a submission programme and a judge module to realise an
end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline from code generation to
execution-based validation. The framework adopts multi-dimensional
metrics-accuracy, resource usage, run-time efficiency, and error
types-balancing hallucination control and efficiency, and enabling boundary
testing and error pattern analysis. Using AutoGEEval++, we evaluate 24
state-of-the-art LLMs (as of June 2025), including general-purpose,
reasoning-enhanced, code-centric, and geoscience-specific models. Results
reveal clear performance, stability, and error differences across task types,
model designs, and deployment settings, confirming AutoGEEval++'s practical
value and scalability in vertical-domain code generation. This work establishes
the first standardised evaluation protocol and foundational benchmark for
GEE-based LLM code generation, providing a unified basis for performance
comparison and a methodological framework for systematic, domain-specific code
evaluation.

*Fan Wu,Cuiyun Gao,Shuqing Li,Xin-Cheng Wen,Qing Liao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LayoutCoder是一个基于多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的框架，用于从真实网页图像生成UI代码，通过三个关键模块解决UI布局理解和代码生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化UI2Code任务以提高开发效率，但现有深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据且泛化能力差，MLLMs难以理解复杂UI布局。

Method: LayoutCoder包含三个模块：元素关系构建、UI布局解析和布局引导的代码融合，以生成保留布局的准确代码。

Result: 在Snap2Code和Design2Code数据集上，LayoutCoder在BLEU和CLIP分数上分别平均提升10.14%和3.95%。

Conclusion: LayoutCoder在UI2Code任务中表现优异，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Converting user interfaces into code (UI2Code) is a crucial step in website
development, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The automation of
UI2Code is essential to streamline this task, beneficial for improving the
development efficiency. There exist deep learning-based methods for the task;
however, they heavily rely on a large amount of labeled training data and
struggle with generalizing to real-world, unseen web page designs. The advent
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents potential for alleviating
the issue, but they are difficult to comprehend the complex layouts in UIs and
generate the accurate code with layout preserved. To address these issues, we
propose LayoutCoder, a novel MLLM-based framework generating UI code from
real-world webpage images, which includes three key modules: (1) Element
Relation Construction, which aims at capturing UI layout by identifying and
grouping components with similar structures; (2) UI Layout Parsing, which aims
at generating UI layout trees for guiding the subsequent code generation
process; and (3) Layout-Guided Code Fusion, which aims at producing the
accurate code with layout preserved. For evaluation, we build a new benchmark
dataset which involves 350 real-world websites named Snap2Code, divided into
seen and unseen parts for mitigating the data leakage issue, besides the
popular dataset Design2Code. Extensive evaluation shows the superior
performance of LayoutCoder over the state-of-the-art approaches. Compared with
the best-performing baseline, LayoutCoder improves 10.14% in the BLEU score and
3.95% in the CLIP score on average across all datasets.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于规则的自动化框架，用于分类量子软件仓库中的问题，重点关注量子特定的错误类型，并在评估中表现出较高的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的软件错误分类对提升软件质量至关重要，尤其是在量子计算领域，需要专门的方法来处理量子特定的错误。

Method: 采用基于关键词和启发式的技术，对量子软件仓库中的问题进行分类，并通过人工分类验证其可靠性。

Result: 框架在准确性上达到85.21%，F1分数在0.7075到0.8393之间，统计验证显示分类结果具有较高一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架在量子软件错误分类中表现良好，但在严重性分类上仍有改进空间，同时揭示了量子特定错误的分布特征。

Abstract: Accurate classification of software bugs is essential for improving software
quality. This paper presents a rule-based automated framework for classifying
issues in quantum software repositories by bug type, category, severity, and
impacted quality attributes, with additional focus on quantum-specific bug
types. The framework applies keyword and heuristic-based techniques tailored to
quantum computing. To assess its reliability, we manually classified a
stratified sample of 4,984 issues from a dataset of 12,910 issues across 36
Qiskit repositories. Automated classifications were compared with ground truth
using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The framework achieved up to
85.21% accuracy, with F1-scores ranging from 0.7075 (severity) to 0.8393
(quality attribute). Statistical validation via paired t-tests and Cohen's
Kappa showed substantial to almost perfect agreement for bug type (k = 0.696),
category (k = 0.826), quality attribute (k = 0.818), and quantum-specific bug
type (k = 0.712). Severity classification showed slight agreement (k = 0.162),
suggesting room for improvement. Large-scale analysis revealed that classical
bugs dominate (67.2%), with quantum-specific bugs at 27.3%. Frequent bug
categories included compatibility, functional, and quantum-specific defects,
while usability, maintainability, and interoperability were the most impacted
quality attributes. Most issues (93.7%) were low severity; only 4.3% were
critical. A detailed review of 1,550 quantum-specific bugs showed that over
half involved quantum circuit-level problems, followed by gate errors and
hardware-related issues.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文首次对308个已修复的分布式训练/推理框架（DeepSpeed、Megatron-LM和Colossal-AI）的bug进行了大规模实证分析，探讨了bug症状、根本原因、修复策略及自动化潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，分布式训练和推理框架的复杂性增加，导致软件bug频发，影响性能和资源利用。理解这些bug的特性对质量保障至关重要。

Method: 通过分析三个流行框架中的308个已修复bug，研究了bug的症状、根本原因、修复努力及常见低复杂度修复策略。

Result: 研究发现48%的bug修复仅需少量代码更改（<=10 LOC），且存在自动化潜力。分布式特性还引入了独特的bug原因，如分配策略错误和通信错误。

Conclusion: 研究为提升分布式框架可靠性提供了见解，并指出了利用LLM工具实现自动化调试和修复的机会。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed
training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for
scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However,
the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs,
which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result
in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is
fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective
debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale
empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed
training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We
examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and
common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of
these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy
error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs
remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and
root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component
interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal
code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic
optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility
handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we
offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed
training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also
identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging
and repair.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ExpeRepair是一种基于LLM的软件修复方法，通过双通道知识积累从历史修复经验中学习，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM修复方法存在局限性：孤立处理问题且依赖静态提示策略，无法充分利用历史经验。

Method: ExpeRepair通过双记忆系统（情景记忆和语义记忆）动态组合提示，提升修复能力。

Result: 在SWE-bench Lite基准测试中，ExpeRepair的pass@1得分为49.3%，优于现有开源方法。

Conclusion: ExpeRepair通过动态学习和记忆整合，显著提升了软件修复的效果和适应性。

Abstract: Automatically repairing software issues remains a fundamental challenge at
the intersection of software engineering and AI. Although recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for
repository-level repair tasks, current methodologies exhibit two notable
limitations: (1) they often address issues in isolation, neglecting to
incorporate insights from previously resolved issues, and (2) they rely on
static and rigid prompting strategies, which constrain their ability to
generalize across diverse and evolving issue scenarios. Inspired by the dual
memory systems of human cognition, where episodic and semantic memories work
synergistically to support human reasoning and decision-making, we propose
ExpeRepair, a novel LLM-based approach that continuously learns from historical
repair experiences through dual-channel knowledge accumulation. ExpeRepair
organizes historical repair experiences into two complementary memories: an
episodic memory that stores concrete repair demonstrations, and a semantic
memory that encodes abstract reflective insights. At inference time, ExpeRepair
activates both memory systems by retrieving relevant demonstrations from
episodic memory and recalling high-level repair insights from semantic memory.
It further enhances adaptability through dynamic prompt composition,
synergistically integrating both memory types to replace static prompts with
context-aware, experience-driven prompts. Experiments on the SWE-bench Lite
benchmark demonstrate that ExpeRepair achieves a pass@1 score of 49.3% with
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, outperforming all state-of-the-art open-source methods.

TL;DR: BugGen是一个利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动生成、插入和验证RTL中功能性错误的系统，显著提高了验证效率和ML辅助调试的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件复杂性增加了验证资源的压力，需要采用机器学习方法来提高调试效率，但现有方法无法可靠生成多样化和可扩展的错误数据集。

Method: BugGen采用多代理管道，通过LLMs系统性地生成、插入和验证功能性错误，包括模块分区、目标选择和迭代优化机制。

Result: 在OpenTitan IP块上测试，BugGen生成了500个独特错误，功能准确率达94%，并发现了104个未检测到的错误。训练ML模型时分类准确率达88.1%-93.2%。

Conclusion: BugGen为生成高质量错误数据集提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了验证效率和ML辅助调试的实用性。

Abstract: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating
the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency.
However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug
datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to
reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous,
multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically
generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen
partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic
architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to
ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across
five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional
accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five
times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen
identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions,
highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared
against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy,
deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and
complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were
employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high
classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming
the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a
scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly
enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

*Junhang Cheng,Fang Liu,Chengru Wu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AdaptiveLLM框架通过自动评估任务难度动态选择最优LLM，提升代码生成效率与成本平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型选择方法资源密集且忽视成本效率，且依赖人工标注难度标签，不适用于实际场景。

Method: 利用Chain-of-Thought长度估计任务难度，k-means聚类为三个难度级别，CodeBERT嵌入难度特征，XGBoost分类器选择最优模型。

Result: 实验显示AdaptiveLLM在pass@1分数上提升7.86%，资源消耗降低88.9%，比单一模型准确率提升约15%。

Conclusion: AdaptiveLLM通过自动难度评估提供更可靠的选择标准，显著优化性能与成本平衡。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code
generation efficiency, they face inherent challenges in balancing performance
and inference costs across diverse programming tasks. Dynamically selecting the
optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a
promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and
performance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive
and often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on
human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in
real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task
difficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that
dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically
assessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using
Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into
three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed
difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best
model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental
results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score
while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method
ComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an
approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of
cost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides
more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation. Our replication package
is available at https://github.com/cjhCoder7/AdaptiveLLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件/软件系统复杂性增加，尤其是在安全关键领域（如汽车），硬件可用性滞后阻碍了早期软件开发。

Method: 利用容器化封装虚拟平台（基于SystemC TLM-2.0标准），支持云部署和并行测试，并采用开源技术（如QEMU和VCML）避免许可证问题。

Result: 通过AI加速器虚拟平台的案例研究验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为硬件/软件协同开发提供了实用解决方案，加速了开发流程。

Abstract: The ever-increasing complexity of HW/SW systems presents a persistent
challenge, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive, where
extensive testing is imperative. However, the availability of hardware often
lags behind, hindering early-stage software development. To address this,
Virtual Platforms (VPs) based on the SystemC TLM-2.0 standard have emerged as a
pivotal solution, enabling pre-silicon execution and testing of unmodified
target software. In this study, we propose an approach leveraging
containerization to encapsulate VPs in order to reduce environment dependencies
and enable cloud deployment for fast, parallelized test execution, as well as
open-source VP technologies such as QEMU and VCML to obviate the need for seat
licenses. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we present an Artificial
Intelligence (AI) accelerator VP case study. Through our research, we offer a
robust solution to address the challenges posed by the complexity of HW/SW
systems, with practical implications for accelerating HW/SW co-development.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现，44.6%的GitHub拉取请求中，开发者评论文件的顺序并非按字母顺序，而是遵循其他有意义的顺序，如最大差异优先、与标题描述相似度优先或测试优先。非字母顺序的审查覆盖率更高，但获得批准的几率略低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨开发者在代码审查中如何选择文件导航顺序，以优化审查效率和效果。

Method: 分析23,241个GitHub拉取请求中的代码审查评论，研究评论顺序的模式。

Result: 44.6%的拉取请求评论顺序非字母顺序，其中20.6%最大差异优先，17.6%与标题描述相似度优先，29%测试优先。非字母顺序的审查覆盖率更高，但批准率略低。

Conclusion: 代码审查工具需支持更灵活的导航策略，尤其是大型拉取请求中，开发者倾向于采用复杂策略。

Abstract: Developers use tools such as GitHub pull requests to review code, discuss
proposed changes, and request modifications. While changed files are commonly
presented in alphabetical order, this does not necessarily coincide with the
reviewer's preferred navigation sequence. This study investigates the different
navigation orders developers follow while commenting on changes submitted in
pull requests. We mined code review comments from 23,241 pull requests in 100
popular Java and Python repositories on GitHub to analyze the order in which
the reviewers commented on the submitted changes. Our analysis shows that for
44.6% of pull requests, the reviewers comment in a non-alphabetical order.
Among these pull requests, we identified traces of alternative meaningful
orders: 20.6% (2,134) followed a largest-diff-first order, 17.6% (1,827) were
commented in the order of the files' similarity to the pull request's title and
description, and 29% (1,188) of pull requests containing changes to both
production and test files adhered to a test-first order. We also observed that
the proportion of reviewed files to total submitted files was significantly
higher in non-alphabetically ordered reviews, which also received slightly
fewer approvals from reviewers, on average. Our findings highlight the need for
additional support during code reviews, particularly for larger pull requests,
where reviewers are more likely to adopt complex strategies rather than
following a single predefined order.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在生产环境中因上下文偏差而非统计异常失败，但现有监控研究缺乏对上下文信息的系统化理解。

Method: 通过系统综述94项研究，提出C-SAR框架，分类上下文信息，并识别20种可复用模式。

Result: C-SAR框架为机器学习监控提供了系统化的上下文信息管理方法，支持监控活动的分类与优化。

Conclusion: 研究将机器学习监控从统计观测提升为系统化管理，为可靠监控实践提供了新视角。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models in production do not fail due to statistical
anomalies in their input data; they fail due to contextual misalignment -- when
their environment deviates from training assumptions, leading to unreliable
predictions. Effective ML monitoring requires rich contextual information to
move beyond detecting statistical shifts toward meaningful alerts and
systematic root-cause analysis. Yet, surprisingly, despite extensive research
in ML monitoring and related disciplines (drift detection, data validation,
out-of-distribution detection), there is no shared understanding of how to use
contextual information -- striking, given that monitoring involves
interpretation of information in context. In response, this paper presents a
systematic review to characterize and structure the various types of contextual
information in this domain. Our analysis examines 94 primary studies across
data mining, databases, software engineering, and ML. We introduce the
Contextual System--Aspect--Representation (C-SAR) framework, a conceptual model
that synthesizes our findings. We also identify 20 recurring and potentially
reusable patterns of specific system, aspect, and representation combinations,
and map them to the monitoring activities they support. This study provides a
new perspective on ML monitoring: from interpreting "tea leaves" of
observational statistics into constructing and managing "system maps" that
enable systematic and reliable ML monitoring practices.

Conclusion: 该方法能更准确地反映用户对AI应用的体验，揭示了普遍满意度和领域特定问题。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated
across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education,
entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and
critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the
overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,
leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with
894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a
multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and
systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.
Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and
clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables
scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million
aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.
Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:
positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized
assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,
scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language
support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and
frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,
co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat
positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.
To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world
user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers
both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

TL;DR: HyperRes是一个基于超图的版本依赖解析系统，支持跨语言生态系统的依赖管理，无需用户更换包管理器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言项目无法跨生态系统表达精确依赖，且外部系统和硬件依赖通常未版本化。

Method: 定义HyperRes系统，将现有包管理器翻译为超图模型，实现跨生态系统依赖解析。

Result: 证明依赖解析可在当前独立的生态系统中工作，支持精确部署环境定制。

Conclusion: HyperRes为跨生态系统依赖管理提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Package managers are everywhere, with seemingly every language and operating
system implementing their own solution. The lack of interoperability between
these systems means that multi-lingual projects are unable to express precise
dependencies across language ecosystems, and external system and hardware
dependencies are typically implicit and unversioned. We define HyperRes, a
formal system for describing versioned dependency resolution using a hypergraph
that is expressive enough to model many ecosystems and solve dependency
constraints across them. We define translations from dozens of existing package
managers to HyperRes and comprehensively demonstrate that dependency resolution
can work across ecosystems that are currently distinct. This does not require
users to shift their choice of package managers; instead, HyperRes allows for
the translation of packaging metadata between ecosystems, and for solving to be
precisely specialised to a particular deployment environment.

*Fabian C. Peña,Steffen Herbold*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个全面评估大语言模型（LLMs）在非代码软件工程任务上的基准SELU，覆盖17种任务，并测试了多种模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在非代码软件工程任务中的表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 构建SELU基准，涵盖分类、回归、NER和MLM任务，测试22个开源LLMs和2个专有模型，使用多种指标评估性能。

Result: 中等规模的解码器模型表现最佳，领域适应性预训练效果有限。

Conclusion: SELU为模型选择提供指导，并建议扩展至生成和设计导向任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code understanding and generation; however, their effectiveness on non-code
Software Engineering (SE) tasks remains underexplored. We present the first
comprehensive benchmark, which we name `Software Engineering Language
Understanding' (SELU), for evaluating LLMs on 17 non-code tasks, spanning from
identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating
the effort and complexity of backlog items. SELU covers classification,
regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
targets, with data drawn from diverse sources such as code repositories, issue
tracking systems, and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs,
prompt two proprietary alternatives, and train two baselines. Performance is
measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and
compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that
moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently form a top-tier, exhibiting
high mean performance and low across-task variance, while domain adaptation via
code-focused pre-training might yield only modest improvements. These insights
guide model selection for non-code SE workflows and highlight directions for
expanding SELU to generative and design-oriented scenarios.

*Quinn Thibeault,Giulia Pedrielli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MultiCoSim是一个基于Python的仿真框架，旨在解决复杂CPS仿真中的灵活性和自动化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CPS复杂性和规模的增加，现有仿真工具在配置、自动化和模块化方面存在不足，限制了仿真实验的高效使用。

Method: MultiCoSim通过支持分布式、基于组件的协同仿真，允许用户以编程方式定义和配置仿真组件。

Result: 案例研究表明，MultiCoSim能够灵活地支持自定义控制器和现成平台的集成，简化了CPS仿真流程。

Conclusion: MultiCoSim为CPS研究和开发提供了一种高效、灵活的仿真解决方案。

Abstract: Simulation is a foundational tool for the analysis and testing of
cyber-physical systems (CPS), underpinning activities such as algorithm
development, runtime monitoring, and system verification. As CPS grow in
complexity and scale, particularly in safety-critical and learning-enabled
settings, accurate analysis and synthesis increasingly rely on the rapid use of
simulation experiments. Because CPS inherently integrate hardware, software,
and physical processes, simulation platforms must support co-simulation of
heterogeneous components at varying levels of fidelity. Despite recent advances
in high-fidelity modeling of hardware, firmware, and physics, co-simulation in
diverse environments remains challenging. These limitations hinder the
development of reusable benchmarks and impede the use of simulation for
automated and comparative evaluation.
  Existing simulation tools often rely on rigid configurations, lack automation
support, and present obstacles to portability and modularity. Many are
configured through static text files or impose constraints on how simulation
components are represented and connected, making it difficult to flexibly
compose systems or integrate components across platforms.
  To address these challenges, we introduce MultiCoSim, a Python-based
simulation framework that enables users to define, compose, and configure
simulation components programmatically. MultiCoSim supports distributed,
component-based co-simulation and allows seamless substitution and
reconfiguration of components. We demonstrate the flexibility of MultiCoSim
through case studies that include co-simulations involving custom
automaton-based controllers, as well as integration with off-the-shelf
platforms like the PX4 autopilot for aerial robotics. These examples highlight
MultiCoSim's capability to streamline CPS simulation pipelines for research and
development.

*Lianghong Guo,Yanlin Wang,Caihua Li,Pengyu Yang,Jiachi Chen,Wei Tao,Yingtian Zou,Duyu Tang,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-Factory是一个自动化流水线，用于高效构建和验证GitHub问题解决任务的大规模数据集，解决了传统方法的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建大规模数据集对训练和评估LLMs的软件工程能力至关重要，但传统方法耗时且费力。

Method: SWE-Factory整合了三个核心自动化组件：SWE-Builder（多智能体系统）、基于退出码的标准化评分方法和自动化的fail2pass验证。

Result: 实验表明，SWE-Factory能高效构建有效任务实例（如GPT-4.1-mini下每实例$0.045），评分准确率达100%，验证精度为0.92。

Conclusion: SWE-Factory有望加速高质量数据集的收集，推动LLMs在软件工程中的应用。

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is
crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating
such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in
the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and
validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated
pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our
pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce
SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment
construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a
collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to
enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based
grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.
Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit
code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show
that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,
with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per
instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at
the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our
exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,
and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall
of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of
large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training
and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at
https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.

*Abiodun Ganiyu,Pranshav Gajjar,Vijay K Shah*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: AI5GTest是一个基于AI的自动化测试框架，用于验证O-RAN组件的合规性，显著减少测试时间并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RAN的分散架构带来了复杂的测试挑战，现有框架依赖人工且易出错，需要更高效、准确的解决方案。

Method: AI5GTest利用Gen-LLM、Val-LLM和Debug-LLM的协作框架，自动生成测试流程、验证合规性并进行根因分析。

Result: 相比传统方法，AI5GTest显著减少了测试时间，同时保持了高验证准确性。

Conclusion: AI5GTest为O-RAN组件的自动化测试提供了高效、可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the
telecommunications industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity,
and rapid innovation. However, its disaggregated architecture introduces
complex testing challenges, particularly in validating multi-vendor components
against O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications. Existing frameworks, such as
those provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres (OTICs), rely heavily on
manual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error, leading to
inconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we present
AI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to
automate the validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative
Large Language Models (LLM) framework consisting of Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and
Debug-LLM. Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test
cases based on 3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references
signaling messages against these flows to validate compliance and detect
deviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis,
providing insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency and
trustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the
Gen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for
approval before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test
cases obtained from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest
demonstrates a significant reduction in overall test execution time compared to
traditional manual methods, while maintaining high validation accuracy.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of wireless networks has resulted in numerous
challenges stemming from their extensive demands for quality of service towards
innovative quality of experience metrics (e.g., user-defined metrics in terms
of sense of physical experience for haptics applications). In the meantime,
large language models (LLMs) emerged as promising solutions for many difficult
and complex applications/tasks. These lead to a notion of the integration of
LLMs and wireless networks. However, this integration is challenging and needs
careful attention in design. Therefore, in this article, we present a notion of
rational wireless networks powered by \emph{telecom LLMs}, namely,
\emph{LLM-native wireless systems}. We provide fundamentals, vision, and a case
study of the distributed implementation of LLM-native wireless systems. In the
case study, we propose a solution based on double deep Q-learning (DDQN) that
outperforms existing DDQN solutions. Finally, we provide open challenges.

Motivation: 解决物联网智能系统和通信网络中资源有限微控制器上的流量分类问题，平衡准确性、计算效率和实际部署需求。

Method: 采用硬件感知的神经架构搜索（HW-NAS）优化轻量级1D-CNN模型，并进行INT8量化以减少计算资源需求。

Result: 在ISCX VPN-NonVPN数据集上达到96.59%准确率，参数仅88.26K，最大张量大小20.12K，FLOPs为10.08M；在两种微控制器上分别实现31.43ms和115.40ms的推理延迟，能耗为7.86 mJ和29.10 mJ。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在设备端进行加密流量分析的可行性，为可扩展、低功耗的物联网安全解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical deep learning (DL) approach for
energy-efficient traffic classification (TC) on resource-limited
microcontrollers, which are widely used in IoT-based smart systems and
communication networks. Our objective is to balance accuracy, computational
efficiency, and real-world deployability. To that end, we develop a lightweight
1D-CNN, optimized via hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), which
achieves 96.59% accuracy on the ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset with only 88.26K
parameters, a 20.12K maximum tensor size, and 10.08M floating-point operations
(FLOPs). Moreover, it generalizes across various TC tasks, with accuracies
ranging from 94% to 99%. To enable deployment, the model is quantized to INT8,
suffering only a marginal 1-2% accuracy drop relative to its Float32
counterpart. We evaluate real-world inference performance on two
microcontrollers: the high-performance STM32F746G-DISCO and the cost-sensitive
Nucleo-F401RE. The deployed model achieves inference latencies of 31.43ms and
115.40ms, with energy consumption of 7.86 mJ and 29.10 mJ per inference,
respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of on-device encrypted
traffic analysis, paving the way for scalable, low-power IoT security
solutions.

Conclusion: 该集成策略为未来6G网络的需求提供了一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing demand for reliable, high-capacity communication during
large-scale outdoor events poses significant challenges for traditional
Terrestrial Networks (TNs), which often struggle to provide consistent coverage
in high-density environments. This paper presents a novel 6G radio network
planning framework that integrates Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) with
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) to deliver ubiquitous coverage and
enhanced network capacity. Our framework overcomes the limitations of
conventional deployable base stations by leveraging NTN architectures,
including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and passive RIS platforms seamlessly
integrated with Beyond 5G (B5G) TNs. By incorporating advanced B5G technologies
such as Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) and beamforming, and by
optimizing spectrum utilization across the C, S, and Ka bands, we implement a
rigorous interference management strategy based on a dynamic SINR model.
Comprehensive calculations and simulations validate the proposed framework,
demonstrating significant improvements in connectivity, reliability, and
cost-efficiency in crowded scenarios. This integration strategy represents a
promising solution for meeting the evolving demands of future 6G networks.

Motivation: 月球表面无线通信系统需要满足自主性、抗干扰性和环境适应性等严格需求，现有Space-O-RAN模型的决策逻辑静态且缺乏语义集成。

Method: 通过引入语义代理层，结合MCP和A2A协议，实现跨实时、近实时和非实时控制层的上下文感知决策。

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless
communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the
ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its
decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We
propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,
landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination
strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic
compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over
telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

Motivation: 传统MCIL方法仅关注视觉和文本，本文探索了视觉、音频和文本的多模态增量学习，旨在整合互补信息并缓解灾难性遗忘。

Method: 1. 基于MoE结构的MIFE实现增量微调；2. AAVFM增强特征判别性和泛化性；3. 多模态对比训练损失优化跨模态对齐；4. 引入两种MCIL评估指标。

Result: 在三个多模态数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多模态增量学习中表现出色，解决了信息整合和遗忘问题。

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NOCL的新框架，通过节点描述和节点概念技术，将LLM应用于非文本属性图，并显著减少令牌长度，同时在零样本场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络依赖监督学习，限制了其在标签稀缺场景的泛化能力；而LLM在应用于图时面临推理能力、令牌长度和任务单一等挑战。

Method: NOCL采用节点描述和节点概念技术，将节点属性转化为结构化自然语言并编码为语义嵌入，同时使用图表示描述符统一多级任务。

Result: 实验表明NOCL在监督学习中与传统MPNN和混合方法竞争，并在零样本场景中表现优越。

Conclusion: NOCL为图基础模型开辟了新方向，解决了LLM在图任务中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 传统逆设计方法耗时且计算量大，需改进以高效预测薄膜厚度及其光学特性。

Method: 采用串联神经网络（TNN），结合MLP、CNN和LSTM算法，比较九种配置的性能。

Result: LSTM-LSTM组合精度最高但训练时间最长，CNN-LSTM组合在精度和速度上表现最优。

Conclusion: CNN-LSTM TNN是薄膜逆设计的高效解决方案，平衡了精度和计算效率。

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法忽略偏好对的固有质量和学习效用差异，导致数据利用和性能不佳。

Method: 提出Omni-DPO，联合考虑偏好对的固有质量和模型学习动态，自适应加权样本。

Result: 在文本理解和数学推理任务中，Omni-DPO显著优于基线方法，如Gemma-2-9b-it在Arena-Hard上领先Claude 3 Opus 6.7分。

Conclusion: Omni-DPO通过优化数据利用和学习动态，表现出卓越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

Motivation: LLMs在不确定性量化方面存在挑战，尤其是在高风险领域应用受限，且其封闭性和对提示的敏感性增加了问题的复杂性。

Method: 将提示视为文本参数，利用小训练数据集进行贝叶斯推断，并引入MHLP算法（结合提示优化与MCMC方法）。

Conclusion: 研究为将贝叶斯方法融入LLMs提供了一条可行路径，有望构建更可靠和校准的LLM系统。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信息理论的框架，优化分层变分自编码器（HVAE）的潜在维度分配，以提高分布外（OOD）检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，OOD检测至关重要，但现有HVAE方法在潜在维度分配上表现不佳，导致无效表示或后验崩溃。

Method: 通过信息理论原则，形式化信息损失与表示衰减的权衡，提出最优潜在维度分配比例$r^{\ast}$。

Result: 实验证明，调整该比例能显著提升OOD检测性能，优于基线HVAE配置。

Conclusion: 该框架为潜在结构设计提供了理论指导，增强了深度生成模型的OOD检测鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in
practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

TL;DR: 该研究通过两阶段深度自编码器架构实现了MNIST手写数字的高级无监督聚类系统，结合重建误差和KMeans聚类损失，优化了聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过无监督学习实现MNIST手写数字的高效聚类，同时平衡数据重建精度和聚类分离纯度。

Method: 采用两阶段深度自编码器架构，第一阶段训练自编码器以最小化重建误差，第二阶段结合KMeans聚类损失优化潜在嵌入。

Result: 模型在Silhouette Score、Davies-Bouldin Index、NMI和ARI等指标上表现出色，并通过t-SNE可视化展示了清晰的数字聚类。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模图像聚类应用提供了可靠的无监督表示学习基础，兼具可解释性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST
handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep
neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop
minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction
errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans
clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based
objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization
combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable
results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during
extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score
and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when
processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present
learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches
an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster
separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and
scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps
deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image
clustering applications.

<details>

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中个性化学习和通信效率的问题，同时避免负协作。

Result: 在两个异构数据集上显著优于现有基线方法，同时提升了计算和通信效率以及公平性。

Conclusion: 该方法在联邦学习中实现了高效、个性化的协作学习，具有显著优势。

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然对象复杂且多变，传统模拟方法计算成本高，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 基于分数扩散的生成模型，通过退火Langevin动力学在生成和推断中强制非负性。

Result: 生成的3D云体积数据符合物理趋势，专家难以区分其非物理性。

Conclusion: NnD是一种高效且物理一致的非负对象生成方法。

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

Motivation: 现有图主动学习方法主要关注静态数据集和预测准确性，忽略了用户负担和动态环境适应性。

Method: 引入GRAIL框架，提出新指标评估多样性、用户负担和持续有效性。

Result: 实验显示现有方法在动态环境中存在性能与用户负担的权衡问题。

Conclusion: GRAIL为动态环境中的图主动学习提供了更全面的评估机制。

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an
evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 研究在无感知设置下的多玩家多臂老虎机问题，其中玩家仅能获取自身奖励且无法感知碰撞，臂的容量未知，增加了协调和容量发现的挑战。

Method: 提出A-CAPELLA算法，通过协作假设检验协议实现同步连续消除和容量估计，利用精心设计的碰撞模式。

Result: 算法在广义无感知设置下实现了对数级遗憾，证明了其高效性。

Conclusion: A-CAPELLA为去中心化无感知多玩家多臂老虎机问题提供了一种高效的解决方案，尤其在臂容量未知的情况下。

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably
efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm
capacities.

Motivation: 强化学习代理从仿真到现实部署时存在性能差距，标准域随机化（DR）未利用离线数据。

Method: 将ODR形式化为参数化模拟器家族的最大似然估计，证明其一致性，推导误差界限，并提出E-DROPO算法。

Result: ODR的仿真到现实误差比均匀DR更紧，E-DROPO提升了零样本迁移的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ODR理论框架为仿真到现实迁移提供了更优方法，E-DROPO进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BYOL-γ增强GCBC的方法，通过引入时间一致性的状态表示，提升目标条件行为克隆（GCBC）在组合泛化任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标条件行为克隆（GCBC）在训练任务中表现良好，但在处理新颖状态-目标对时泛化能力不足，部分原因是缺乏时间一致性的状态表示。

Method: 提出BYOL-γ增强GCBC，通过一种简单的表示学习目标，无需对比样本或TD学习，近似后继表示，提升组合泛化能力。

Result: 在多个挑战性任务中，该方法表现出色，验证了其组合泛化能力的有效性。

Conclusion: BYOL-γ增强GCBC通过改进状态表示的时间一致性，显著提升了GCBC在组合泛化任务中的性能。

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Motivation: 研究动机是理解模型自由强化学习训练的RNN如何利用测试时计算来解决更多游戏关卡，并揭示其内部机制。

Method: 方法是通过逆向工程分析RNN的激活模式，发现其通过方向相关通道表示计划，类似于价值函数，并利用专用核扩展这些激活以形成路径。

Result: 结果表明，RNN的机制类似于双向搜索，但其状态表示和计划分层处理与经典搜索不同。

Conclusion: 结论是，尽管RNN的机制与经典搜索不同，但其通过模型自由训练学习到的机制可以用熟悉的术语理解。

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

Motivation: 传统生存分析方法（如Beran估计器）在处理复杂数据结构和重度删失时表现不佳，需要非参数且高效的新方法。

Method: 提出三种模型：iSurvM（基于均值似然函数）、iSurvQ（基于分位数似然函数）、iSurvJ（基于联合学习），利用区间值概率分布和注意力机制处理删失数据。

Result: 实验证明，新模型（尤其是iSurvJ）在准确性和计算复杂度上均优于Beran估计器。

Conclusion: 新模型为非参数生存分析提供了高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

Motivation: 早期检测心力衰竭（HF）对改善预后至关重要，但现有心率监测工具依赖群体平均值，缺乏个体化精准性。

Method: 结合生理模型约束的神经网络框架（PMB-NN），利用氧摄取（VO2）数据训练和测试，嵌入简化人体运动生理模型。

Conclusion: PMB-NN框架为个性化实时心脏监测提供了新可能，尤其在日常活动中心率精准估计方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

Result: 在13个数据集和13种评分函数上的实验表明，该方法优于现有技术和对比学习方法。

Conclusion: 双曲嵌入在分布外识别中表现优异，支持层次化泛化。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比学习方法（如SimCLR和SupCon）缺乏不确定性量化机制，限制了其应用。

Method: VCL通过最大化证据下界（ELBO），将InfoNCE损失作为重建项，并添加KL散度正则化，建模后验分布为投影正态分布。

Result: VCL在多个基准测试中缓解了维度崩溃，提高了与类标签的互信息，分类准确率与基线相当或更好，同时提供了有意义的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: VCL为对比学习提供了概率基础，成为对比方法的新基准。

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

Abstract: The advance of speech decoding from non-invasive brain data holds the
potential for profound societal impact. Among its most promising applications
is the restoration of communication to paralysed individuals affected by speech
deficits such as dysarthria, without the need for high-risk surgical
interventions. The ultimate aim of the 2025 PNPL competition is to produce the
conditions for an "ImageNet moment" or breakthrough in non-invasive neural
decoding, by harnessing the collective power of the machine learning community.
  To facilitate this vision we present the largest within-subject MEG dataset
recorded to date (LibriBrain) together with a user-friendly Python library
(pnpl) for easy data access and integration with deep learning frameworks. For
the competition we define two foundational tasks (i.e. Speech Detection and
Phoneme Classification from brain data), complete with standardised data splits
and evaluation metrics, illustrative benchmark models, online tutorial code, a
community discussion board, and public leaderboard for submissions. To promote
accessibility and participation the competition features a Standard track that
emphasises algorithmic innovation, as well as an Extended track that is
expected to reward larger-scale computing, accelerating progress toward a
non-invasive brain-computer interface for speech.

Conclusion: WBSAC通过定向探索策略有效提升了稀疏奖励环境中的学习效率。

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DynaSubVAE是一种动态子群变分自编码器框架，通过联合表示学习和自适应OOD检测，动态更新潜在结构以捕捉新趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实观测数据常包含偏离全局模式的异质子群，现有模型常忽略这些群体，导致预测不准确甚至有害。

Method: DynaSubVAE结合非参数聚类机制（类似高斯混合模型），基于嵌入相似性发现和建模潜在子群。

Result: 实验表明DynaSubVAE在近OOD和远OOD检测中表现优异，尤其在类OOD场景中优于传统聚类方法。

Conclusion: DynaSubVAE的动态子群机制在OOD检测和精度上优于独立聚类方法。

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), we propose a unified method for

Method: 使用EPHNOGRAM数据集，结合线性和非线性机器学习模型（如非因果LSTM），分析ECG和PCG的相互重建及跨个体和生理状态的影响。

Result: 非线性模型（尤其是非因果LSTM）在重建ECG和PCG时表现更优，PCG重建ECG更易实现；基于包络的建模显著提升跨个体泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ECG和PCG的波形特征和事件时序关系，为新型多模态心脏监测技术提供了潜在应用。

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代应用对模拟拓扑设计的定制化需求高，但现有方法效率低且对数值输入敏感度不足。

Method: 采用SFCI（简洁浮点输入规范表示法），通过标识符优化组件类型识别，降低复杂度并提升数值精度。

Result: 实验显示LaMAGIC2在0.01的严格容差下成功率提高34%，MSE降低10倍，且对复杂电路适应性更强。

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2为模拟拓扑生成提供了更高效的框架，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

Conclusion: DC-Clustering填补了联邦学习在复杂数据分区场景下的空白，具有隐私保护、通信高效和灵活性等优势，适用于医疗和金融等领域。

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

Result: 在合成噪声和真实众包数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过元学习和潜在空间建模，解决了小数据下的噪声标注问题。

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

Result: 新方法解决了88%现有方法无法处理的问题，占总问题的41%。

Conclusion: 揭示了传统约束的不合理性，提供了改进SDP验证实用性的方案，推动更可靠的DNN系统发展。

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

Conclusion: Graph-MLLM为多模态图学习提供了公平评估工具，并展示了微调MLLMs的潜力，有望推动该领域进一步发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

Conclusion: 协作学习在特定条件下优于独立学习，Col-UCB算法有效平衡了组间探索负担。

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

Conclusion: PyLO为学习优化器的实际应用提供了便捷工具，展示了其在真实任务中的优势。

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

Motivation: 发展中国家的空气污染问题严重，但现有的AQI监测数据因传感器稀疏而无法准确反映局部实际情况。

Method: 使用时空图神经网络（GNN）对AirDelhi数据集进行AQI预测，覆盖1平方公里范围。

Result: 方法在MSE指标上比现有工作提升71.654，减少了79%的误差，即使在未见过的坐标上也表现良好。同时发现了AQI的短期重复模式和空间关系变化。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了AQI预测的准确性，并提供了新的AQI动态特征，代码已开源。

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The
code is available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）代理的出现，从观察和语言反馈中交互式学习成为一个重要研究方向，但目前缺乏对这些决策问题的理论框架。

Method: 通过形式化LLF问题，提出转移规避维度作为复杂性度量，并开发HELiX算法，通过顺序交互解决LLF问题。

Result: 研究表明，转移规避维度能有效反映反馈信息对学习复杂性的影响，且HELiX算法在多个实证领域表现优异。

Conclusion: 本文为从通用语言反馈中设计交互式学习算法迈出了第一步，展示了HELiX的潜力。

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于小波的新方法，用于分析生理信号，解决了信号中的噪声和非平稳性问题，并首次引入了针对EMG和ECG的大规模预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生理信号常受运动伪影、基线漂移和低信噪比干扰，且具有非平稳性，传统方法难以处理。

Method: 采用小波分析方法捕捉多尺度时频特征，并构建了针对EMG和ECG的预训练模型，同时整合EEG模型形成多模态框架。

Result: 方法在任务中表现优异，解决了低信噪比、高个体差异和设备不匹配等问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为生理信号分析奠定了基础，多模态设计对可穿戴健康监测和临床诊断具有潜在影响。

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

Motivation: 研究动机是通过可观测数据推断材料响应的不可逆演化，克服传统RNN模型的自一致性和初始状态敏感性问题。

Method: 方法包括开发了HANO，一种基于傅里叶神经算子的自回归模型，嵌入分层自注意力机制以捕捉多尺度特征。

Result: 结果表明，HANO在预测精度、泛化能力和鲁棒性上优于基线模型，适用于复杂条件下的材料模拟。

Conclusion: 结论是HANO为模拟非弹性材料提供了有效的数据驱动替代方案，适合与经典数值求解器集成。

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

Motivation: 在流式数据环境中，持续学习需要高效更新模型以适应新任务，同时避免灾难性遗忘。大型预训练模型的计算需求使得效率成为关键挑战。

Result: 在视觉Transformer和大型语言模型上的实验表明，该方法在视觉和自然语言处理任务中均表现出高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: TreeLoRA为大型预训练模型的持续学习提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗、金融等领域的应用增多，微调数据集中的敏感属性（如患者人口统计或疾病流行率）可能被泄露，但此前对此类攻击在LLMs中的适用性尚不明确。

Method: 提出了PropInfer基准任务，基于ChatDoctor数据集，设计了问答和聊天完成两种微调范式，并开发了基于提示生成的攻击和利用词频信号的影子模型攻击。

Result: 实验表明，这两种攻击方法在多种预训练LLMs上均能成功，揭示了LLMs此前未被识别的漏洞。

Conclusion: LLMs在微调后存在泄露敏感数据集属性的风险，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Conclusion: 研究强调了控制基础模型变异的重要性，为准确揭示模型能力间的因果关系提供了科学依据。

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs), vital for large model alignment, are underexplored for
complex embodied tasks like Embodied Question Answering (EQA) where nuanced
evaluation of agents' spatial, temporal, and logical understanding is critical
yet not considered by generic approaches. We introduce EQA-RM, a novel

Conclusion: PAJAMA为LLM生成内容的评估提供了一种高效、低成本且可靠的替代方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM
generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API
costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To
address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model
Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging
programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can
be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing
interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted.
Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83%
and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a
Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a
model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of
RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the
JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

Motivation: 野火蔓延预测模型在多日模拟中与观测结果存在偏差，需数据同化改进。

Method: 使用条件生成对抗网络，结合VIIRS、GOES数据和地形信息，训练于WRF-SFIRE模拟数据。

Result: 在五次太平洋美国野火验证中，平均Sorensen-Dice系数为0.81，地形影响较小。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效预测野火蔓延，卫星数据是关键，地形影响有限。

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

Result: 新方法在SOC数据集上表现出更均匀的协变量特征空间和空间异质性覆盖。

Conclusion: 谱聚类-cLHS方法能提供更平衡的训练数据，提升SOC预测的准确性。

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

scalability, accuracy, and interpretability compared to traditional neural

forecasting electricity Day-Ahead Market (DAM) prices using short historical
training windows, with a focus on detecting seasonal trends and price spikes.
We evaluate four models, namely LSTM with Feed Forward Error Correction (FFEC),
XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, across three European energy markets (Greece,
Belgium, Ireland) using feature sets derived from ENTSO-E forecast data.
Training window lengths range from 7 to 90 days, allowing assessment of model
adaptability under constrained data availability. Results indicate that
LightGBM consistently achieves the highest forecasting accuracy and robustness,
particularly with 45 and 60 day training windows, which balance temporal
relevance and learning depth. Furthermore, LightGBM demonstrates superior
detection of seasonal effects and peak price events compared to LSTM and other
boosting models. These findings suggest that short-window training approaches,
combined with boosting methods, can effectively support DAM forecasting in
volatile, data-scarce environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏熟练工程师且手动优化耗时，PCB设计中的最佳实践常被忽视，导致后期开发成本增加和产品生命周期缩短。

Result: 在三个PCB设计优化任务中，GNN表现出高准确性，证明了该方法的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效、低成本地自动化PCB设计优化。

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled
by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy
and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design
optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

Conclusion: 该方法为公平性评估提供了统计严谨的决策框架，适应不同规模的子群，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

*Yu-Jie Zhang,Peng Zhao,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于mixability的在线学习方法，显著改善了动态遗憾，特别是在非平稳环境中处理具有强曲率的损失函数（如平方或逻辑损失）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态遗憾最小化方法主要针对凸函数，对于具有更强曲率的损失函数研究不足。论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用指数权重方法结合固定共享更新，利用mixability性质捕捉损失曲率，简化了分析框架。

Result: 实现了动态遗憾的显著改进，从现有的$\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$提升到$\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$。

Conclusion: 通过mixability性质，论文提供了一个简单而强大的分析框架，避免了复杂的KKT分析，显著提升了动态遗憾的性能。

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

*Reza Karbasi,Masoud Rahimi,Abdol-Hossein Vahabie,Hadi Moradi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段方法，用于准确数字化纸基心电图（ECG）记录，特别针对信号重叠问题。实验结果表明，该方法在分割和数字化任务上均优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纸基ECG记录数字化中信号重叠这一常见但未充分解决的问题，以提高数字化精度。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）基于U-Net的分割网络，用于隔离ECG主迹线；2）自适应网格检测模块增强的数字化技术，将分割结果转换为时间序列信号。

Result: U-Net分割IoU为0.87；数字化任务中，非重叠信号MSE为0.0010（基线0.0015），重叠信号MSE为0.0029（基线0.0178），均显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了ECG数字化精度，尤其在信号重叠情况下，为研究和临床应用提供了可靠工具。代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过低秩分解条件相关矩阵来学习无向图的方法，解决了大规模数据下的图学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模数据下，传统的图学习方法因计算复杂度高而难以应用，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用低秩分解条件相关矩阵，并结合黎曼优化技术解决优化问题，特别针对GLasso算法的低秩约束版本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实数据上实现了高效的维度与性能平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的低秩图学习方法在大规模数据中表现出色，具有高效的计算性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

Motivation: 无监督强化学习（URL）旨在为未见过的下游任务学习通用技能，但现有的MISL方法缺乏理论分析，无法保证学习技能的多样性和可分离性对下游任务的重要性。

Method: 作者提出了一种新的解耦度量LSEPIN，并基于信息几何理论将KL散度替换为Wasserstein距离，提出了新的技能学习目标WSEP和算法PWSEP。

Result: 理论分析表明，WSEP有助于下游任务适应，并能比MISL发现更多初始策略。PWSEP理论上可以发现所有最优初始策略。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和新提出的方法，论文解决了MISL在技能多样性和可分离性上的不足，为无监督强化学习提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法缺乏显式推理过程，而LLMs虽具备多步推理潜力，但直接使用存在计算成本高、隐私风险等问题。

Method: 提出Time-R1框架：第一阶段监督微调适应任务，第二阶段强化学习优化推理路径，并设计细粒度多目标奖励和GRIP策略。

Result: 实验表明Time-R1在多样数据集上显著提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: Time-R1通过强化微调成功增强了LLMs的时间序列推理能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

Result: 在Ising和TASEP模型上验证了方法的有效性，并揭示了扩散模型潜在空间中的分形相变结构。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解扩散模型潜在空间的复杂结构及其与相变现象的联系提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 研究数据偏移（分布偏移和数据污染）对CoT模型性能的实际影响，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 以k-奇偶问题为例，分析分布偏移和数据污染对CoT分解训练模型性能的联合影响。

Result: 发现CoT在k-奇偶问题中表现比直接预测更差，并揭示了其机制原因。

Conclusion: CoT在数据偏移下可能表现不佳，需进一步研究其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

Method: SPLICE通过斜投影移除敏感概念，同时精确保留其与目标标签的协方差。

Result: 在Bias in Bios和Winobias等基准测试中，SPLICE优于基线方法，移除保护属性时对主任务信息损害最小。

Conclusion: SPLICE是唯一能移除线性概念预测性并保持目标协方差且嵌入失真最小的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在语义丰富的CARTE基准上创下新标准。

Conclusion: ConTextTab成功结合了两种方法的优势，为表格ICL提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE
benchmark.

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的能量函数log-sum-ReLU（LSR），用于密集关联记忆网络，基于Epanechnikov核，实现了精确记忆检索和指数容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有的log-sum-exponential（LSE）函数，解决其需要指数分离函数的限制，同时引入新的局部极小值特性。

Method: 基于Epanechnikov核设计LSR能量函数，通过实验验证其性能。

Result: LSR具有更多局部极小值（记忆），且与LSE模型相比具有相似的对数似然性，表现出创造性和新颖性。

Conclusion: LSR在记忆存储和生成任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

Motivation: 安全部署大型语言模型（LLMs）需要监控高风险交互，但这一领域研究不足。

Method: 评估了多种基于合成数据训练的探针架构，并测试其在真实数据中的泛化能力。

Result: 探针性能与中等规模LLM监控器相当，但计算成本低六个数量级。

Conclusion: 激活探针可作为高效初始过滤器，支持构建资源感知的分层监控系统。

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了动态深度学习系统（DDLSs）的效率鲁棒性，首次提出了效率攻击的综合分类，并分析了现有防御机制的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习系统（DLSs）在实时应用中的部署增加，动态深度学习系统（DDLSs）通过动态调整计算以提高效率，但也引入了新的攻击面。本文旨在探索这些攻击并推动防御策略的发展。

Method: 通过分类效率攻击（基于动态计算、动态迭代和动态输出），深入分析攻击策略，并评估现有防御机制的效果。

Result: 研究发现效率攻击对DDLSs构成显著威胁，现有防御机制存在局限性，需要新的缓解策略。

Conclusion: 未来需要开发更有效的防御机制以保护动态深度学习系统免受效率攻击。

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

Result: 熵正则化能促进约束满足，松弛约束的方法在保持安全性和最优性的同时提高了对扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 熵正则化与鲁棒性的联系为强化学习中的鲁棒安全性提供了简单有效的实现途径。

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

Motivation: 分类器混合物（随机集成）被提出以提高对抗攻击的鲁棒性，但现有攻击方法不适用于此类分类器。本文旨在解决这一问题，并提出更有效的攻击方法。

Method: 通过几何分析定义了攻击的两个理想属性（有效性和最大性），并设计了一种新的攻击方法——"lattice climber attack"，在二元线性设置下提供理论保证。

Result: 实验证明，现有攻击方法无法同时满足有效性和最大性，而新提出的攻击方法在合成和真实数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: "lattice climber attack"是一种在分类器混合物中具有理论保证和实际效果的新型攻击方法，填补了现有攻击方法的不足。

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Duo方法通过迁移高斯扩散技术，显著提升了均匀状态扩散模型的性能，为快速文本生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

TL;DR: NoLoCo是一种新型优化方法，通过部分随机平均模型权重减少通信开销，无需显式同步参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型通常需要高带宽集群，成本高且不实用。现有低通信方法仍需同步步骤，限制了效率。

Method: NoLoCo采用Nesterov动量优化器变体，随机选择部分模型权重进行平均，避免集体通信。

Result: 在125M至6.8B参数范围内，NoLoCo通信开销显著低于现有方法，同步速度快10倍，收敛速度快4%。

Conclusion: NoLoCo在低带宽网络中高效且实用，适用于大规模模型训练。

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

Conclusion: CausalFM为因果推断提供了一种新范式，有望改变医学、经济学等领域的实践方式。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other
disciplines.

Result: PSMs在表达力上接近Transformer架构，同时在推理效率上媲美状态空间模型，某些情况下长度泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: PSMs为神经序列模型提供了一种新的通用框架，兼具高效性和灵活性。

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

Motivation: LLM在招聘决策中的广泛应用可能对职业和生计产生直接影响，但现有偏见缓解方法在现实情境中效果不佳。

Method: 通过识别并中和模型激活中的敏感属性方向，采用内部偏见缓解技术（如仿射概念编辑）。

Result: 在多种商业和开源模型中，现实情境会引发显著偏见（高达12%），而内部缓解方法能将偏见降至1%以下。

Conclusion: 建议招聘中部署LLM时采用更现实的评估方法，并考虑内部偏见缓解策略以实现公平结果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

Result: 实验表明SEAL在知识整合和少样本泛化方面表现良好。

Conclusion: SEAL是实现语言模型自我适应的重要一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our
website and code is available at https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal.

Motivation: 由于法规、版权和隐私需求，LLM的遗忘变得重要，但现有方法容易导致无意遗忘和性能下降。

Method: GUARD引入轻量级数据归因指标，设计自适应非均匀遗忘权重，优化遗忘目标。

Result: 实验显示GUARD显著提升保留性能，减少效用损失，遗忘效果与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: GUARD有效解决了LLM遗忘中的无意遗忘问题，提升了模型实用性。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

Result: 实验表明EG-CFG在多样化编码任务中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: EG-CFG通过执行信号引导生成，显著提升代码生成能力，适用于从基础到复杂任务。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

### [135] [ReGuidance: A Simple Diffusion Wrapper for Boosting Sample Quality on Hard Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10955)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGuidance是一种简单的方法，用于提升扩散模型在逆问题中的样本真实性和奖励表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于预训练扩散模型的方法在低信噪比的逆问题中容易偏离数据流形，导致输出不真实。

Method: 提出ReGuidance，通过反转候选解并重新初始化DPS来改进样本质量。

Result: 在困难的逆问题中，ReGuidance显著提升了样本质量和测量一致性。

Conclusion: ReGuidance是首个为DPS提供严格算法保证的方法，同时提升了奖励和数据流形接近度。

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Result: 变换器在足够训练任务下达到流形上Hölder函数的最小最大回归率，泛化误差随训练任务数变化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了几何在ICL中的作用，为非线性模型ICL研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

Result: Farseer显著提升预测准确性和外推能力，减少外推误差433%，并优化计算分配策略。

Conclusion: Farseer为LLM训练提供可靠预测工具，支持从小规模实验推断大规模性能，并开源所有数据和模型。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

Method: 比较LV损失和rKL-LD损失在扩散桥中的表现，并通过实验验证。

Result: rKL-LD损失在性能和训练稳定性上优于LV损失，且需要更少的超参数优化。

Conclusion: rKL-LD损失是扩散桥中更优的选择，解决了LV损失的概念性问题并提升了性能。

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型在解决逆问题时需要完整的反向扩散过程，且操作于噪声中间状态，导致在非线性求解器（如FWI）中不稳定，影响反演质量。

Method: 提出了一种框架，将预训练的DDPM作为基于分数的生成扩散先验，通过分数重匹配策略直接集成到FWI中，完全在干净的图像空间中进行反演。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在保真度和鲁棒性上优于传统和基于GAN的FWI方法，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单有效的正则化项引入生成扩散先验，提升了FWI的稳定性和反演质量，适用于地震成像和其他逆问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors
for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the
full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states,
which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.
In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those
used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy
velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates
a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based
generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike
traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion
sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in
the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity
models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple
regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal
modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation
and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical
experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and
robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while
remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other
inverse problem tasks.

Result: 最优分类数为37类，其中14类可明确区分，10类已初步解释。分类依赖于信号轨迹形状、散射高度和多普勒速度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且与已知物理机制一致，关键参数为信号轨迹形状、散射高度和多普勒速度。

Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for
processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based
only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio
wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating
the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data
obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for
each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the
classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave
propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the
radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made
using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal
number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The
analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently
separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of
10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and
their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of
solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not
contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most
important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal
ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and
the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.

Method: 通过分析边长度多面体的顶点数与n的因数分解的关系，探讨其对循环旅行商问题的影响。

Result: 发现边长度多面体的顶点数在n为素数时与n成正比，为素数的平方时与n^(3/2)成正比，而为2的幂时则呈超多项式增长。

Conclusion: 边长度多面体的研究为循环旅行商问题提供了新的解决路径，并揭示了其与数论问题的深刻联系。

Abstract: We study the edge-length polytope, motivated both by algorithmic research on
the Circulant Traveling Salesman Problem (Circulant TSP) and number-theoretic
research related to the Buratti-Horak-Rosa conjecture. Circulant TSP is a
special case of TSP whose overall complexity is a significant still-open
question, and where on an input with vertices $\{1, 2, ..., n\}$, the cost of
an edge $\{i, j\}$ depends only on its length $\min\{|i-j|, n-|i-j|\}$. The
edge-length polytope provides one path to solving circulant TSP instances, and
we show that it is intimately connected to the factorization of $n$: the number
of vertices scales with $n$ whenever $n$ is prime and with $n^{3/2}$ whenever
$n$ is a prime-squared, but there are a superpolynomial number of vertices
whenever $n$ is a power of 2. In contrast, the more-standard Symmetric TSP
Polytope has roughly $n!$ vertices. Hence, for Circulant TSP, a brute-force
algorithm checking every vertex is actually efficient in some cases, based on
the factorization of $n$. As an intermediate step, we give superpolynomial
lower-bounds on two combinatorial sequences related to the Buratti-Horak-Rosa
conjecture, which asks what combinations of edge lengths can comprise a
Hamiltonian path.

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent
years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from

methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the
Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1)
classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and
(2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we
design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution
generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification
task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval
task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive
Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task
and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at

Abstract: Identification of critical residues of a protein is actively pursued, since
such residues are essential for protein function. We present three ways of
recognising critical residues of an example protein, the evolution of which is
tracked via molecular dynamical simulations. Our methods are based on learning
a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, where the state variable of each of
156 residues, is attached to a node of this graph, with the RGG learnt using
the matrix of correlations between state variables of each residue-pair. Given
the categorical nature of the state variable, correlation between a residue
pair is computed using Cramer's V. We advance an organic thresholding to learn
an RGG, and compare results against extant thresholding techniques, when
parametrising criticality as the nodal degree in the learnt RGG. Secondly, we
develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between the
posterior probability of the full graph variable defined on all 156 residues,
and that of the graph with all but one residue omitted. A third parametrisation
of criticality informs on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees as the
protein evolves during the simulation. Finally, we compare results obtained
with the three distinct criticality parameters, against
experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

Conclusion: 该框架具有通用性，结合加速技术可解决更复杂的流控制问题。

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain
effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions,
but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the
present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic
lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the
challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. We
demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques --
pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level
transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to
multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best
proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts
increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number
of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with
an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration
and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift
regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord
pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this
advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord
pitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of
the proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach
to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined
with the proposed acceleration techniques.

Abstract: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics drive progress in
various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational
fluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed
convergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring
prohibitive computational costs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
neural operators aim to accelerate PDE solvers using deep learning techniques.
However, PINNs require extensive retraining and careful tuning, and purely
data-driven operators demand large labeled datasets. Hybrid physics-aware
methods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss
functions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing
coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements. To this end, we introduce
OmniFluids, a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that
integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and
few-shot fine-tuning, which enables fast inference and accurate prediction
under limited or zero data supervision. For architectural design, the key
components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder,
and factorized Fourier layers, which enable efficient and scalable modeling of
diverse physical tasks while maintaining seamless integration with
physics-based supervision. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional
benchmarks, OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven
methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy,
delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately
recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work
establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling
in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

Abstract: The high dimensionality of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters poses
major computational challenges for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Traditional
Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow
convergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the
dimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we
adopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity
solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve
sampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate
models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).
These deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical
properties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and
asymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching
them with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our
method achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical
consistency and asymptotic accuracy. The proposed methodology enables efficient
large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ and is validated across both homogeneous
and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes. Numerical results demonstrate improved
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC techniques.

### [148] [The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10872)
*Ziv Scully,Alexander Terenin*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文旨在展示Gittins指数如何实际应用于解决决策问题，尽管其理论定义复杂且适用范围有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gittins指数虽然在理论上能优化多种决策问题，但实际应用较少，本文希望通过实例证明其实用性。

Method: 通过示例驱动的介绍，展示Gittins指数在解决实际问题中的应用，包括贝叶斯优化和队列尾延迟最小化。

Result: Gittins指数在某些问题中能实现最优解，而在另一些问题上虽非最优但表现卓越。

Conclusion: Gittins指数不仅具有理论价值，还能有效解决实际问题，尤其是在贝叶斯优化和队列延迟优化中。

Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of
decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit
problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the
Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions
thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly
optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of
other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often
regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a
practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be
fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven
introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of
problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent
performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the
Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to
minimizing tail latency in queues.

Motivation: 探索SSH模型在更复杂现实条件下的行为，特别是拓扑、无序、非厄米性和时间驱动之间的相互作用。

Method: 使用精确对角化和数值求解器分析系统的谱特性和局域化特征，并通过无监督机器学习（PCA）分类系统相。

Result: 发现强AAH调制会破坏拓扑保护的边缘态，非厄米性导致体态边界局域化，Floquet驱动可设计出具有异常边缘态的拓扑绝缘体。

Conclusion: 广义1D拓扑系统展现出丰富的现象，包括拓扑保护、局域化和非厄米效应，为未来研究提供了多角度视角。

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a
one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex,
realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents
a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models,
exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder,
non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and
specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its
spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse
Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model
exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a
localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH)
modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to
autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization
can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond
Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization
of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to
a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological
insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the
boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a
multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological
systems.

Motivation: 研究固态电池中SEI的原子级反应机制，解决实验表征和模拟精度不足的挑战。

Method: 采用主动学习和深度等变神经网络势能进行大规模反应模拟，结合无监督分类技术分析界面反应。

Result: 发现SEI中新的晶体无序相Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$，解释了锂蠕变机制与实验观察一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为固态合成和电化学中的复杂异质过程提供了原子动力学洞察，无需实验拟合参数。

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the
formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the
viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist
due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and
limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit
reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell,
{\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network
interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and
interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised
classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic
environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported
crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the
SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics,
underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport
kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of
the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite
initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our
approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable
parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain
insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in
solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最小深度的新阈值方案，用于在双重不平衡条件下进行特征选择，提高了随机森林中变量选择的稳定性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高维分类任务中，双重不平衡（类别不平衡和维度不对称）导致传统特征选择方法在随机森林中表现不稳定或产生误导性排名。

Method: 利用最小深度和树拓扑结构评估变量相关性，提出新的阈值方案。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法比传统最小深度选择更简洁且准确。

Conclusion: 该方法为双重不平衡条件下的随机森林变量选择提供了实用且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in high-dimensional classification
tasks, particularly under challenging conditions of double imbalance, namely
settings characterized by both class imbalance in the response variable and
dimensional asymmetry in the data $(n \gg p)$. In such scenarios, traditional
feature selection methods applied to Random Forests (RF) often yield unstable
or misleading importance rankings. This paper proposes a novel thresholding
scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth, which exploits the tree
topology to assess variable relevance. Extensive experiments on simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces more
parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal
depth-based selection. The method provides a practical and interpretable
solution for variable selection in RF under double imbalance conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的新型密度均衡映射框架（LDEM），解决了传统方法在精度、重叠伪影和2D到3D扩展中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密度均衡映射方法存在精度有限、极端情况下产生重叠伪影以及从2D扩展到3D时需重新设计算法的问题。

Method: 利用深度神经网络，设计了一种损失函数以确保密度均匀性和几何规则性，并采用分层方法预测粗粒度和密集级别的变换。

Result: LDEM在多种密度分布下表现出优于传统方法的密度均衡性和双射性，并可轻松应用于表面重网格化。

Conclusion: LDEM为密度均衡映射的规模化、鲁棒计算提供了新可能性，且无需修改模型结构即可从2D扩展到3D。

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖高质量数据集，但低质量图像中蕴含的信息被忽视，研究旨在挖掘这些数据的潜力。

Method: 提出Ambient Diffusion Omni框架，利用图像的光谱功率衰减和局部性，从混合分布中提取信号。

Result: 成功训练出对合成噪声鲁棒的扩散模型，在ImageNet上达到最佳FID，显著提升文本到图像生成的质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 噪声可平衡高质量分布与混合分布的偏差，理论分析验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LightKG是一种基于GNN的KGRS，通过简化GNN层和线性聚合框架解决稀疏性问题，同时引入高效的对比层实现SSL，显著提升推荐精度并减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GNN的KGRS在稀疏交互场景下性能下降，复杂模型和机制（如注意力）可能加剧学习难度。

Method: LightKG采用简化的GNN层（标量对编码）和线性聚合框架，并设计高效的对比层直接最小化节点相似性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，LightKG平均推荐精度提升5.8%，训练时间减少84.3%。

Conclusion: LightKG在稀疏和密集场景下均优于现有KGRS，同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for
Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven
effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training
time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to
other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior
performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models
tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,
like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning
difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet
powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a
simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather
than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly
reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an
efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node
similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation
and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and
dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it
surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8\% in recommendation accuracy
and saves 84.3\% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL. Our code is
available at https://github.com/1371149/LightKG.

TL;DR: SHORE是一种新的LTV预测框架，通过整合短期预测作为辅助任务来提升长期预测准确性，并采用混合损失函数减少异常值影响，实验显示其显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字游戏中长期用户价值预测对盈利策略至关重要，但现有方法因延迟支付、数据稀疏和异常值等问题表现不佳。

Method: 提出SHORE框架，结合短期预测作为辅助任务，并设计混合损失函数（保留顺序的多分类和动态Huber损失）以处理零膨胀和异常值。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，SHORE显著优于基线方法，在线部署中预测误差相对减少47.91%。

Conclusion: SHORE在工业级LTV预测中具有实际有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In digital gaming, long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction is
essential for monetization strategy, yet presents major challenges due to
delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and the presence of
high-value outliers. While existing models typically rely on either short-cycle
observations or strong distributional assumptions, such approaches often
underestimate long-term value or suffer from poor robustness. To address these
issues, we propose SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression
(SHORE), a novel LTV prediction framework that integrates short-horizon
predictions (e.g., LTV-15 and LTV-30) as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle
targets (e.g., LTV-60). SHORE also introduces a hybrid loss function combining
order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to
mitigate the influence of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.
Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91\%
relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment. These results
highlight SHORE's practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale
LTV prediction for digital games.

Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant
challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs.
Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures,
relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding
graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In
this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first
approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific
macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts.
Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the
first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information
effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate
macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering
multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender
system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark
datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning
methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based
recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE
in billion-scale recommender systems.

Motivation: 减少海洋生态系统模型自旋过程所需的计算时间和资源。

Method: 利用CVAE从少量生物地球化学参数映射到三维稳态年周期，预测初始值用于自旋。

Result: 预测初始值将自旋迭代次数减少50-95%，优于使用训练数据均值。

Conclusion: CVAE预测初始值显著加速自旋过程，但预测结果的年周期性仍需改进。

Abstract: We used precomputed steady states obtained by a spin-up for a global marine
ecosystem model as training data to build a mapping from the small number of
biogeochemical model parameters onto the three-dimensional converged steady
annual cycle. The mapping was performed by a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. Applied for test data, we show that
the prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good
approximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the
predictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained
in the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values
for a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,
corresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the
spin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally
uniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied
stopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution. The savings in
needed iterations and, thus, computing time for the spin-up ranges from 50 to
95\%, depending on the stopping criterion for the spin-up. We compared these
results with the use of the mean of the training data as an initial value. We
found that this also accelerates the spin-up, but only by a much lower factor.

Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is
essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on
large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or
lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we
present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model,
NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent
worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest
heatwave, our method produces temperature anomalies up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above
the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature
intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns--hallmarks
of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate
models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing
a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather
under climate change.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine
learning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations
such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute
sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a
scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome
these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically
generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude
encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands
representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural
Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,
uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights
demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to
quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational
advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum
architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through
extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge
states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating
resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This
research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework,
advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional
computing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond.

smaller models. Dual Attention Vision Transformer-Base (DaViT-B) obtained the
best results, with an f1-score of 96.4%, and is recommended as the most
efficient architecture for automated psoriasis detection. This article
reinforces the potential of ViTs for medical image classification tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SPARKE的方法，通过条件熵实现提示感知的多样性控制，解决了提示引导扩散模型中生成样本多样性不足的问题，并显著降低了计算复杂度。


<details>

Conclusion: SPARKE方法有效解决了提示感知多样性问题，并通过计算优化支持大规模生成，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标记数据有限时判别器性能不足的问题，利用扩散模型的分数组合特性生成高质量合成样本。

Method: 通过凸组合扩散采样中不同类别的分数生成合成样本，并研究类别选择策略对性能的影响。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升判别器性能，且发现混合类别在判别器嵌入空间中距离较远时效果更佳。

Conclusion: ScoreMix无需大量参数搜索即可显著提升性能，为训练判别模型提供了一种实用且高效的方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球最常见的癌症，手动生成SOAP笔记耗时且导致医生疲劳，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用弱监督多模态框架，结合病变图像和稀疏临床文本生成SOAP笔记。

Result: 性能与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro相当，并引入MedConceptEval和CCS评估临床质量。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展且临床实用，显著减轻医生负担并减少标注数据需求。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Result: 改进后的模型在语言和视觉任务中表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性，同时提升了长序列理解能力。

Conclusion: 本文为自注意力机制提供了更深入的理论解释，并通过改进架构展示了其实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理模态缺失和分布外数据时存在局限性，依赖特定模型或引入过多参数，实用性不足。

Method: CIDer包含模型特定自蒸馏模块（MSSD）和模型无关因果推断模块（MACI），分别增强鲁棒性和处理OOD数据。

Result: 实验表明CIDer在RMFM和OOD场景下表现优异，参数更少且训练更快。

Conclusion: CIDer为多模态情感识别提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

Result: 在EgoObjects数据集上验证，HyperCLIC在多粒度任务中表现优异，提升了层次泛化能力。

Conclusion: HyperCLIC有效解决了实例和类别的分层持续学习问题，为现实场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

Conclusion: M4V在降低计算成本的同时，有效提升了文本到视频生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

Motivation: 现有方法将视觉序列构建为空间块进行自回归生成，但图像块本质上是并行的，与自回归建模的因果性相矛盾。

Method: 提出SpectralAR框架，通过嵌套频谱标记化将图像转换为有序频谱标记，并按从低频到高频的顺序进行自回归生成。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上的图像重建和自回归生成实验中，SpectralAR仅用64个标记和310M参数就达到了3.02 gFID。

Conclusion: SpectralAR通过频谱视角实现了视觉序列的因果性和高效生成，无需额外复杂设计。

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

Conclusion: 首次在扩散模型中进行了头级别的注意力扰动分析，揭示了注意力层的可解释性专业化，并提供了有效的扰动策略设计。

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

Conclusion: SWDL-Net为医学图像分割提供了一种高效的半监督学习解决方案，显著减少了对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been

Result: 在低SNR和有限计算资源下，分类准确率比现有方法提高10%。

Conclusion: 该框架在动态环境下表现优越，适用于IoT设备和边缘服务器的联合处理。

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational
limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for
server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network
(DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and
transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods
rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to
varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless
image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a
learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently
explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under
given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the
infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT
device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to
avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application
specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures
and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited
computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy
as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR
as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M
FLOPs) at IoT device.

### [177] [Multi-dimensional Autoscaling of Processing Services: A Comparison of Agent-based Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10420)
*Boris Sedlak,Alireza Furutanpey,Zihang Wang,Víctor Casamayor Pujol,Schahram Dustdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于代理的边缘计算自动扩展框架，通过动态调整硬件资源和内部服务配置，在资源受限环境中最大化需求满足。比较了四种扩展代理的性能，结果表明多维代理方法在边缘环境中可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动扩展方法在边缘计算中因资源限制而失效，需要更灵活的扩展行为。

Method: 引入基于代理的自动扩展框架，动态调整硬件资源和内部服务配置，比较了四种代理（Active Inference、Deep Q Network、Analysis of Structural Knowledge、Deep Active Inference）的性能。

Result: 所有代理均能实现可接受的SLO性能，但收敛模式不同。Deep Q Network受益于预训练，结构分析收敛快，Deep Active Inference兼具理论和实践优势。

Conclusion: 多维代理自动扩展在边缘环境中可行，未来研究可进一步探索此方向。

Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple
elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling
framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service
configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained
environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

### [178] [The Alignment Trap: Complexity Barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10304)
*Jasper Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文揭示了AI安全性验证在系统能力提升时的计算复杂性障碍，证明验证问题在系统表达能力超过临界值时是coNP完全的，且需要指数时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统能力提升与安全性验证之间的根本矛盾，揭示验证复杂性与系统表达能力的关系。

Method: 通过形式化Capability-Risk Scaling动态，提出四个核心定理，证明验证复杂性与系统表达能力的关系。

Result: 验证复杂性随系统表达能力指数增长，安全策略在策略空间中占比极小，且现有对齐技术无法提供全面覆盖。

Conclusion: AI发展面临三难选择：限制系统复杂性、接受不可验证风险或开发新的安全范式。

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

### [179] [A Benchmark for Generalizing Across Diverse Team Strategies in Competitive Pokémon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10326)
*Cameron Angliss,Jiaxun Cui,Jiaheng Hu,Arrasy Rahman,Peter Stone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了VGC-Bench基准，用于评估AI代理在多智能体学习中的泛化能力，特别是在宝可梦VGC这种高组合复杂度的环境中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够适应不同策略环境的AI代理是多智能体学习的核心挑战，宝可梦VGC因其极高的组合复杂度成为理想测试平台。

Method: 引入VGC-Bench基准，提供基础设施、标准化评估协议、人类游戏数据集及多种基线方法（如大语言模型、行为克隆、强化学习等）。

Result: 在单一团队配置下，方法能击败专业选手，但随着团队规模扩大，泛化能力显著下降。

Conclusion: 跨团队策略的泛化仍是开放挑战，VGC-Bench为社区提供了研究工具。

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team
configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC
competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively
larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the
single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy
generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the
community. Our code is open sourced at

### [180] [Data Driven Diagnosis for Large Cyber-Physical-Systems with Minimal Prior Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10613)
*Henrik Sebastian Steude,Alexander Diedrich,Ingo Pill,Lukas Moddemann,Daniel Vranješ,Oliver Niggemann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的诊断方法，仅需少量先验知识即可对复杂信息物理系统进行诊断，结合神经网络和图形算法，实验效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂信息物理系统诊断中需要大量先验知识的问题。

Method: 结合基于神经网络的症状生成器和图形诊断算法，仅需子系统关系的基本信息和正常操作数据。

Result: 在模拟数据集中，82%的情况下包含真实因果组件，73%的场景中有效缩小搜索空间；真实数据集测试也显示实用潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法在缺乏先验知识的复杂系统中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

### [181] [OPT-BENCH: Evaluating LLM Agent on Large-Scale Search Spaces Optimization Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10764)
*Xiaozhe Li,Jixuan Chen,Xinyu Fang,Shengyuan Ding,Haodong Duan,Qingwen Liu,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OPT-BENCH是一个评估LLM代理在迭代优化任务中表现的基准，包含20个Kaggle机器学习任务和10个NP问题，并提出了OPT-Agent框架。实验表明，历史反馈显著提升了优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在通过历史反馈迭代优化复杂解决方案方面的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出了OPT-BENCH基准和OPT-Agent框架，通过生成、验证和迭代改进解决方案来模拟人类推理。

Result: 实验表明，历史反馈显著提升了LLM在机器学习和NP任务中的优化性能。

Conclusion: OPT-BENCH和OPT-Agent为LLM驱动的迭代优化提供了有效工具，推动了相关研究的进展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex
solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently
explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization
problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from
Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging
environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution
refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an
end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling
complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions
through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on
solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating
historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both
ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to
promote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative
reasoning. Project page:

### [182] [Spurious Rewards: Rethinking Training Signals in RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10947)
*Rulin Shao,Shuyue Stella Li,Rui Xin,Scott Geng,Yiping Wang,Sewoong Oh,Simon Shaolei Du,Nathan Lambert,Sewon Min,Ranjay Krishna,Yulia Tsvetkov,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Pang Wei Koh,Luke Zettlemoyer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR（带可验证奖励的强化学习）能在某些模型中激发强数学推理能力，即使奖励信号与正确答案相关性低、无相关性或负相关。Qwen2.5-Math-7B在MATH-500上表现显著提升，但其他模型家族（如Llama3或OLMo2）未见类似效果。代码推理是Qwen2.5-Math的独特行为，RLVR后频率显著增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RLVR在数学推理任务中的潜力，尤其是奖励信号与正确答案无关时是否能激发模型能力。

Method: 使用RLVR训练模型，测试不同奖励信号（随机、格式、错误标签等）对模型性能的影响。

Result: Qwen2.5-Math-7B性能显著提升，但其他模型未见类似效果。代码推理频率从65%增至90%以上。

Conclusion: RLVR可能利用了预训练中学到的有用推理表示，但机制尚不明确。未来研究需验证多样模型，而非单一选择。

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

### [183] [Patient-Specific Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automatic Replanning in Head-and-Neck Cancer Proton Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10073)
*Malvern Madondo,Yuan Shao,Yingzi Liu,Jun Zhou,Xiaofeng Yang,Zhen Tian*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习的自动化IMPT重新规划框架，通过个性化训练和奖励机制提升治疗质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头颈癌IMPT治疗中解剖结构变化可能导致剂量分布问题，手动重新规划耗时耗力。

Method: 使用深度强化学习（DRL）框架，基于患者CT和模拟解剖变化训练个性化代理，优化优先级调整。

Result: DRL代理显著提升初始计划分数，优于人工重新规划，临床验证显示更好的肿瘤覆盖和器官保护。

Conclusion: DRL在自适应质子治疗中具有潜力，为高效离线适应和在线适应提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for
head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and
organ-at-risk overdosing. As a result, treatment replanning is often required
to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual
replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a
patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT
replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality
score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning
process as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust
optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based
approaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using
their planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating
anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific
approach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling
effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network
and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state
representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.
Evaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL
agents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \pm
6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by
a human planner ($137.20 \pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms that
improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse
anatomical changes. This work demonstrates DRL's potential in addressing
geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering
efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton
therapy.

*Olga Ovcharenko,Florian Barkmann,Philip Toma,Imant Daunhawer,Julia Vogt,Sebastian Schelter,Valentina Boeva*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: scSSL-Bench是一个评估19种自监督学习方法在单细胞数据上的综合基准，涵盖9个数据集和3个下游任务，揭示了任务特定的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动自监督学习在单细胞数据中的应用，填补多模态数据整合框架的空白。

Method: 评估19种自监督学习方法，分析数据增强策略，聚焦于批次校正、细胞类型注释和缺失模态预测。

Result: 专用框架（如scVI）在批次校正中表现优异，通用方法（如VICReg）在细胞类型和多模态任务中更优；随机掩码是最佳增强技术。

Conclusion: 需开发专用多模态整合框架，scSSL-Bench为单细胞分析中的自监督学习提供了标准化评估和建议。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for
extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To
advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we
present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data
integration framework. scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform
and concrete recommendations for applying SSL to single-cell analysis,
advancing the convergence of deep learning and single-cell genomics.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Nullsettes的任务集，用于评估基因组语言模型（gLM）预测功能突变的能力，发现模型性能与序列长度和序列似然性密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索gLM如何学习序列到功能的关系，以生成功能性DNA序列用于合成生物学。

Method: 通过Nullsettes任务集评估12种先进模型预测功能突变的能力，分析模型性能与序列似然性和长度的关系。

Result: 发现模型性能与序列似然性高度相关，且性能预测范围受序列长度影响显著。

Conclusion: 使用gLM进行突变效应预测时，需同时考虑序列似然性和序列长度。

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when
using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效算法，用于从大型非均匀数据集中识别同质子集（子队列），并设计了一个简单的测试来识别乳腺癌患者中的同质子集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别同质子集有助于发现疾病通路和治疗方法，特别是针对特定子队列的研究。

Method: 采用类似于Goemans和Williamson（1994）的舍入技术，近似解决优化问题，近似因子为0.82。

Result: 算法成功应用于乳腺癌RNA微阵列数据集，识别出主要由转移病例组成的同质子集，并发现甲基化水平与核受体表达的显著变化共现的子队列。

Conclusion: 该算法为识别同质子集提供了有效工具，有助于精准医学研究和治疗开发。

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for
identifying homogeneous subsets (equivalently subcohorts) from large
inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique,
similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal
solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As
an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

TL;DR: Resa是一种1.5B推理模型，通过稀疏自编码器调优（SAE-Tuning）高效提取推理能力，显著降低训练成本和时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何高效且低成本地从语言模型中提取和增强推理能力。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）从源模型中捕获推理能力，并指导目标模型的监督微调过程。

Result: SAE-Tuning在极低成本（约1美元）和短时间（约20分钟）内实现接近RL训练模型的推理性能（>97%），并在轻量RL训练后进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning提取的推理能力具有通用性和模块化特性，可跨数据集和模型应用，且无需重新训练。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Result: 展示了该框架在文本、图像和音频生成评估中的广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined

trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

Method: 通过模拟Gibbs采样实验，分析语言模型在不同条件下的决策模式，并提出区分随机与确定性行为的方法。

Result: 发现语言模型在非零采样温度下仍可能产生最大似然估计，表明其决策可以是确定性的。模拟Gibbs采样可能导致错误的先验推断。

Conclusion: 语言模型的决策行为可能更倾向于确定性，需谨慎使用模拟Gibbs采样以避免误导性先验。研究为理解大型语言模型的决策机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ClusterUCB性能接近原始梯度方法，同时显著降低计算消耗。

Conclusion: ClusterUCB是一种高效且实用的数据选择框架，适用于大规模语言模型的微调。

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

TL;DR: PAG框架通过多轮强化学习让大语言模型在生成和验证角色间切换，选择性修正错误，提升推理和验证能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证方法依赖额外验证模型或多阶段训练，扩展性受限，需更高效的自验证方法。

Method: 提出PAG框架，结合生成与验证角色，通过选择性修正机制在多轮强化学习中优化模型表现。

Result: 实验显示PAG在推理和验证任务中均表现优异，生成和自修正准确率提升，自验证优于自一致性。

Conclusion: PAG为LLMs提供了一种简单高效的自验证框架，显著提升模型性能，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

Motivation: 检测生命威胁性语言对保护个体、促进心理健康和预防潜在危害至关重要。

Method: 使用Gemma、Mistral和Llama-2三种开源LLMs的7B参数变体，在不同数据集（平衡、不平衡和极端不平衡）上进行微调，并与传统方法（如词袋、词嵌入、主题建模和BERT）进行比较。

Result: LLMs表现优于传统方法，Mistral和Llama-2在平衡和不平衡数据场景中表现最佳，Gemma稍逊。上采样技术对传统方法有益，但对LLMs影响较小。

Conclusion: LLMs在现实世界生命威胁性语言检测问题中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

TL;DR: PREMISE框架通过提示优化减少大型推理模型（LRMs）的冗余计算，保持准确性同时显著降低token使用和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型的链式推理（CoT）冗长，导致token使用和成本过高，限制了在延迟敏感或API受限环境中的部署。

Method: PREMISE结合轨迹级诊断和梯度启发式提示优化，通过多目标文本搜索平衡token长度和答案有效性。

Result: 在GSM8K、SVAMP和Math500上，PREMISE保持或提升基线准确性（如Claude 96%→96%，Gemini 91%→92%），同时减少87.5%的推理token，降低成本69%-82%。

Conclusion: 提示级优化是高效LRM推理的可扩展路径，无需牺牲推理质量。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

Motivation: 现有的dLLMs采样策略（如基于置信度或半自回归解码）存在静态行为问题，导致效率低下和灵活性不足。

Method: 提出SlowFast Sampling策略，遵循三个原则（确定性、收敛性和位置性），并结合dLLM-Cache减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验表明，SlowFast Sampling在LLaDA上实现了最高15.63倍的加速，结合缓存后可达34.22倍，且准确率下降极小。

Conclusion: SlowFast Sampling展示了通过优化采样策略可以充分发挥dLLMs的潜力，实现快速且高质量的生成。

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Motivation: 理解LLMs在微调过程中表现出的泛化能力和幻觉行为的根源，揭示其背后的机制。

Method: 通过实验验证OCR在五种主流LLMs中的作用，并设计合成事实回忆任务，分析单层单头注意力变换器的表现。

Result: OCR机制驱动了泛化和幻觉行为，矩阵分解在任务解决中起关键作用，梯度下降的隐式偏置解释了OCR的高效学习能力。

Conclusion: 研究为理解OCR现象提供了理论基础，为分析和缓解知识注入中的不良行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于半非负矩阵分解（SNMF）的方法，用于分解LLM中的MLP激活，以识别可解释的特征，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期研究聚焦于单个神经元，但发现其常编码多个概念，因此转向分析激活空间中的方向。现有方法如稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在因果评估中表现不佳且缺乏内在可解释性。

Method: 使用半非负矩阵分解（SNMF）直接分解MLP激活，学习稀疏线性组合的神经元特征，并将其映射到激活输入，提升可解释性。

Result: 在Llama 3.1、Gemma 2和GPT-2上的实验显示，SNMF特征在因果引导和人类可解释性上优于SAEs和监督基线。

Conclusion: SNMF是一种简单有效的工具，可用于识别LLM中的可解释特征和剖析概念表示。

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法在数据分布对齐和计算效率方面存在不足，Domain2Vec旨在通过元域分解和训练自由的方式解决这些问题。

Method: Domain2Vec使用分类器将数据集分解为元域向量，基于分布对齐假设（DA²）优化数据混合。

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

Conclusion: AutoMind为全自动化数据科学提供了高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

Conclusion: 结合AI与专家决策（EITL）可提升网络安全效率，为AI辅助漏洞检测系统部署奠定基础。

Abstract: As cyber threats become more sophisticated, rapid and accurate vulnerability
detection is essential for maintaining secure systems. This study explores the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software vulnerability assessment by
simulating the identification of Python code with known Common Weakness
Enumerations (CWEs), comparing zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot
in-domain prompting strategies. Our results indicate that while zero-shot
prompting performs poorly, few-shot prompting significantly enhances
classification performance, particularly when integrated with confidence-based
routing strategies that improve efficiency by directing human experts to cases
where model uncertainty is high, optimizing the balance between automation and
expert oversight. We find that LLMs can effectively generalize across
vulnerability categories with minimal examples, suggesting their potential as
scalable, adaptable cybersecurity tools in simulated environments. However,
challenges such as model reliability, interpretability, and adversarial
robustness remain critical areas for future research. By integrating AI-driven
approaches with expert-in-the-loop (EITL) decision-making, this work highlights
a pathway toward more efficient and responsive cybersecurity workflows. Our
findings provide a foundation for deploying AI-assisted vulnerability detection
systems in both real and simulated environments that enhance operational
resilience while reducing the burden on human analysts.

Motivation: 现有反编译工具输出存在语法和语义错误，且可读性差，LLM虽被用于改进但存在新错误和验证不可靠的问题。

Method: D-LiFT结合强化学习训练LLM，通过D-SCORE系统多维度评估反编译代码，优先确保准确性再优化可读性。

Result: 在Ghidra和多个LLM上实现，D-LiFT比未优化的基线模型多改进了55.3%的函数。

Conclusion: D-LiFT通过D-SCORE驱动的强化学习，显著提升了反编译代码的质量和可读性。

Abstract: Decompilers, which reconstruct human-readable source code from binary
executables, are vital to many security tasks. Yet, despite recent advances,
their output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains
difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs),
researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output.
Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations,
such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.
In this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that
harnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving
accuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of
decompiled code: \textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}.
Central to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system
to score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle,
D-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher
scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically,
D-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler
and symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then
evaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with
the original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for
fine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs,
demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the
coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without
D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled
functions, as measured by D-SCORE.

Abstract: Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to
specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and
software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to
construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large
Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based
fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over
fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels
the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance.
Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of
real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2)
synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and
semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared
ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized
by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more
coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also
used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of
cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are
exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the
fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to
62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers
synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical
structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results
present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and
extensible input generation for fuzzing.

*Yeonwoo Jang,Shariqah Hossain,Ashwin Sreevatsa,Diogo Cruz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究发现某些机器学习遗忘方法在简单提示攻击下可能失效，部分方法如ELM仍易受攻击，而RMU和TAR表现稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战现有遗忘方法的有效性假设，揭示其可能仅抑制输出而非真正移除知识。

Method: 系统评估八种遗忘技术，采用输出、logit和探针分析验证知识可检索性。

Result: ELM在特定提示攻击下恢复57.3%准确率，logit分析显示知识未被隐藏。

Conclusion: 需开发可靠评估框架区分真实知识移除与输出抑制，并公开了评估工具。

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

*Junhua Lin,Marc Juarez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对Tree-Ring水印技术的新型攻击方法，仅需利用公开的变分自编码器即可显著降低检测器的AUC值，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree-Ring水印技术因其高隐蔽性和抗攻击性而受到关注，但现有攻击方法依赖于强假设。本文旨在探索一种更实际的攻击方式，仅需公开的变分自编码器即可实现高效攻击。

Method: 通过利用训练目标扩散模型时使用的变分自编码器，攻击者可以近似模型的潜在空间，从而实施基于代理的攻击。

Result: 攻击使Tree-Ring检测器的ROC和PR曲线的AUC值分别从0.993降至0.153和0.994降至0.385，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了使用公开自编码器训练扩散模型的风险，并指出Tree-Ring检测器的精度在实际应用中不足。

Abstract: We present a novel attack specifically designed against Tree-Ring, a
watermarking technique for diffusion models known for its high imperceptibility
and robustness against removal attacks. Unlike previous removal attacks, which
rely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only
requires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the
target diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By
leveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the
model's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based
attacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction
in the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to
0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image
quality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full
access to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing
public autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by
current industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring
detector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous
evaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于梯度的对抗攻击对汽车入侵检测系统（IDS）的可行性和影响，考虑了白盒、灰盒和黑盒三种攻击场景，并评估了攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代车辆的安全性日益重要，但CAN总线缺乏强大的安全措施，使其易受网络攻击。尽管已有IDS应对威胁，但对抗攻击（如规避攻击）仍能绕过检测。

Method: 研究了三种攻击场景（白盒、灰盒、黑盒），评估了攻击对先进IDS的有效性，并分析了对抗扰动对攻击的影响。

Result: 结果表明，攻击的有效性取决于数据集质量、目标IDS和攻击者的知识程度，且攻击在汽车领域具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 对抗攻击对汽车IDS的威胁不容忽视，未来需改进防御措施以应对不同攻击场景。

Abstract: The security of modern vehicles has become increasingly important, with the
controller area network (CAN) bus serving as a critical communication backbone
for various Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The absence of robust security
measures in CAN, coupled with the increasing connectivity of vehicles, makes
them susceptible to cyberattacks. While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been developed to counter such threats, they are not foolproof. Adversarial
attacks, particularly evasion attacks, can manipulate inputs to bypass
detection by IDSs. This paper extends our previous work by investigating the
feasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks performed with
different degrees of knowledge against automotive IDSs. We consider three
scenarios: white-box (attacker with full system knowledge), grey-box (partial
system knowledge), and the more realistic black-box (no knowledge of the IDS'
internal workings or data). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
attacks against state-of-the-art IDSs on two publicly available datasets.
Additionally, we study effect of the adversarial perturbation on the attack
impact and evaluate real-time feasibility by precomputing evasive payloads for
timed injection based on bus traffic. Our results demonstrate that, besides
attacks being challenging due to the automotive domain constraints, their
effectiveness is strongly dependent on the dataset quality, the target IDS, and
the attacker's degree of knowledge.

Method: 利用样本压缩技术和基于傅里叶的新方法，从噪声观测中恢复分布。

Result: 证明了算法在特定样本量下能以高概率输出接近真实单纯形的结果，并给出了信息理论下界。

Conclusion: 在特定信噪比条件下，噪声情况下的复杂度与无噪声情况一致，方法具有潜在广泛适用性。

Abstract: In this paper, we establish sample complexity bounds for learning
high-dimensional simplices in $\mathbb{R}^K$ from noisy data. Specifically, we
consider $n$ i.i.d. samples uniformly drawn from an unknown simplex in
$\mathbb{R}^K$, each corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of unknown variance.
We prove an algorithm exists that, with high probability, outputs a simplex
within $\ell_2$ or total variation (TV) distance at most $\varepsilon$ from the
true simplex, provided $n \ge (K^2/\varepsilon^2)
e^{\mathcal{O}(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2)}$, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ is the signal-to-noise
ratio. Extending our prior work~\citep{saberi2023sample}, we derive new
information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that simplex estimation within TV
distance $\varepsilon$ requires at least $n \ge \Omega(K^3
\sigma^2/\varepsilon^2 + K/\varepsilon)$ samples, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the
noise variance. In the noiseless scenario, our lower bound $n \ge
\Omega(K/\varepsilon)$ matches known upper bounds up to constant factors. We
resolve an open question by demonstrating that when $\mathrm{SNR} \ge
\Omega(K^{1/2})$, noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case. Our
analysis leverages sample compression techniques (Ashtiani et al., 2018) and
introduces a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy
observations, potentially applicable beyond simplex learning.

Result: 3MSBM在多个实际应用中表现出色，显著优于现有方法，能够更好地捕捉复杂动态和时域依赖。

Conclusion: 3MSBM为多边际设置下的匹配框架训练开辟了新途径，具有更好的收敛性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample
snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g.,
single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge
and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise
interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture
long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the
inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{Momentum
Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching
framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that
satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the
dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned
on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal
control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a
variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal
conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that
preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving
convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of
real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to
existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies,
opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal
settings.

Conclusion: 分布约束对手框架为在线学习提供了更灵活的分析工具，揭示了函数类与分布约束之间的相互作用对可学习性的影响。

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from
adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks
including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more
general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in
which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some
constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we
consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained
understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully
adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a
characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context
against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the
types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on
adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and
generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for
several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be
achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other
words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary
within learnable distribution classes.

Result: 在CIFAR10数据集上验证，发现语义信息传递在扩散中间阶段最高，且不同类别的熵率分布存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 不同类别的语义决策发生在不同中间时间点，揭示了扩散模型中语义信息的动态特性。

Abstract: It is well known that semantic and structural features of the generated
images emerge at different times during the reverse dynamics of diffusion, a
phenomenon that has been connected to physical phase transitions in magnets and
other materials. In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic
approach to measure when these class-semantic "decisions" are made during the
generative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian
classifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the
noisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest
information transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time
derivative of the conditional entropy. We demonstrate our method on
one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and on DDPM models trained on the
CIFAR10 dataset. As expected, we find that the semantic information transfer is
highest in the intermediate stages of diffusion while vanishing during the
final stages. However, we found sizable differences between the entropy rate
profiles of different classes, suggesting that different "semantic decisions"
are located at different intermediate times.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Box-Constrained Softmax（BCSoftmax）函数，用于在输出概率上强制施加上下界约束，解决了传统Softmax无法硬约束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Softmax函数通过温度参数提供软控制，但无法满足某些应用中需要硬约束（如上下界）的需求，影响了模型的可靠性和可信度。

Method: 提出BCSoftmax函数，通过解决一个带约束的优化问题实现输出概率的上下界控制，并开发了高效计算算法。

Result: 在TinyImageNet、CIFAR-100和20NewsGroups数据集上实验验证，校准指标得到提升。

Conclusion: BCSoftmax及其校准方法能有效增强模型的可靠性和下游决策任务的性能。

Abstract: Controlling the output probabilities of softmax-based models is a common
problem in modern machine learning. Although the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function
provides soft control via its temperature parameter, it lacks the ability to
enforce hard constraints, such as box constraints, on output probabilities,
which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and
trustworthy models. In this work, we propose the box-constrained softmax
($\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$) function, a novel generalization of the
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on
output probabilities. While $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$ is formulated as the solution
to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient
computation algorithm for $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. As a key application, we
introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. The
proposed methods mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive
models by learning the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities or
logits after model training, thereby enhancing reliability in downstream
decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods
experimentally using the TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets,
achieving improvements in calibration metrics.

Motivation: 探索更灵活的自适应离策略学习框架，以迭代优化策略并收集更高质量数据。

Method: 基于PAC-Bayesian理论和LS估计器，提出适应动态场景的改进方法。

Result: 在静态和动态场景中均表现优异，尤其在允许中间策略部署时显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 自适应数据收集和PAC-Bayesian框架的结合具有显著优势。

Abstract: Off-policy learning serves as the primary framework for learning optimal
policies from logged interactions collected under a static behavior policy. In
this work, we investigate the more practical and flexible setting of adaptive
off-policy learning, where policies are iteratively refined and re-deployed to
collect higher-quality data. Building on the success of PAC-Bayesian learning
with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) in static settings, we extend this framework to
the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that a principled adjustment to the LS estimator naturally
accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates
under mild conditions. Our method matches the performance of leading offline
approaches in static settings, and significantly outperforms them when
intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across
diverse scenarios highlight both the advantages of adaptive data collection and
the strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.

Result: 提出的估计器在理论和实验中均表现出较低的方差，且简单易用。

Conclusion: 新方法在A/B测试中显著降低了方差，尤其适用于相似系统的比较，具有实用价值。

Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating
the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a
baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each
exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the
difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the
commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.
We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower
variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the
estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and
offers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit
similarities. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 谱特征方法在特定条件下表现优异，但在谱对齐弱或工具变量弱时效果不佳，实验验证了这一分类。

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden
confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A
leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning
the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We
derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator
based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and
failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to
a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This
occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is
well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled
with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument.
Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but
rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly
more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario,
weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the
eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate
this taxonomy.

probably approximately correct labels: with high probability, the overall
labeling error is small. This solution enables rigorous yet efficient dataset
curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology
through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with
pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.

Result: 引导强度$w$会放大类别特定区域并抑制共享区域，且在1D和2D中表现出不同的行为。高$w$时，总变差（TV）的衰减速率呈双指数关系。

Conclusion: 引导不仅影响输出分布的形状，还控制采样轨迹的动态行为，理论分析得到了实验支持。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit
solution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the
sampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data
distribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a
specific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses
regions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength
$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.
Notably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We
also show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation
($\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for
both $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in
shaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the
sampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that
illustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统的安全验证需要准确建模驾驶场景参数的联合概率分布，传统方法（如高斯混合模型或高斯Copula模型）在表达多模态数据或灵活建模依赖关系上存在不足。

Method: 提出高斯混合Copula模型，结合高斯混合模型的多模态能力和Copula的灵活性，分别建模边缘分布和依赖关系。使用联合国第157号法规定义的驾驶场景数据，对比高斯混合模型和高斯Copula模型。

Result: 在1800万个场景实例的评估中，高斯混合Copula模型在似然和Sinkhorn距离上均表现更优。

Conclusion: 高斯混合Copula模型为未来基于场景的验证框架提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器人运动与颗粒地形交互的基本原理，为复杂地形中的机器人导航提供支持。

Method: 集成降维（ST-HOSVD）、代理建模（高斯过程）和数据同化（降阶粒子滤波）技术，利用离线高保真模拟数据和稀疏实验数据。

Result: 计算时间大幅减少，预测精度接近模拟；结合实验数据后，长期预测优于纯模拟。

Conclusion: 该方法在机器人导航和未知地形探索中具有潜力，并能复现物理模拟的尺度关系。

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

*Jun Bai,Rajib Rana,Di Wu,Youyang Qu,Xiaohui Tao,Ji Zhang*

TL;DR: FedMLAC是一个统一框架，通过双向知识蒸馏和层剪枝聚合策略，解决了联邦音频分类中的数据异构性、模型异构性和数据中毒问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦音频分类面临数据异构性、模型异构性和数据中毒三大挑战，现有方法缺乏统一解决方案。

Method: 提出FedMLAC框架，采用双模型架构（个性化本地模型和轻量级全局插件模型），结合双向知识蒸馏和层剪枝聚合策略。

Result: 在四个音频分类基准测试中，FedMLAC在分类准确性和抗噪性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedMLAC为联邦音频分类提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving paradigm for training
audio classification (AC) models across distributed clients without sharing raw
data. However, Federated Audio Classification (FedAC) faces three critical
challenges that substantially hinder performance: data heterogeneity, model
heterogeneity, and data poisoning. While prior works have attempted to address
these issues, they are typically treated independently, lacking a unified and
robust solution suited to real-world federated audio scenarios. To bridge this
gap, we propose FedMLAC, a unified mutual learning framework designed to
simultaneously tackle these challenges in FedAC. Specifically, FedMLAC
introduces a dual-model architecture on each client, comprising a personalized
local AC model and a lightweight, globally shared Plug-in model. Through
bidirectional knowledge distillation, the Plug-in model enables global
knowledge transfer while adapting to client-specific data distributions, thus
supporting both generalization and personalization. To further enhance
robustness against corrupted audio data, we develop a Layer-wise Pruning
Aggregation (LPA) strategy that filters unreliable Plug-in model updates based
on parameter deviations during server-side aggregation. Extensive experiments
on four diverse audio classification benchmarks, spanning both speech and
non-speech tasks, demonstrate that FedMLAC consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness to
noisy data.

*Rogier C. van Dalen,Shucong Zhang,Titouan Parcollet,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合条件熵和说话人编码的方法，用于在少量未标记数据下实现鲁棒的语音识别器自适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音识别器通常仅在特定环境下表现最佳，且需要适应新环境。针对新说话人的自适应通常数据不足且未标记，导致传统方法不够鲁棒。

Method: 提出了一种新的损失函数（条件熵）以利用多个假设提高鲁棒性，并引入短向量形式的说话人编码以减少数据需求。

Result: 在噪声增强的Common Voice数据集上，使用1分钟自适应数据时词错误率相对降低20%，10分钟时提升至29%。

Conclusion: 该方法在少量数据下显著提升了语音识别器的自适应能力。

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

*Jie Qin,Wei Yang,Yan Su,Yiran Zhu,Weizhen Li,Yunyue Pan,Chengchang Pan,Honggang Qi*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应双模态框架，通过动态分支选择、双向跨模态GAN和混合训练协议，显著提升了HER2评估的准确性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HER2评估模型通常单独分析H&E或IHC图像，而临床依赖两者的协同解释，但双模态获取常受限于工作流复杂性和成本。

Method: 1) 动态分支选择器；2) 双向跨模态GAN；3) 混合训练协议。

Result: 单模态H&E预测准确率从71.44%提升至94.25%，双模态准确率达95.09%，IHC输入可靠性为90.28%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过弹性设计显著提升了HER2评估的准确性和适用性，尤其在资源有限的环境中具有潜力。

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 研究探讨了情感表达中语音、面部和手势的协调动态，分析了对话结构和同步性对情感清晰度的影响，并基于IEMOCAP语料库进行了多模态情感耦合分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深入了解情感和行为线索在真实互动中的传递机制，提升实时情感检测的准确性。

Method: 使用IEMOCAP语料库中的双人互动数据，结合语音特征（如韵律、MFCCs）和3D面部及手部标记位移，量化表达活跃度，并预测语音到手势的映射。

Result: 非重叠语音引发更高的表达活跃度，尤其是下半脸和嘴部；悲伤在非重叠时表达更强，愤怒在重叠时抑制手势；韵律和MFCCs在发音区域预测准确度最高。

Conclusion: 对话结构和同步性显著影响情感表达的清晰度，多模态协调对情感检测和AI系统设计具有重要意义。

Abstract: Human emotional expression emerges through coordinated vocal, facial, and
gestural signals. While speech face alignment is well established, the broader
dynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand
motion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and
behavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the
coordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn
taking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and
simultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this
alignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances
realtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony
across modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study
examines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from
dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level
prosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions
(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker
displacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise
displacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech
features to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently
elicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness
showed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed
gestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for
prosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower
and more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was
enhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.

Result: 标准RBM在二进制隐藏单元和广泛连接下临界容量降低，改进后的设计恢复了有序检索相，显著提升了检索性能。

Conclusion: 隐藏单元设计对提升RBM的表达能力至关重要，改进后的模型在有限温度下仍能保持高性能。

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of
bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units -
including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections
to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics
of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation
functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis
reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity
suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as
associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such
as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These
adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall
performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported
by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit
design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.
