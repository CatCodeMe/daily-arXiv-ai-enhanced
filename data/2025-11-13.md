### [1] [FlashMap: A Flash Optimized Key-Value Store](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08826)
*Zonglin Guo,Tony Givargis*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: FlashMap是一个针对闪存固态硬盘优化的高性能键值存储系统，在数据中心级服务器上实现了出色的吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着现代计算对响应性和可扩展性的需求增加，键值存储已成为数据基础设施的关键组件。闪存固态硬盘的性能特性为优化键值存储提供了新的机会。

Method: 开发了FlashMap，一个专门针对闪存固态硬盘优化的键值存储系统，充分利用SSD的特性来提升性能。

Result: 实验显示FlashMap在单个数据中心级服务器上实现了卓越的吞吐量：平均每秒1980万次插入和2380万次随机查找（使用100字节负载）。

Conclusion: FlashMap证明了通过针对闪存特性优化键值存储设计，可以在单个服务器上实现极高的性能，满足现代高性能应用的需求。

Abstract: Key-value stores are a fundamental class of NoSQL databases that offer a simple yet powerful model for data storage and retrieval, representing information as pairs of unique keys and associated values. Their minimal structure enables exceptionally fast access times, scalability, and flexibility in storing diverse data types, making them ideal for high-performance applications such as caching, session management, and distributed systems. As modern computing increasingly demands responsiveness and scalability, key-value stores have become a critical component of the data infrastructure in both industry and research contexts. In this work, we present FlashMap, a high-performance key-value store optimized for Flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs). Experiments show that FlashMap achieves outstanding throughput, averaging 19.8 million inserts and 23.8 million random lookups per second with a 100-byte payload, all on a single data center-grade server.

### [2] [Contextual Graph Embeddings: Accounting for Data Characteristics in Heterogeneous Data Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09001)
*Yuka Haruki,Shigeru Ishikura,Kazuya Demachi,Teruaki Hayashi*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合表格结构信息和上下文元素（列描述、外部知识）的图嵌入技术，用于数据集成中的模式匹配和实体解析任务，在多种数据集特性下表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集成方法对数据集特性的影响研究不足，且不同方法的组合有限，需要更有效的自动化解决方案来应对实际企业应用需求。

Method: 采用上下文图嵌入技术，整合表格数据的结构细节以及列描述和外部知识等上下文元素。

Result: 在具有不同特性（领域特异性、数据规模、缺失率、重叠率）的数据集上测试，该方法始终优于现有图基方法，特别是在数值比例高或数据缺失严重等困难场景中。

Conclusion: 上下文嵌入提高了匹配可靠性，数据集特性显著影响集成结果，这些发现有助于开发实用的企业级数据集成系统。

Abstract: As organizations continue to access diverse datasets, the demand for effective data integration has increased. Key tasks in this process, such as schema matching and entity resolution, are essential but often require significant effort. Although previous studies have aimed to automate these tasks, the influence of dataset characteristics on the matching effectiveness has not been thoroughly examined, and combinations of different methods remain limited. This study introduces a contextual graph embedding technique that integrates structural details from tabular data and contextual elements such as column descriptions and external knowledge. Tests conducted on datasets with varying properties such as domain specificity, data size, missing rate, and overlap rate showed that our approach consistently surpassed existing graph-based methods, especially in difficult scenarios such those with a high proportion of numerical values or significant missing data. However, we identified specific failure cases, such as columns that were semantically similar but distinct, which remains a challenge for our method. The study highlights two main insights: (i) contextual embeddings enhance the matching reliability, and (ii) dataset characteristics significantly affect the integration outcomes. These contributions can advance the development of practical data integration systems that can support real-world enterprise applications.

### [3] [Efficient Distributed Exact Subgraph Matching via GNN-PE: Load Balancing, Cache Optimization, and Query Plan Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09052)
*Yu Wang,Hui Wang,Jiake Ge,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了三种核心创新将GNN-PE扩展到分布式系统：轻量级负载均衡机制、多GPU协作缓存策略和查询计划排序方法，显著提升分布式子图匹配的效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN-PE框架在单机上实现高效精确匹配，但缺乏对分布式环境的可扩展性和优化，无法满足大规模图上的精确子图匹配需求。

Method: 1) 轻量级动态相关性感知负载均衡和热迁移机制；2) 基于在线增量学习的多GPU协作动态缓存策略；3) 由支配嵌入剪枝潜力驱动的查询计划排序方法；结合METIS分区、并行离线预处理和轻量级元数据管理。

Result: 在分布式场景（数十台机器）中实现了"最小边割+负载均衡+非中断查询"，显著提高了分布式子图匹配的效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: 通过三项核心创新成功将GNN-PE扩展到分布式系统，解决了大规模图精确子图匹配的挑战，为分布式图计算提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Exact subgraph matching on large-scale graphs remains a challenging problem due to high computational complexity and distributed system constraints. Existing GNN-based path embedding (GNN-PE) frameworks achieve efficient exact matching on single machines but lack scalability and optimization for distributed environments. To address this gap, we propose three core innovations to extend GNN-PE to distributed systems: (1) a lightweight dynamic correlation-aware load balancing and hot migration mechanism that fuses multi-dimensional metrics (CPU, communication, memory) and guarantees index consistency; (2) an online incremental learning-based multi-GPU collaborative dynamic caching strategy with heterogeneous GPU adaptation and graph-structure-aware replacement; (3) a query plan ranking method driven by dominance embedding pruning potential (PE-score) that optimizes execution order. Through METIS partitioning, parallel offline preprocessing, and lightweight metadata management, our approach achieves "minimum edge cut + load balancing + non-interruptible queries" in distributed scenarios (tens of machines), significantly improving the efficiency and stability of distributed subgraph matching.

### [4] [CheetahGIS: Architecting a Scalable and Efficient Streaming Spatial Query Processing System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09262)
*Jiaping Cao,Ting Sun,Man Lung Yiu,Xiao Yan,Bo Tang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: CheetahGIS是一个基于Apache Flink Stateful Functions构建的可扩展高效系统，用于处理海量移动对象上的流式空间查询，通过模块化架构和优化策略实现优秀性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间数据分析系统在处理大量移动对象和实时空间查询时存在局限性，需要构建一个可扩展且高效的系统来应对这些挑战。

Method: 基于Apache Flink Stateful Functions构建，采用模块化架构，设计了轻量级全局网格索引、元数据同步策略和负载均衡机制等优化方案，并制定了通用的空间查询处理范式。

Result: 系统能够处理三种代表性流式查询（对象查询、范围计数查询和k最近邻查询），在真实和合成数据集上的实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: CheetahGIS通过其模块化架构和优化策略，成功解决了处理海量移动对象和实时空间查询的挑战，具有良好的可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Spatial data analytics systems are widely studied in both the academia and industry. However, existing systems are limited when handling a large number of moving objects and real time spatial queries. In this work, we architect a scalable and efficient system CheetahGIS to process streaming spatial queries over massive moving objects. In particular, CheetahGIS is built upon Apache Flink Stateful Functions (StateFun), an API for building distributed streaming applications with an actor-like model. CheetahGIS enjoys excellent scalability due to its modular architecture, which clearly decomposes different components and allows scaling individual components. To improve the efficiency and scalability of CheetahGIS, we devise a suite of optimizations, e.g., lightweight global grid-based index, metadata synchroniza tion strategies, and load balance mechanisms. We also formulate a generic paradigm for spatial query processing in CheetahGIS, and verify its generality by processing three representative streaming queries (i.e., object query, range count query, and k nearest neighbor query). We conduct extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets to evaluate CheetahGIS.

### [5] [An MLIR pipeline for offloading Fortran to FPGAs via OpenMP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08713)
*Gabriel Rodriguez-Canal,David Katz,Nick Brown*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 首次在MLIR中通过OpenMP目标指令实现选择性代码卸载到FPGA，结合OpenMP方言和HLS方言提供可移植的FPGA编译流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着摩尔定律放缓，FPGA等异构计算平台对加速HPC工作负载越来越重要，需要更灵活的编译方法。

Method: 将MLIR OpenMP方言与高级综合(HLS)方言结合，支持任何MLIR兼容前端(如Flang)，利用现有MLIR构建块减少开发工作量。

Result: 实现了基于指令的FPGA加速，支持通过标准OpenMP指令手动优化卸载内核。

Conclusion: 建立了一个灵活可扩展的基于指令的FPGA加速路径，展示了MLIR生态系统的可组合性优势。

Abstract: With the slowing of Moore's Law, heterogeneous computing platforms such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have gained increasing interest for accelerating HPC workloads. In this work we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first implementation of selective code offloading to FPGAs via the OpenMP target directive within MLIR. Our approach combines the MLIR OpenMP dialect with a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) dialect to provide a portable compilation flow targeting FPGAs. Unlike prior OpenMP FPGA efforts that rely on custom compilers, by contrast we integrate with MLIR and so support any MLIR-compatible front end, demonstrated here with Flang. Building upon a range of existing MLIR building blocks significantly reduces the effort required and demonstrates the composability benefits of the MLIR ecosystem. Our approach supports manual optimisation of offloaded kernels through standard OpenMP directives, and this work establishes a flexible and extensible path for directive-based FPGA acceleration integrated within the MLIR ecosystem.

### [6] [No Cords Attached: Coordination-Free Concurrent Lock-Free Queues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09410)
*Yusuf Motiwala*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了Cyclic Memory Protection (CMP)方法，这是一种无协调的队列，在保持严格FIFO语义、无界容量和无锁进度的同时恢复了简单性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无锁队列实现在并发环境下为确保正确性而引入复杂协调机制，这些机制往往掩盖了队列本身的设计，且在AI时代大规模并发场景下保护开销过大。

Method: 使用有界保护窗口的Cyclic Memory Protection (CMP)方法，提供实用的回收保证，避免无限保护带来的复杂性。

Result: CMP在高度竞争环境下比最先进的无锁队列性能提升1.72-4倍，并能扩展到数百个线程。

Conclusion: 高度并发队列可以在不削弱队列语义的情况下回归其基本简单性。

Abstract: The queue is conceptually one of the simplest data structures-a basic FIFO container. However, ensuring correctness in the presence of concurrency makes existing lock-free implementations significantly more complex than their original form. Coordination mechanisms introduced to prevent hazards such as ABA, use-after-free, and unsafe reclamation often dominate the design, overshadowing the queue itself. Many schemes compromise strict FIFO ordering, unbounded capacity, or lock-free progress to mask coordination overheads. Yet the true source of complexity lies in the pursuit of infinite protection against reclamation hazards--theoretically sound but impractical and costly. This pursuit not only drives unnecessary complexity but also creates a protection paradox where excessive protection reduces system resilience rather than improving it. While such costs may be tolerable in conventional workloads, the AI era has shifted the paradigm: training and inference pipelines involve hundreds to thousands of concurrent threads per node, and at this scale, protection and coordination overheads dominate, often far heavier than the basic queue operations themselves.
  This paper introduces Cyclic Memory Protection (CMP), a coordination-free queue that preserves strict FIFO semantics, unbounded capacity, and lock-free progress while restoring simplicity. CMP reclaims the strict FIFO that other approaches sacrificed through bounded protection windows that provide practical reclamation guarantees. We prove strict FIFO and safety via linearizability and bounded reclamation analysis, and show experimentally that CMP outperforms state-of-the-art lock-free queues by up to 1.72-4x under high contention while maintaining scalability to hundreds of threads. Our work demonstrates that highly concurrent queues can return to their fundamental simplicity without weakening queue semantics.

### [7] [Distribution and Management of Datacenter Load Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08936)
*Liuzixuan Lin,Andrew A. Chien*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 数据中心通过能源资源解耦电力容量与电网负载，实现灵活性以降低碳排放。优化分布和管理方法可显著提升电网碳减排效果，经济上可行但需要电网干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI和云数据中心能耗爆炸式增长加剧了碳足迹问题，数据中心恒定电力需求与波动性可再生能源的矛盾需要通过负载适应性来解决。

Method: 定义和计算数据中心负载解耦的功率和能量需求，评估设计的分布和管理方法，包括站点变异性和数据中心-电网合作。

Result: 优化分布可实现98%的潜在电网碳减排，仅需70%的总解耦需求；DC-电网合作（双向共享与控制）比单向信息共享实现1.4倍的碳减排。

Conclusion: 解耦在经济上可行，数据中心可获得超过本地解耦成本的电力成本和碳排放效益，但站点间的差异表明需要电网干预。

Abstract: The exploding power consumption of AI and cloud datacenters (DCs) intensifies the long-standing concerns about their carbon footprint, especially because DCs' need for constant power clashes with volatile renewable generation needed for grid decarbonization. DC flexibility (a.k.a. load adaptation) is a key to reducing DC carbon emissions by improving grid renewable absorption.
  DC flexibility can be created, without disturbing datacenter capacity by decoupling a datacenter's power capacity and grid load with a collection of energy resources. Because decoupling can be costly, we study how to best distribute and manage decoupling to maximize benefits for all. Key considerations include site variation and datacenter-grid cooperation.
  We first define and compute the power and energy needs of datacenter load decoupling, and then we evaluate designed distribution and management approaches. Evaluation shows that optimized distribution can deliver >98% of the potential grid carbon reduction with 70% of the total decoupling need. For management, DC-grid cooperation (2-way sharing and control vs. 1-way info sharing) enables 1.4x grid carbon reduction. Finally, we show that decoupling may be economically viable, as on average datacenters can get power cost and carbon emissions benefits greater than their local costs of decoupling. However, skew across sites suggests grid intervention may be required.

### [8] [Evaluating HPC-Style CPU Performance and Cost in Virtualized Cloud Infrastructures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08948)
*Jay Tharwani,Shobhit Aggarwal,Arnab A Purkayastha*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 评估四大云服务商(AWS、Azure、GCP、OCI)在虚拟化云环境中HPC风格CPU性能和成本的比较研究，使用SPEC ACCEL套件中的OpenMP工作负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究云环境中不同CPU架构(Intel、AMD、ARM)和定价模式(按需付费与一年折扣)对HPC工作负载性能和成本的影响，为云实例选择提供指导。

Method: 使用SPEC ACCEL套件中的OpenMP工作负载，在四大云服务商的Intel、AMD、ARM通用实例类型上进行测试，比较按需付费和一年折扣定价下的性能和成本。

Result: AWS在所有三种实例类型中表现最佳但价格最贵；OCI是最经济的选择但性能较慢；Azure性能和成本居中；GCP在AMD实例上有显著提升但ARM实例性能差且昂贵；AWS的ARM实例比其Intel和AMD实例快达49%。

Conclusion: 实例选择和云服务商选择对运行时间和成本有显著影响，应根据工作负载优先级(原始速度或成本最小化)来指导实例类型决策。

Abstract: This paper evaluates HPC-style CPU performance and cost in virtualized cloud infrastructures using a subset of OpenMP workloads in the SPEC ACCEL suite. Four major cloud providers by market share AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) are compared across Intel, AMD, and ARM general purpose instance types under both on-demand and one-year discounted pricing. AWS consistently delivers the shortest runtime in all three instance types, yet charges a premium, especially for on-demand usage. OCI emerges as the most economical option across all CPU families, although it generally runs workloads more slowly than AWS. Azure often exhibits mid-range performance and cost, while GCP presents a mixed profile: it sees a notable boost when moving from Intel to AMD. On the other hand, its ARM instance is more than twice as slow as its own AMD offering and remains significantly more expensive. AWS's internal comparisons reveal that its ARM instance can outperform its Intel and AMD siblings by up to 49 percent in runtime. These findings highlight how instance choices and provider selection can yield substantial variations in both runtime and price, indicating that workload priorities, whether raw speed or cost minimization, should guide decisions on instance types.

*Zilinghan Li,Aditya Sinha,Yijiang Li,Kyle Chard,Kibaek Kim,Ravi Madduri*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了企业级隐私保护联邦学习框架APPFL，旨在解决从本地原型到分布式部署的扩展性问题，支持跨异构计算环境的无缝部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习在企业级应用中面临的挑战，包括数据隐私保护、跨异构基础设施的可扩展部署，以及从研究原型到实际部署的过渡问题。

Method: 基于APPFL框架经验，提出包含五个关键能力的架构设计：可扩展本地仿真、无缝部署过渡、跨基础设施分布式部署、多层次抽象、以及包含差分隐私和安全聚合的全面隐私保护。

Result: 提出了一个企业级隐私保护联邦学习框架的设计愿景，能够支持从个人设备到云集群和HPC系统的跨环境部署。

Conclusion: 该框架旨在弥合研究原型与企业级部署之间的差距，为科学应用提供可扩展、可靠且隐私保护的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enabling collaborative model training without centralized data sharing, a crucial requirement in scientific domains where data privacy, ownership, and compliance constraints are critical. However, building user-friendly enterprise-level FL frameworks that are both scalable and privacy-preserving remains challenging, especially when bridging the gap between local prototyping and distributed deployment across heterogeneous client computing infrastructures. In this paper, based on our experiences building the Advanced Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (APPFL) framework, we present our vision for an enterprise-grade, privacy-preserving FL framework designed to scale seamlessly across computing environments. We identify several key capabilities that such a framework must provide: (1) Scalable local simulation and prototyping to accelerate experimentation and algorithm design; (2) seamless transition from simulation to deployment; (3) distributed deployment across diverse, real-world infrastructures, from personal devices to cloud clusters and HPC systems; (4) multi-level abstractions that balance ease of use and research flexibility; and (5) comprehensive privacy and security through techniques such as differential privacy, secure aggregation, robust authentication, and confidential computing. We further discuss architectural designs to realize these goals. This framework aims to bridge the gap between research prototypes and enterprise-scale deployment, enabling scalable, reliable, and privacy-preserving AI for science.

### [10] [Flex-MIG: Enabling Distributed Execution on MIG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09143)
*Myungsu Kim,Ikjun Yeom,Younghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Flex-MIG是一个软件框架，通过将MIG从一对一分配模型改为一对多分配模型，并支持跨MIG实例的主机共享内存集合操作，解决了GPU集群中的碎片化和利用率低下问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多租户环境下的GPU集群经常存在利用率低下的问题，而NVIDIA MIG虽然提供硬件级隔离，但其硬件刚性和传统的一对一分配模型会导致严重的碎片化和集群范围的利用率低下。

Method: Flex-MIG采用纯软件方法，将MIG从一对一分配模型改为一对多分配模型，并实现跨MIG实例的主机共享内存集合操作，无需硬件修改。

Result: Flex-MIG消除了需要排空的重配置需求，减少了碎片化，在不同跟踪数据下将makespan提高了高达17%。

Conclusion: 将MIG的操作模型重新设计为软件协调层可以显著提高集群效率。

Abstract: GPU clusters in multi-tenant settings often suffer from underutilization, making GPU-sharing technologies essential for efficient resource use. Among them, NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) has gained traction for providing hardware-level isolation that enables concurrent workloads without interference. However, MIG's hardware rigidity and the conventional one-to-one allocation model jointly lead to severe fragmentation and cluster-wide underutilization. We present Flex-MIG, a software-only framework that replaces one-to-one with a one-to-many allocation model and enables host-shared-memory collectives across MIG instances without hardware modification. Flex-MIG eliminates drain-required reconfiguration, reduces fragmentation, and improves makespan by up to 17% across diverse traces, showing that rethinking MIG's operational model as a software-coordinated layer substantially improves cluster efficiency.

### [11] [Minimize Your Critical Path with Combine-and-Exchange Locks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09194)
*Simon König,Lukas Epple,Christian Becker*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的用户空间调度方法Combine-and-Exchange Scheduling (CES)，用于优化协程等用户空间任务的同步性能，相比现有方法能带来3-8倍的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代编程语言广泛支持协程用于高并行或异步应用，用户空间同步避免了重量级系统调用。但现有用户空间同步原语仍采用内核级调度视角，导致关键路径上不必要的延迟，限制了吞吐量。

Method: 开发了Combine-and-Exchange Scheduling (CES)调度方法，确保竞争临界区保持在同一执行线程上，同时将可并行工作均匀分布在剩余线程上。

Result: 该方法可应用于多种现有语言和库，在应用基准测试中实现3倍性能提升，在微基准测试中实现8倍性能提升。

Conclusion: CES方法重新思考了用户空间任务的同步机制，通过创新的调度策略显著提升了协程等用户空间任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Coroutines are experiencing a renaissance as many modern programming languages support the use of cooperative multitasking for highly parallel or asynchronous applications. One of the greatest advantages of this is that concurrency and synchronization is manged entirely in the userspace, omitting heavy-weight system calls. However, we find that state-of-the-art userspace synchronization primitives approach synchronization in the userspace from the perspective of kernel-level scheduling. This introduces unnecessary delays on the critical path of the application, limiting throughput. In this paper, we re-think synchronization for tasks that are scheduled entirely in the userspace (e.g., coroutines, fibers, etc.). We develop Combine-and-Exchange Scheduling (CES), a novel scheduling approach that ensures contended critical sections stay on the same thread of execution while parallelizable work is evenly spread across the remaining threads. We show that our approach can be applied to many existing languages and libraries, resulting in 3-fold performance improvements in application benchmarks as well as 8-fold performance improvements in microbenchmarks.

### [12] [SPADA: A Spatial Dataflow Architecture Programming Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09447)
*Lukas Gianinazzi,Tal Ben-Nun,Torsten Hoefler*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SPADA是一种针对空间数据流架构的编程语言，通过抽象底层架构细节，提供对数据放置、数据流模式和异步操作的精确控制，显著简化了Cerebras等架构的编程复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FPGA和CGRA编程模型主要关注循环调度，但忽视了空间数据流架构的独特能力，特别是高效的数据流处理和复杂路由管理，导致编程这些高性能架构仍然困难。

Method: 设计了SPADA编程语言，提供严格的数据流语义框架，定义路由正确性、数据竞争和死锁；开发了针对Cerebras CSL的多级编译器；作为高级编程接口和DSL中间表示。

Result: SPADA使开发者能够用比CSL少6-8倍的代码表达复杂并行模式，在三个数量级上实现接近理想的弱扩展性能；成功应用于GT4Py模板DSL。

Conclusion: SPADA通过统一的空间数据流架构编程模型，推进了这些新兴高性能计算平台的理论基础和实践可用性。

Abstract: Spatial dataflow architectures like the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine achieve exceptional performance in AI and scientific applications by leveraging distributed memory across processing elements (PEs) and localized computation. However, programming these architectures remains challenging due to the need for explicit orchestration of data movement through reconfigurable networks-on-chip and asynchronous computation triggered by data arrival. Existing FPGA and CGRA programming models emphasize loop scheduling but overlook the unique capabilities of spatial dataflow architectures, particularly efficient dataflow over regular grids and intricate routing management.
  We present SPADA, a programming language that provides precise control over data placement, dataflow patterns, and asynchronous operations while abstracting architecture-specific low-level details. We introduce a rigorous dataflow semantics framework for SPADA that defines routing correctness, data races, and deadlocks. Additionally, we design and implement a compiler targeting Cerebras CSL with multi-level lowering.
  SPADA serves as both a high-level programming interface and an intermediate representation for domain-specific languages (DSLs), which we demonstrate with the GT4Py stencil DSL. SPADA enables developers to express complex parallel patterns -- including pipelined reductions and multi-dimensional stencils -- in 6--8x less code than CSL with near-ideal weak scaling across three orders of magnitude. By unifying programming for spatial dataflow architectures under a single model, SPADA advances both the theoretical foundations and practical usability of these emerging high-performance computing platforms.

TL;DR: 使用CSP过程代数对Python联邦学习测试床中的第三个通用算法（TDM通信）进行形式化验证，通过两阶段方法证明其死锁自由性和成功终止性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在前一篇论文中已经对前两个联邦学习算法进行了形式化验证，本文旨在对第三个通用算法（TDM通信）进行同样的形式化验证，确保其正确性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段构建忠实反映真实Python代码的CSP模型；第二阶段使用模型检查器PAT自动验证算法的死锁自由性（安全属性）和成功终止性（活性属性）。

Result: 模型检查器PAT成功证明了第三个通用算法的正确性，包括死锁自由和成功终止两个关键属性。

Conclusion: 通过形式化验证方法，证明了Python联邦学习测试床中TDM通信算法的正确性，为边缘系统中的联邦学习算法提供了可靠的理论保障。

Abstract: The Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms is a simple FL framework targeting edge systems, which provides the three generic algorithms: the centralized federated learning, the decentralized federated learning, and the universal TDM communication in the current time slot. The first two were formally verified in a previous paper using the CSP process algebra, and in this paper, we use the same approach to formally verify the third one, in two phases. In the first phase, we construct the CSP model as a faithful representation of the real Python code. In the second phase, the model checker PAT automatically proves correctness of the third generic algorithm by proving its deadlock freeness (safety property) and successful termination (liveness property).

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, distributed inference has become increasingly important. Model-parallel strategies must now efficiently scale not only across multiple GPUs but also across multiple nodes. In this work, we present a detailed performance study of multi-node distributed inference using LLMs on GPU-based supercomputers. We conduct experiments with several state-of-the-art inference engines alongside YALIS, a research-oriented prototype engine designed for controlled experimentation. We analyze the strong-scaling behavior of different model-parallel schemes and identify key bottlenecks. Since all-reduce operations are a common performance bottleneck, we develop NVRAR, a hierarchical all-reduce algorithm based on recursive doubling with NVSHMEM. NVRAR achieves up to 1.9x-3.6x lower latency than NCCL for message sizes between 128 KB and 2 MB on HPE Slingshot and InfiniBand interconnects. Integrated into YALIS, NVRAR achieves up to a 1.72x reduction in end-to-end batch latency for the Llama 3.1 405B model in multi-node decode-heavy workloads using tensor parallelism.

### [16] [Space-Efficient and Output-Sensitive Algorithms for the Longest Common Bitonic Subsequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08958)
*Md. Tanzeem Rahat,Md. Manzurul Hasan*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了两种改进的最长公共双调子序列算法：一种使用θ(min(n,m))空间的滚动行实现，另一种基于稀疏DAG的O((n+m)logn + MlogM)时间算法，显著优于传统的θ(nm)时间空间方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LCBS在生物信息学、金融和信号分析中自然建模上升-下降模式，但现有方法需要θ(nm)时间和空间，限制了实际应用。

Method: 1. 改进的滚动行实现：在θ(nm)时间内仅使用θ(min(n,m))额外内存；2. 稀疏DAG方法：将问题转化为稀疏图中的最长路径问题，利用M个符号匹配和C个双调兼容对。

Result: 新算法在M << nm时渐进更快，使精确LCBS计算对之前无法处理的输入变得可行。

Conclusion: 突破了LCBS的空间障碍，揭示了新的细粒度复杂度格局，为实际应用打开了可能性。

Abstract: The longest common bitonic subsequence (LCBS) of two sequences A and B is the longest subsequence that increases to a single peak and then decreases while appearing, in order, in both inputs. Although LCBS naturally models rise-fall patterns in bioinformatics, finance, and signal analysis, the only previously documented solution was a quadratic dynamic program that needs θ(nm) time and space. We show that this space barrier is not inherent: a refined rolling-row implementation evaluates the same recurrence in θ(nm) time with only θ(min(n, m)) additional memory. By isolating the M symbol matches and their C bitonic-compatible pairs, we cast LCBS as a longest-path problem in a sparse DAG and solve it in O((n + m) log n + M log M) time and O(M) space, which is asymptotically faster than the quadratic baseline whenever M << n m. These results make exact LCBS computation practical for inputs that were previously out of reach and expose a new fine-grained complexity landscape that invites further exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线算法对输入分布错误设定的鲁棒性，探索能否设计一个停止规则同时适用于先知不等式和秘书问题，即在已知分布和未知分布情况下都能获得良好的竞争比。

Method: 引入了一系列算法族，在极端的i.i.d.先知问题和秘书问题上达到最优，并证明了某些(α, β)组合无法被任何自适应停止规则实现。研究在固定n个到达和泊松过程到达两种设置下进行。

Result: 获得了非平凡的同时近似保证，确定了可达到和不可达到的(α, β)帕累托边界，提供了泊松设置和固定到达设置之间的归约方法。

Conclusion: 证明了在先知不等式和秘书问题之间存在同时近似权衡，建立了两种设置下竞争比的帕累托边界，为分布错误设定下的鲁棒算法设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Many online problems are studied in stochastic settings for which inputs are samples from a known distribution, given in advance, or from an unknown distribution. Such distributions model both beyond-worst-case inputs and, when given, partial foreknowledge for the online algorithm. But how robust can such algorithms be to misspecification of the given distribution? When is this detectable, and when does it matter? When can algorithms give good competitive ratios both when the input distribution is as specified, and when it is not?
  We consider these questions in the setting of optimal stopping, where the cases of known and unknown distributions correspond to the well-known prophet inequality and to the secretary problem, respectively. Here we ask: Can a stopping rule be competitive for the i.i.d. prophet inequality problem and the secretary problem at the same time? We constrain the Pareto frontier of simultaneous approximation ratios $(α, β)$ that a stopping rule can attain.
  We introduce a family of algorithms that give nontrivial joint guarantees and are optimal for the extremal i.i.d. prophet and secretary problems. We also prove impossibilities, identifying $(α, β)$ unattainable by any adaptive stopping rule. Our results hold for both $n$ fixed arrivals and for arrivals from a Poisson process with rate $n$. We work primarily in the Poisson setting, and provide reductions between the Poisson and $n$-arrival settings that may be of broader interest.

Abstract: As modern software systems continue to grow in complexity, triage has become a fundamental process in system operations and maintenance. Triage aims to efficiently prioritize, assign, and assess issues to ensure the reliability of complex environments. The vast amount of heterogeneous data generated by software systems has made effective triage indispensable for maintaining reliability, facilitating maintainability, and enabling rapid issue response. Motivated by these challenges, researchers have devoted extensive effort to advancing triage automation and have achieved significant progress over the past two decades. This survey provides a comprehensive review of 234 papers from 2004 to the present, offering an in-depth examination of the fundamental concepts, system architecture, and problem statement. By comparing the distinct goals of academic and industrial research and by analyzing empirical studies of industrial practices, we identify the major obstacles that limit the practical deployment of triage systems. To assist practitioners in method selection and performance evaluation, we summarize widely adopted open-source datasets and evaluation metrics, providing a unified perspective on the measurement of triage effectiveness. Finally, we outline potential future directions and emerging opportunities to foster a closer integration between academic innovation and industrial application. All reviewed papers and projects are available at https://github.com/AIOps-Lab-NKU/TriageSurvey.

*Jarin Tasnim,Debasish Chakroborti,Chanchal K. Roy,Kevin A. Schneider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究分析了87个仓库中105,396个回移植提交的技术债务问题，发现约4.3%的回移植会引入新的技术债务，不同生态系统和开发阶段存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究回移植过程中技术债务的产生机制，识别何时以及为何在稳定源代码的回移植过程中会产生新的技术债务。

Method: 分析31,076个回移植源中的105,396个提交，覆盖Apache、Eclipse和Python三个软件生态系统的87个仓库。

Result: Apache贡献了最多的绝对技术债务实例，而Python和Eclipse的债务与提交比率几乎是Apache的三倍；不同生态系统在不同发布周期阶段积累技术债务的模式不同；经验不足、工作负荷高或非所有者的开发者更容易在回移植中引入技术债务。

Conclusion: 回移植过程确实会引入技术债务，且其分布受到生态系统类型、发布周期阶段和开发者特征的影响，需要针对性地改进回移植实践以减少技术债务。

Abstract: Maintaining software is an ongoing process that stretches beyond the initial release. Stable software versions continuously evolve to fix bugs, add improvements, address security issues, and ensure compatibility. This ongoing support involves Backporting, which means taking a fix or update from a newer version and applying it to an older version of the same software. As software versions evolve, new technical debt can arise during backport maintenance activities. This study examines the technical debt involved in fixing 105,396 commits from 31,076 backport sources across 87 repositories in three software ecosystems (Apache, Eclipse, and Python). The goal is to identify when and why new technical debt arises during backporting in stable source code. Our results indicate that approximately 4.3% of backports introduce new technical debt. Apache contributes the most absolute instances, while Python and Eclipse exhibit nearly three times higher debt-to-commit ratios than Apache. Feature migrations make older Apache releases debt-prone in the early phase, whereas Python and Eclipse releases tend to accumulate technical debt mostly during the middle phase of their release cycles. Additionally, developers who are inexperienced, under high workloads, or non-owners are more likely to introduce technical debt during backporting.

TL;DR: 提出自动化测试计划生成方法，以减少生产环境中测试活动可能引起的服务中断


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计测试计划繁琐且容易出错，特别是在大型复杂系统中更加困难。生产环境中的测试需要在不干扰生产流量的情况下进行，因此需要妥善编排测试活动以避免干扰。

Method: 提出自动化测试计划生成方法，包括测试配置选择/生成、测试配置部署规划、创建测试运行计划、选择降低干扰风险的策略等任务。通过案例研究说明该方法。

Result: 该方法能够自动化生成测试计划，减少生产环境中测试活动可能引起的服务中断。

Conclusion: 自动化测试计划生成方法能够有效解决手动设计测试计划的困难，降低生产环境中测试活动对服务的干扰风险。

Abstract: Live testing is performed in the production environment ideally without causing unacceptable disturbance to the production traffic. Thus, test activities have to be orchestrated properly to avoid interferences with the production traffic. A test plan is the road map that specifies how the test activities need to be orchestrated. Developing a test plan includes tasks such as test configuration selection/generation, test configuration deployment planning, creating the test runs schedule, choosing strategies to mitigate the risk of interferences, etc. The manual design of a test plan is tedious and error prone. This task becomes harder especially when the systems are large and complex. In this paper we propose an approach for automating test plans generation. With this approach we aim at reducing service disruption that may be induced by the testing activities in production. We illustrate our approach with a case study and discuss its different aspects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业PLC编程中专用代码方言的挑战，以及企业对云服务的不信任问题，需要开发本地化的编码助手。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)技术，结合多模型竞争机制、推理能力和自动错误修正，通过即时编译验证代码有效性。

Result: 实现了在低数据领域的高质量代码生成，支持边缘设备使用的小模型微调，并通过编译统计和用户评分验证效果。

Conclusion: RAG支持的编码助手结合精心设计的提示工程和定向检索，可以在低数据工业领域有效工作，无需依赖大模型微调。

Abstract: Programmable Logic Controllers are operated by proprietary code dialects; this makes it challenging to train coding assistants. Current LLMs are trained on large code datasets and are capable of writing IEC 61131-3 compatible code out of the box, but they neither know specific function blocks, nor related project code. Moreover, companies like Mitsubishi Electric and their customers do not trust cloud providers. Hence, an own coding agent is the desired solution to cope with this. In this study, we present our work on a low-data domain coding assistant solution for industrial use. We show how we achieved high quality code generation without fine-tuning large models and by fine-tuning small local models for edge device usage. Our tool lets several AI models compete with each other, uses reasoning, corrects bugs automatically and checks code validity by compiling it directly in the chat interface. We support our approach with an extensive evaluation that comes with code compilation statistics and user ratings. We found that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) supported coding assistant can work in low-data domains by using extensive prompt engineering and directed retrieval.

TL;DR: SPLVD是一种基于自步学习的软件漏洞检测方法，通过动态选择训练数据模拟人类从易到难的学习过程，在标准数据集和新生态系统中均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习漏洞检测方法准确率有限，主要原因是训练数据质量低。需要改进训练数据选择策略来提高检测性能。

Method: 提出SPLVD方法，包含专门为漏洞检测设计的数据选择器，能在每个训练周期前重新计算源代码难度，选择新的训练数据并更新选择器，实现从易到难的学习过程。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（包含239K+源代码，其中25K有漏洞）上，SPLVD分别达到89.2%、68.7%和43.5%的最高F1分数。在OpenHarmony新生态系统上达到90.9%的最高精确率。

Conclusion: SPLVD通过自步学习策略有效提高了软件漏洞检测的准确性，在标准数据集和新生态系统中均表现出优越性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities are major risks to software systems. Recently, researchers have proposed many deep learning approaches to detect software vulnerabilities. However, their accuracy is limited in practice. One of the main causes is low-quality training data (i.e., source code). To this end, we propose a new approach: SPLVD (Self-Paced Learning for Software Vulnerability Detection). SPLVD dynamically selects source code for model training based on the stage of training, which simulates the human learning process progressing from easy to hard. SPLVD has a data selector that is specifically designed for the vulnerability detection task, which enables it to prioritize the learning of easy source code. Before each training epoch, SPLVD uses the data selector to recalculate the difficulty of the source code, select new training source code, and update the data selector. When evaluating SPLVD, we first use three benchmark datasets with over 239K source code in which 25K are vulnerable for standard evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that SPLVD achieves the highest F1 of 89.2%, 68.7%, and 43.5%, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. Then we collect projects from OpenHarmony, a new ecosystem that has not been learned by general LLMs, to evaluate SPLVD further. SPLVD achieves the highest precision of 90.9%, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: AILINKPREVIEWER是一个利用大语言模型生成PR中链接预览的工具，通过分析PR元数据来提供更丰富的上下文信息，提升代码审查效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码审查中链接到问题和外部资源的引用通常被自动化任务忽略，这限制了信息的丰富性并增加了认知负担。

Method: 使用大语言模型基于PR元数据（标题、描述、评论和链接内容）生成链接预览，比较了三种方法：上下文LLM摘要、非上下文LLM摘要和基于元数据的预览。

Result: 上下文摘要在BLEU、BERTScore和压缩比等指标上表现更好，但用户研究显示大多数参与者更喜欢非上下文摘要，表明指标性能与感知可用性之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的链接预览有潜力提升代码审查效率，为开发者和软件工程自动化提供更丰富的上下文。

Abstract: Code review is a key practice in software engineering, where developers evaluate code changes to ensure quality and maintainability. Links to issues and external resources are often included in Pull Requests (PRs) to provide additional context, yet they are typically discarded in automated tasks such as PR summarization and code review comment generation. This limits the richness of information available to reviewers and increases cognitive load by forcing context-switching. To address this gap, we present AILINKPREVIEWER, a tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate previews of links in PRs using PR metadata, including titles, descriptions, comments, and link body content. We analyzed 50 engineered GitHub repositories and compared three approaches: Contextual LLM summaries, Non-Contextual LLM summaries, and Metadata-based previews. The results in metrics such as BLEU, BERTScore, and compression ratio show that contextual summaries consistently outperform other methods. However, in a user study with seven participants, most preferred non-contextual summaries, suggesting a trade-off between metric performance and perceived usability. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-powered link previews to enhance code review efficiency and to provide richer context for developers and automation in software engineering.

Motivation: 手动创建用例模型耗时费力，实践中常被跳过，需要自动化方法来提高效率。

Method: 集成开源权重LLM，通过高级提示工程技术从软件需求中系统提取参与者和用例。

Result: 与五位专业软件工程师的探索性研究表明，建模时间减少60%，模型质量与传统方法相当，并为过程提供有价值的指导。

Conclusion: LLM辅助方法能显著加速用例建模过程，同时保持质量，为软件开发实践提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Use case modeling employs user-centered scenarios to outline system requirements. These help to achieve consensus among relevant stakeholders. Because the manual creation of use case models is demanding and time-consuming, it is often skipped in practice. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in this tedious process. The proposed method integrates an open-weight LLM to systematically extract actors and use cases from software requirements with advanced prompt engineering techniques. The method is evaluated using an exploratory study conducted with five professional software engineers, which compares traditional manual modeling to the proposed LLM-based approach. The results show a substantial acceleration, reducing the modeling time by 60\%. At the same time, the model quality remains on par. Besides improving the modeling efficiency, the participants indicated that the method provided valuable guidance in the process.

Method: 收集并分析328个来自公开Claude Code项目的配置文件，识别其中指定的软件工程关注点和实践，以及这些关注点在单个文件中的共现模式

Result: 研究结果强调了在智能代理配置文件中定义广泛关注点和实践的重要性，特别是明确指定代理应遵循的架构

Conclusion: 智能代码助手的行为和效果高度依赖于配置文件，这些文件需要涵盖广泛的软件工程关注点，其中架构规范尤为重要

Abstract: Agentic code assistants are a new generation of AI systems capable of performing end-to-end software engineering tasks. While these systems promise unprecedented productivity gains, their behavior and effectiveness depend heavily on configuration files that define architectural constraints, coding practices, and tool usage policies. However, little is known about the structure and content of these configuration artifacts. This paper presents an empirical study of the configuration ecosystem of Claude Code, one of the most widely used agentic coding systems. We collected and analyzed 328 configuration files from public Claude Code projects to identify (i) the software engineering concerns and practices they specify and (ii) how these concerns co-occur within individual files. The results highlight the importance of defining a wide range of concerns and practices in agent configuration files, with particular emphasis on specifying the architecture the agent should follow.

TL;DR: Routesplain是首个针对软件相关任务的LLM路由系统，通过提取可解释的概念特征进行路由决策，在准确性和成本方面优于单个模型，并达到或超过所有黑盒基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在软件相关任务中表现差异显著，通过路由用户查询到合适的LLM可以提高响应质量并降低成本。现有工作主要关注通用LLM路由，缺乏专门针对软件任务的路由器。

Method: Routesplain首先从每个查询中提取人类可解释的概念（如任务类型、领域、推理复杂度），然后基于这些概念进行路由决策，提供可理解且可信的推理过程。

Result: 在16个最先进LLM和8个软件相关任务上的评估显示，Routesplain在准确性和成本方面均优于单个模型，且等于或超过所有黑盒基线方法。

Conclusion: Routesplain证明了基于概念的路由方法在软件任务中的有效性，概念级干预为进一步改进路由器提供了途径。

Abstract: LLMs now tackle a wide range of software-related tasks, yet we show that their performance varies markedly both across and within these tasks. Routing user queries to the appropriate LLMs can therefore help improve response quality while reducing cost. Prior work, however, has focused mainly on general-purpose LLM routing via black-box models. We introduce Routesplain, the first LLM router for software-related tasks, including multilingual code generation and repair, input/output prediction, and computer science QA. Unlike existing routing approaches, Routesplain first extracts human-interpretable concepts from each query (e.g., task, domain, reasoning complexity) and only routes based on these concepts, thereby providing intelligible, faithful rationales. We evaluate Routesplain on 16 state-of-the-art LLMs across eight software-related tasks; Routesplain outperforms individual models both in terms of accuracy and cost, and equals or surpasses all black-box baselines, with concept-level intervention highlighting avenues for further router improvements.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于测量的框架，用于预测5G非独立组网铁路环境中的早期无线链路故障，比较了六种模型在不同观察窗口和预测时间下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在5G铁路环境中，需要提前预测无线链路故障以采取主动措施（如冗余和自适应切换），提高系统可靠性。

Method: 使用10Hz地铁列车轨迹数据，包含服务小区和邻区指标，对CNN、LSTM、XGBoost、Anomaly Transformer、PatchTST和TimesNet六种模型进行基准测试，评估不同观察窗口和预测时间下的性能。

Result: 当观察窗口为3秒时，TimesNet在3秒预测时间下获得最高F1分数，CNN在2秒预测时间下提供良好的准确性和延迟权衡。

Conclusion: 深度时序模型可以使用商用设备上的轻量级特征提前几秒预测可靠性下降，为5G铁路系统提供实用的早期预警控制路径。

Abstract: In this paper, a measurement-driven framework is proposed for early radio link failure (RLF) prediction in 5G non-standalone (NSA) railway environments. Using 10 Hz metro-train traces with serving and neighbor-cell indicators, we benchmark six models, namely CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, Anomaly Transformer, PatchTST, and TimesNet, under varied observation windows and prediction horizons. When the observation window is three seconds, TimesNet attains the highest F1 score with a three-second prediction horizon, while CNN provides a favorable accuracy-latency tradeoff with a two-second horizon, enabling proactive actions such as redundancy and adaptive handovers. The results indicate that deep temporal models can anticipate reliability degradations several seconds in advance using lightweight features available on commercial devices, offering a practical path to early-warning control in 5G-based railway systems.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效实现边缘域的网络透明数据包处理，支持智能社区的多样化服务需求，同时保持TCP会话完整性并最小化网络延迟影响。

Abstract: This study aims to realize a mechanism for packet processing in the edge domain while maintaining network transparency, in order to accommodate diverse service requirements in smart communities. Since conventional flow control, which operates on a per-packet basis, lacks flexibility, we propose a content-based fine-grained flow management method that enables control at the level of individual content segments within packets. In addition, we introduce an out-of-path transparent add-on architecture to address the limitations of conventional transparent add-ons, which assume the presence of processing resources on the main path. The proposed system implements one approach for selective content masking and two approaches for out-of-path anonymization. Furthermore, we develop a mechanism for dynamically rewriting Ack and Seq numbers to preserve TCP session integrity. The proposed approaches were implemented and evaluated on Mininet, and the results demonstrate that effective flow management can be achieved with minimal impact on network delay while maintaining network transparency.

Abstract: The trade-off between energy and latency budgets is becoming significant due to the more stringent QoS requirements in 6G vehicular networks. However, comprehensively studying the trade-off between energy and latency budgets for 6G vehicular network with new Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) features is still under-explored. This paper proposes a novel multi-hop, multi-path vehicular networking that jointly optimizes vehicular traffic splitting across candidate routes and per-link transmit power to achieve low-latency and low-power communications. Afterwards, we formalize two complementary problem formulations (minimum latency and minimum power) based on the proposed 6G V2X architecture and provide sufficient conditions. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated via well-designed simulations. Based on these theories, we design algorithm (LLP MHMP Scheduler) that switches on demand between a fixed-power minimum-latency mode and a fixed-latency minimum-power mode.

It highlights the key steps that connect personal vision, structured experimentation, and lasting value creation, and shows how AI agents can act as digital co-founders throughout this journey. Building on research in entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation, we present a framework with three key stages: (1) Imagination shaping, where vague goals become clear value propositions, supported by AI agents that help with market scanning, idea refinement, and rapid concept generation; (2) Reality testing, where these ideas are tested through low-cost experiments, structured feedback loops, and efficient execution, with AI agents automating tasks such as prototyping, content creation, customer interaction, and data analysis; and (3) Reality scaling, where successful ideas are transformed into repeatable processes, scalable market strategies, and long-term business models, increasingly operated and optimized by autonomous or semi-autonomous AI workflows. We focus on the specific context of solopreneurship, characterized by limited human resources, complete accountability for decision-making, and a strong association between the founder's identity and the business. The framework clearly identifies key enabling factors such as mental adaptability, effective planning, and successful human-AI collaboration within digital ecosystems. It also thoughtfully addresses ongoing challenges, like uncertainty and cognitive overload, which are heightened by our constant connectivity.

*Kaleem Ullah Qasim,Jiashu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGAR是一种新的训练方法，通过将课程学习应用于架构深度而非传统数据排序，显著提升递归推理模型的训练效率。该方法包含渐进深度课程和分层监督加权两个组件，在Sudoku-Extreme数据集上实现1.71倍训练加速和42%成本降低，同时保持高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归推理模型虽然性能优异，但训练计算成本高昂（约36 GPU小时/数据集），限制了其广泛应用和研究。需要开发更高效的训练方法来降低计算成本。

Method: CGAR包含两个核心组件：1）渐进深度课程：在训练过程中动态调整递归深度，从浅到深配置；2）分层监督加权：对监督步骤应用指数衰减的重要性权重，使损失权重与观察到的梯度幅度衰减对齐。

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme数据集上，CGAR实现1.71倍训练加速（10.93到6.38小时，42%成本降低），仅损失0.63%准确率（86.65%到86.02%）。渐进深度课程单独实现2.26倍加速和85.47%准确率。

Conclusion: CGAR证明了在架构深度上应用原则性课程学习能够有效训练递归推理模型，在适度硬件上实现训练效率和解决方案质量的双重提升，同时提供更好的推理效率。

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

TL;DR: 本文提出PhyKAN方法，将传统的矩量法(MoM)中的静态RWG基函数推广为可学习的自适应基函数，通过物理信息Kolmogorov-Arnold网络实现电磁建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统矩量法受限于静态几何定义的基函数，如RWG基函数，限制了建模的灵活性和适应性。

Method: 提出PhyKAN方法，将RWG基函数推广为可学习的自适应基函数，结合局部KAN分支和嵌入格林函数先验的全局分支，保持物理一致性。

Result: 在典型几何结构上，PhyKAN实现了低于0.01的重构误差，并能准确进行无监督雷达截面预测。

Conclusion: PhyKAN在经典求解器和现代神经网络模型之间建立了可解释、物理一致的桥梁，为电磁建模提供了新方法。

Abstract: The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.

Abstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.

Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算成本高，现有数据驱动方法存在误差累积和物理一致性不足的问题，特别是在多物理场和复杂几何中。

Method: 通过PDE引导的消息传递重新设计图神经网络架构，将关键PDE动态（如对流、粘性、扩散）嵌入到不同的消息函数中，采用分层架构捕捉多尺度特征，并在损失函数中集成物理正则化。

Conclusion: PEGNet通过物理嵌入的图网络架构，有效解决了数据驱动方法在复杂物理模拟中的误差累积和物理不一致问题，为科学和工程应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulations of physical phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are important for scientific and engineering progress. While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods.

*David Sanchez,Holly Lopez,Michelle Buraczyk,Anantaa Kotal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAIRPLAI是一个将人类监督集成到机器学习系统设计和部署中的实用框架，通过隐私-公平边界、交互式利益相关者输入和差分隐私审计循环，在保持强隐私保护的同时减少公平性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在医疗、金融、招聘等关键领域的应用，仅关注准确性已不足够，模型还需要保证对不同群体的公平性、保护个人隐私并保持对利益相关者的问责。然而，同时实现这三个目标很困难：差分隐私可能无意中加剧差异，公平性干预通常依赖敏感数据，而自动化流程忽视了公平性最终是人类的上下文判断。

Method: FAIRPLAI框架通过三种方式工作：(1)构建隐私-公平边界，使准确性、隐私保证和群体结果之间的权衡透明化；(2)支持交互式利益相关者输入，允许决策者选择反映其领域需求的公平标准和操作点；(3)嵌入差分隐私审计循环，让人类能够审查解释和边缘案例而不损害个人数据安全。

Result: 在基准数据集上的应用表明，FAIRPLAI在保持强隐私保护的同时，相对于自动化基线持续减少了公平性差异。更重要的是，它为从业者提供了一个简单、可解释的过程来管理准确性、隐私和公平性在具有社会影响力应用中的竞争需求。

Conclusion: 通过在最重要的地方嵌入人类判断，FAIRPLAI为在实践中有效、负责任和可信赖的机器学习系统提供了一条路径。

Abstract: As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了系统提示对LLM智能体行为的影响，且结果对提示的微小变化很敏感，需要建立更稳健的行为研究基线。

Method: 提出LLM-ABS框架，通过(i)探索不同系统提示的影响，(ii)使用中性提示变体获得更可靠的偏好洞察，(iii)分析语言特征来理解行为背后的推理。

Result: 智能体通常表现出强烈的公平偏好，系统提示对其行为有显著影响，不同模型以不同方式表达响应。

Conclusion: 虽然提示敏感性仍是挑战，但LLM-ABS框架为LLM智能体行为研究提供了稳健的基础。

Abstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

Motivation: 城市拥堵导致车辆移动效率低下，加剧温室气体排放和城市空气污染。虽然宏观排放基本图(eMFD)可以捕捉网络层面的排放与交通变量关系，但由于历史数据限制，经验推导的eMFD模型稀少。

Conclusion: 该研究使交通管理部门能够测量给定出行需求下的城市交通碳排放，并优化特定位置的交通管理和规划决策，以减少网络范围的排放。

Abstract: Urban congestions cause inefficient movement of vehicles and exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution. Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.

Abstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task.

Motivation: 通过在髙维向量空间中编码图灵完备语法，增加神经网络状态的表达能力，使网络状态能够包含任意结构化的、固有可解释的表示。

Method: 使用频率域全息降维表示(FHRRs)扩展向量符号架构(VSA)编码，结合残差超维计算(RHC)实现算术操作原语。

Result: 实现了在髙维向量空间中编码图灵完备语法的能力，使神经网络状态能够包含结构化表示。

Conclusion: 这种VSA编码在机器学习任务中具有潜在应用价值，强调编码结构化表示和设计对表示结构敏感的网络行为对于实现更通用的智能代理的重要性。

Abstract: Using Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs), we extend a Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) encoding of Lisp 1.5 with primitives for arithmetic operations using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC). Encoding a Turing-complete syntax over a high-dimensional vector space increases the expressivity of neural network states, enabling network states to contain arbitrarily structured representations that are inherently interpretable. We discuss the potential applications of the VSA encoding in machine learning tasks, as well as the importance of encoding structured representations and designing neural networks whose behavior is sensitive to the structure of their representations in virtue of attaining more general intelligent agents than exist at present.

Motivation: 偏差-方差分解是统计学和机器学习的核心结果，但通常只针对平方误差。作者希望提供一个适用于更广泛误差度量（Bregman散度）的分解方法，并给出清晰的推导过程用于教学目的。

Method: 作者提供了Bregman散度下偏差-方差分解的独立、清晰的推导过程，这是对传统平方误差分解的推广。

We present a generalization of the bias-variance decomposition where the prediction error is a Bregman divergence, which is relevant to maximum likelihood estimation with exponential families. While the result is already known, there was not previously a clear, standalone derivation, so we provide one for pedagogical purposes. A version of this note previously appeared on the author's personal website without context. Here we provide additional discussion and references to the relevant prior literature.

*Hiro Ishii,Kenta Niwa,Hiroshi Sawada,Akinori Fujino,Noboru Harada,Rio Yokota*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPM是一种新的联邦学习方法，通过引入预条件混合机制解决局部预条件器漂移问题，显著提升二阶优化在异构数据环境下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习中的二阶优化方法（如LocalNewton、LTDA、FedSophia）在异构数据环境下存在局部预条件器漂移问题，这会严重破坏参数训练的收敛性。

Method: 通过将理想的二阶更新分解为服务器端的参数混合和客户端的局部参数更新，在服务器端引入预条件混合机制来有效缓解局部预条件器漂移。

Result: 理论分析显示在强凸目标和单次局部更新场景下具有超线性收敛速率；实验结果表明FedPM在测试准确率上相比传统简单混合方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: FedPM通过预条件混合机制成功解决了局部预条件器漂移问题，充分发挥了二阶优化在联邦学习中的潜力。

Abstract: We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BayesQ是一个基于贝叶斯后验期望损失优化的后训练量化框架，通过拟合权重的高斯后验、白化处理、码本设计和混合精度分配，在3.0/3.5/4.0比特下显著优于GPTQ等基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量化方法未考虑权重不确定性，BayesQ首次在量化中优化后验期望损失，将低比特量化重新定义为不确定性感知的风险最小化问题。

Method: 拟合权重高斯后验，通过后验协方差白化，设计最小化后验期望失真的码本，使用贪心背包算法分配混合精度，支持标量量化器的闭式解和任务感知代理的蒙特卡洛方法。

Result: 在ResNet-50和BERT-base上，相比GPTQ分别提升1.5/0.7/0.3个top-1百分点和1.1/0.4/0.2个GLUE分数，预处理时间与GPTQ相当。

Conclusion: BayesQ将低比特量化重构为实用的后训练流程中的不确定性感知风险最小化，在保持效率的同时显著提升量化性能。

Abstract: We present BayesQ, an uncertainty-guided post-training quantization framework that is the first to optimize quantization under the posterior expected loss. BayesQ fits a lightweight Gaussian posterior over weights (diagonal Laplace by default; optional K-FAC/low-rank), whitens by the posterior covariance, designs codebooks to minimize posterior-expected distortion, and allocates mixed precision via a greedy knapsack that maximizes marginal expected-loss reduction per bit under a global budget. For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. At matched average bits/weight of 3.0/3.5/4.0, BayesQ improves over strong PTQ baselines on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) e.g., vs. GPTQ by $+1.5/+0.7/+0.3$ top-1 percentage points on RN50 and $+1.1/+0.4/+0.2$ GLUE points on BERT, while requiring one-time preprocessing comparable to a GPTQ pass. BayesQ reframes low-bit quantization as uncertainty-aware risk minimization in a practical, post-training pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂动态系统的设计和操作中，确保所有状态轨迹收敛到期望平衡点至关重要，但稳定性区域通常难以计算。现有方法依赖系统控制方程的显式知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出LyapInf方法，假设未知Lyapunov函数为二次形式，通过最小化Zubov方程的平均残差来拟合未知二次算子，从而推断Lyapunov函数。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法成功表征了与推断Lyapunov函数相关的系统稳定性区域的近最大椭球体，无需系统控制方程知识。

Conclusion: LyapInf方法提供了一种有效的黑盒稳定性分析方法，能够从轨迹数据推断Lyapunov函数并估计稳定性区域，适用于缺乏系统控制方程显式知识的实际应用场景。

Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数MARL方法依赖静态或每步关系图，忽略了智能体适应、移动或重组合作策略时自然出现的时间演化交互。捕获这种演化依赖关系对于实现鲁棒和自适应协调至关重要。

Method: TIGER构建MARL智能体的动态时间图，连接当前和历史交互，使用时序注意力编码器聚合结构和时间邻域信息，生成时间感知的智能体嵌入来指导合作策略学习。

Conclusion: 全面的消融研究揭示了结构和时间因素如何共同塑造MARL中有效的策略学习，验证了TIGER方法的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DP-PMLF方法，通过结合逐样本动量和低通滤波策略，同时缓解差分隐私SGD中的噪声和裁剪偏差问题，改善隐私-效用权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的差分隐私SGD方法通常只能解决噪声或裁剪偏差中的一个问题，减少DP噪声会加剧裁剪偏差，反之亦然，需要一种能同时缓解两者的方法。

Method: DP-PMLF结合逐样本动量（在裁剪前平滑梯度估计以减少采样方差）和后处理低通滤波（在不消耗额外隐私预算的情况下衰减高频DP噪声）。

Result: 理论分析显示在严格DP保证下收敛率得到改善，实证评估表明DP-PMLF相比现有DPSGD变体显著提升了隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: DP-PMLF通过同时缓解DP噪声和裁剪偏差，为差分隐私深度学习提供了一种有效的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to train deep neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拓扑描述符在关系数据的多尺度结构信息捕捉中应用日益广泛，但图乘积上的拓扑描述符研究相对缺乏，需要系统分析其表达能力和计算方法。

Method: 考虑图乘积上的各种过滤方法，建立欧拉特征在颜色过滤上的表达能力理论表征，证明持续同调的信息优势，并提供顶点和边级过滤的持续同调图计算算法。

Result: 理论分析表明持续同调在图乘积中比单个图包含严格更多信息，而欧拉特征不具备此优势；实证研究验证了运行时间分析、表达能力和图分类性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过乘积过滤为强大的图持续描述符开辟了道路，代码已开源供进一步研究使用。

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.

TL;DR: 提出了两种GNN无关的图超分辨率框架：Bi-SR通过二分图连接低分辨率和高分辨率节点实现结构感知的节点超分辨率，DEFEND通过将高分辨率边映射到对偶图节点来学习边表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图超分辨率方法存在两个关键问题：基于矩阵的节点超分辨率忽略了图结构且缺乏置换不变性；依赖节点表示推断边权重限制了可扩展性和表达能力。

Method: Bi-SR框架使用二分图连接LR和HR节点，保持拓扑结构和置换不变性；DEFEND框架将HR边映射到对偶图节点，使用标准节点GNN进行边推断。

Result: 在真实脑连接组数据集上，两种框架在七个拓扑度量上均达到最先进性能；还引入了12个模拟数据集用于全面基准测试。

Conclusion: 提出的GNN无关框架解决了现有方法的局限性，在保持图结构的同时实现了有效的图超分辨率，为资源受限领域提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Graph super-resolution, the task of inferring high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) counterparts, is an underexplored yet crucial research direction that circumvents the need for costly data acquisition. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

Result: 成功分解玩具归纳头模型并恢复预期的2步电路；在GPT-2-small中定位到"高尔夫"、"篮球"等可解释概念对应的子组件

Conclusion: 这是将SPD扩展到现代模型的第一步，证明该方法可用于发现可解释的参数空间机制

Abstract: Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that decomposing models in parameter space may yield clean handles for analysis and intervention. Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

Result: 在美国西部512个SNOTEL站点数据上的评估显示，相比现有方法在预测准确性和预测区间方面都有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该模型为水资源管理社区提供了一个部署和反馈平台，突出了不同方法在不确定性估计方面的有效性。

Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.

TL;DR: EEG-X是一个设备无关且抗噪声的脑电图基础模型，通过位置通道嵌入和噪声感知重建策略解决EEG数据变异性大和信噪比低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG分析中的两个关键挑战：(1)不同设备和配置导致的数据集变异性，(2)EEG信号信噪比低，脑信号常被伪迹和非脑源噪声淹没。

Method: 提出位置通道嵌入处理不同通道配置；采用噪声感知掩码重建策略，在原始和潜在空间重建去噪信号；引入字典启发的卷积变换层(DiCT)来结构化特征空间。

Result: 在多个不同设备收集的数据集上，EEG-X在多个下游EEG任务中优于最先进方法，在电极布局不同的跨域设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: EEG-X通过创新的位置嵌入和噪声鲁棒训练策略，成功建立了设备无关且抗噪声的EEG基础模型，在跨域任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

Motivation: 传统人工睡眠分期耗时且存在评分者间差异，现有深度学习模型主要依赖原始PSG信号，忽略了人类专家使用的上下文线索。

Method: 使用两阶段架构：Transformer-based每时段编码器 + 1D CNN聚合器，系统性地整合临床元数据（年龄、性别、BMI）和专家事件注释（呼吸暂停、血氧下降、觉醒、周期性呼吸）。

Result: 相比仅使用PSG的基线模型（macro-F1 0.7745，micro-F1 0.8774），最终模型达到macro-F1 0.8031和micro-F1 0.9051，事件注释贡献最大增益，特征融合优于多任务学习方案。

Conclusion: 将临床有意义特征与学习表示相结合可显著提升性能和可解释性，无需修改PSG配置或额外传感器，为实现上下文感知的专家级睡眠分期系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCA在低方差方向和低样本情况下表现不佳，而VNNs需要训练且在有标签设置下工作。CSTs旨在结合两者的优点，提供无需训练但表达能力强的协方差表示。

Method: 使用协方差小波作为滤波器，在协方差谱中应用局部化滤波器，通过非线性产生层次表示，并采用剪枝机制提高计算和内存效率。

Result: 在4个神经退行性疾病数据集上的年龄预测实验中，CSTs在低数据设置下产生稳定表示，无需训练即可达到与复杂学习模型相当或更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: CSTs结合了PCA和VNNs的优点，在无需训练的情况下提供稳定且表达能力强的协方差表示，特别适用于低样本场景。

Abstract: Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.

Method: 使用频谱可预测性指标Ω来系统性地分层模型家族性能，在四个不同领域进行控制实验，并在GIFT-Eval基准的51个模型和28个数据集上扩展分析。

Result: 发现当Ω高时，大型时序基础模型(TSFMs)系统性地优于轻量级任务训练基线，而当Ω下降时其优势消失。计算Ω每个数据集仅需几秒钟。

Conclusion: Ω能够可预测地分层模型性能，提供了一个实用的初步筛选工具，既降低了验证成本，又凸显了需要开发在真正困难(低Ω)问题上表现出色的模型。

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

Conclusion: Weaver通过创新的注意力分解和高效消息传递机制，在保持竞争性预测性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，为交通网络时空预测提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.

Conclusion: DIVO在离线强化学习中成功实现了保守性与探索性的关键平衡，通过价值条件优化机制有效提升了策略性能。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for neural networks on tabular data is critical to a wide range of applications, yet it remains challenging due to large, non-convex search spaces and the cost of exhaustive tuning. We introduce the Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimizer for Neural Networks (QIBONN), a bilevel framework that encodes feature selection, architectural hyperparameters, and regularization in a unified qubit-based representation. By combining deterministic quantum-inspired rotations with stochastic qubit mutations guided by a global attractor, QIBONN balances exploration and exploitation under a fixed evaluation budget. We conduct systematic experiments under single-qubit bit-flip noise (0.1\%--1\%) emulated by an IBM-Q backend. Results on 13 real-world datasets indicate that QIBONN is competitive with established methods, including classical tree-based methods and both classical/quantum-inspired HPO algorithms under the same tuning budget.

Conclusion: 该方法通过准确重构TAC值，显著提升了后门神经元识别的精确度，在各种场景下都优于现有的防御方法。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.

Motivation: 传统的变分自编码器和生成对抗网络已被扩散模型超越，但改进传统模型的研究停滞不前。本文旨在探索条件变分自编码器在图像生成中的应用，解决VAE生成图像模糊和多样性不足的问题。

Method: 1. 将高斯解码器的方差作为可学习参数进行训练；2. 使用标准化流估计潜在空间在给定标签下的条件分布，而不是假设其等于先验分布。

Result: 与现有方法相比，该方法将FID降低了5%，对数似然提高了7.7%，实现了更好的图像生成效果。

Conclusion: 通过改进条件变分自编码器的训练方法，特别是使用标准化流来准确建模潜在空间的条件分布，可以显著提升传统生成模型的性能。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks remained the state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models until 2022. Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.

Conclusion: Bayesian-MoE为可靠的下游决策提供了有效的后验不确定性估计框架。

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

Result: 在语言建模和图像分类任务中，SSR实现了更快的训练速度、更高的准确率和更强的输入损坏鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SSR方法通过最优传输理论有效解决了SMoE模型的专家平衡问题，无需辅助损失即可获得更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has gained prominence as a scalable and computationally efficient architecture, enabling significant growth in model capacity without incurring additional inference costs. However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection. Across both language modeling and image classification tasks, SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption.

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

Motivation: 联邦学习面临数据分布差异（如协变量偏移和语义偏移）严重影响实际部署可靠性的问题，现有不变学习方法在准确捕捉不变特征和直接构建因果表示方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出FedSDWC因果推理方法，整合不变特征和可变特征，通过建模两者间的弱因果影响来推断因果语义表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了FedSDWC在处理协变量和语义偏移方面的优越性能，在CIFAR-10上平均比次优基线FedICON高出3.04%，在CIFAR-100上高出8.11%。

Conclusion: FedSDWC通过因果推理方法有效克服了联邦学习中的数据分布差异问题，显著提升了泛化能力和OOD检测性能，理论分析还建立了与客户端先验分布的关系。

Abstract: Amid growing demands for data privacy and advances in computational infrastructure, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

Abstract: Fairness in AI-driven stress detection is critical for equitable mental healthcare, yet existing models frequently exhibit gender bias, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. To address this, we propose FairM2S, a fairness-aware meta-learning framework for stress detection leveraging audio-visual data. FairM2S integrates Equalized Odds constraints during both meta-training and adaptation phases, employing adversarial gradient masking and fairness-constrained meta-updates to effectively mitigate bias. Evaluated against five state-of-the-art baselines, FairM2S achieves 78.1% accuracy while reducing the Equal Opportunity to 0.06, demonstrating substantial fairness gains. We also release SAVSD, a smartphone-captured dataset with gender annotations, designed to support fairness research in low-resource, real-world contexts. Together, these contributions position FairM2S as a state-of-the-art approach for equitable and scalable few-shot stress detection in mental health AI. We release our dataset and FairM2S publicly with this paper.

Conclusion: 流形感知聚合对文本属性图学习至关重要，GeoGNN为保持语义流形结构提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) on text--attributed graphs (TAGs) typically encode node texts using pretrained language models (PLMs) and propagate these embeddings through linear neighborhood aggregation. However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning.

Motivation: 现有对决赌博算法在人类反馈稀疏时效率低下，而依赖参数化奖励模型的方法容易因模型设定错误而失效，因此需要探索反馈增强的替代方案。

Method: 引入增强置信边界来整合增强的人类反馈，并在广义集中性属性下分析多因素性能权衡，通过遗憾分析评估算法性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为更广泛应用中可证明高效的交互式偏好获取提供了潜力，展示了模型无关框架在稀疏反馈场景下的有效性。

Abstract: Interactive preference elicitation (IPE) aims to substantially reduce human effort while acquiring human preferences in wide personalization systems. Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis. Our prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several IPE benchmarks, including recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models, demonstrating the potential of our approach for provably efficient IPE in broader applications.

Result: PINN-Proj将守恒误差降低3-4个数量级，略微减少PDE求解误差，并改善损失景观条件促进收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法为PINN中保证任何可处理积分量守恒提供了一个通用框架。

Abstract: We propose a novel projection method that guarantees the conservation of integral quantities in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While the soft constraint that PINNs use to enforce the structure of partial differential equations (PDEs) enables necessary flexibility during training, it also permits the discovered solution to violate physical laws. To address this, we introduce a projection method that guarantees the conservation of the linear and quadratic integrals, both separately and jointly. We derived the projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and found that our PINN modified with the projection, which we call PINN-Proj, reduced the error in the conservation of these quantities by three to four orders of magnitude compared to the soft constraint and marginally reduced the PDE solution error. We also found evidence that the projection improved convergence through improving the conditioning of the loss landscape. Our method holds promise as a general framework to guarantee the conservation of any integral quantity in a PINN if a tractable solution exists.

Conclusion: 通过学习可定制的距离度量，显著提升了分类数据聚类的准确性和适应性，并能无缝扩展到混合数据集。

Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

Conclusion: HCL方法有效平衡了标签质量和人工成本，在弱监督场景中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their powerful content generation capabilities, have been successfully applied to data annotation processes. However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

Motivation: 大型稀疏矩阵在LU分解过程中会产生填充元素，这会增加内存使用和计算时间。现有的重排方法使用代理目标，但没有理论保证与真实填充数量之间的关系。

Method: 使用图编码器预测行列节点得分，通过重参数化技术从节点得分获得置换矩阵，将矩阵重排后计算三角因子，使用交替方向乘子法和近端梯度下降优化目标函数。

Result: 在SuiteSparse基准稀疏矩阵集合上的实验显示，与最先进基线相比，填充数量和LU分解时间分别减少了20%和17.8%。

Conclusion: 提出的重排网络方法能有效减少LU分解中的填充元素，提高计算效率。

Abstract: Fill-ins are new nonzero elements in the summation of the upper and lower triangular factors generated during LU factorization. For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \(l_1\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实系统中的部署增加，理解其脆弱性变得至关重要。虽然RLHF/DPO对齐过程中的数据投毒攻击已有实证研究，但其理论基础仍不清楚。

Method: 将最小成本投毒攻击建模为带线性约束的凸优化问题，推导攻击成本的理论界限，并提出一种后处理方法减少所需标签翻转次数。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RLHF/DPO流程中的基本脆弱性，并提供了评估其对抗低成本投毒攻击鲁棒性的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Class imbalance has been extensively studied in single-view scenarios; however, addressing this challenge in multi-view contexts remains an open problem, with even scarcer research focusing on trustworthy solutions. In this paper, we tackle a particularly challenging class imbalance problem in multi-view scenarios: long-tailed classification. We propose TMLC, a Trusted Multi-view Long-tailed Classification framework, which makes contributions on two critical aspects: opinion aggregation and pseudo-data generation. Specifically, inspired by Social Identity Theory, we design a group consensus opinion aggregation mechanism that guides decision making toward the direction favored by the majority of the group. In terms of pseudo-data generation, we introduce a novel distance metric to adapt SMOTE for multi-view scenarios and develop an uncertainty-guided data generation module that produces high-quality pseudo-data, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on long-tailed multi-view datasets demonstrate that our model is capable of achieving superior performance. The code is released at https://github.com/cncq-tang/TMLC.

Conclusion: 提出的链式框架能够有效估计高斯过程回归的全局和局部不确定性边界，在常用核函数上提供更紧的边界估计，且不依赖特定输入位置或后验方差缩放。

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 自然语言作为LLM智能体通信媒介存在根本限制，将丰富的内部潜在状态下采样为离散token会限制信息传输的深度和细微差别，从而阻碍协作问题解决。

Conclusion: 这项工作作为完全潜在空间智能体间通信的可行性研究，结果突显了其潜力，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督特征选择方法通常单独评估特征，但信息信号往往来自相关特征组。现有方法要么依赖预定义分组，要么需要标签监督，限制了应用范围。

Method: GroupFS通过强制特征图和样本图的拉普拉斯平滑性，并应用组稀疏正则化器来学习紧凑的结构化表示，联合发现特征组并选择信息量最大的组。

Result: 在涵盖图像、表格数据和生物数据集的九个基准测试中，GroupFS在聚类任务上始终优于最先进的无监督特征选择方法，并能选择与有意义模式对齐的特征组。

Conclusion: GroupFS提供了一种有效的无监督特征选择方法，能够自动发现特征组结构并选择信息量最大的组，在多个领域都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (FS) is essential for high-dimensional learning tasks where labels are not available. It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.

Conclusion: 为构建紧凑记忆开辟了新方向，未来也有望用于深度持续学习。

Abstract: Despite recent progress, continual learning still does not match the performance of batch training. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task. Our work opens a new direction for building compact memory that can also be useful in the future for continual deep learning.

*Guojian Wang,Quinson Hon,Xuyang Chen,Lin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFDT是一种解决决策变换器在跨域迁移中轨迹片段拼接问题的紧凑管道，通过两级数据过滤、优势条件令牌和Q引导正则化来恢复拼接性，在D4RL风格控制任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域策略适应方法依赖单一过滤标准选择源轨迹片段，但拼接性差：状态结构不对齐、RTG令牌不连续、动作在轨迹连接处跳跃，这损害了DT的推理能力。

Method: DFDT通过MMD不匹配和OT偏差的两级数据过滤器融合目标数据和可信源片段，用优势条件令牌替换RTG令牌，并应用Q引导正则化抑制连接处的值和动作跳跃。

Result: DFDT在重力、运动学和形态学变化的D4RL风格控制任务中，相比强离线RL和序列模型基线，提高了回报和稳定性，并通过令牌拼接和序列语义稳定性分析验证了这些增益。

Conclusion: DFDT通过恢复轨迹片段的拼接性，有效解决了决策变换器在跨域迁移中的挑战，理论分析表明状态值和策略性能差距与MMD不匹配和OT偏差度量相关，且随着这些度量减小而收紧。

Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

### [88] [FSampler: Training Free Acceleration of Diffusion Sampling via Epsilon Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09180)
*Michael A. Vladimir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSampler是一种无需训练、与采样器无关的执行层，通过减少函数评估次数来加速扩散采样。它利用历史去噪信号进行外推预测，在保持采样器更新规则不变的同时替代部分模型调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型采样过程中需要大量函数评估，计算成本高昂。FSampler旨在减少模型调用次数，从而加速采样过程，同时保持高保真度。

Method: FSampler维护最近模型调用的去噪信号历史，使用二阶、三阶或四阶有限差分预测器外推下一个epsilon。在选定步骤用预测的epsilon替代模型调用，并通过验证机制、学习稳定器和梯度估计稳定器确保稳定性。

Result: 在FLUX.1 dev、Qwen Image和Wan 2.2等模型上，FSampler将时间减少8-22%，模型调用减少15-25%，同时保持高保真度（SSIM 0.95-0.99）。在激进模式下，模型调用可减少45-50%（SSIM 0.73-0.74）。

Conclusion: FSampler提供了一种有效的扩散采样加速方法，兼容多种采样器，无需修改采样器公式，在保持图像质量的同时显著减少计算开销。

Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有群体训练（PBT）方法中，超参数更新间隔是一个重要的元超参数，但没有有效的方法来设置其值，这显著影响算法性能。

Method: IPBT通过重启机制自动调整超参数更新间隔，在任务无关方式下重用权重信息，并使用时变贝叶斯优化重新初始化超参数。

Conclusion: IPBT是一种有效的超参数优化方法，能够自动调整关键元超参数，在多个任务上表现出色且无需额外配置。

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) can lift the burden of tuning hyperparameters (HPs) of neural networks. HPO algorithms from the Population Based Training (PBT) family are efficient thanks to dynamically adjusting HPs every few steps of the weight optimization. Recent results indicate that the number of steps between HP updates is an important meta-HP of all PBT variants that can substantially affect their performance. Yet, no method or intuition is available for efficiently setting its value. We introduce Iterated Population Based Training (IPBT), a novel PBT variant that automatically adjusts this HP via restarts that reuse weight information in a task-agnostic way and leverage time-varying Bayesian optimization to reinitialize HPs. Evaluation on 8 image classification and reinforcement learning tasks shows that, on average, our algorithm matches or outperforms 5 previous PBT variants and other HPO algorithms (random search, ASHA, SMAC3), without requiring a budget increase or any changes to its HPs.

Motivation: 现有AI生成文本检测器训练数据集存在质量问题，特别是DetectRL数据集中98.5%的Claude-LLM数据包含简单生成模式，这些模式可能被检测器用作捷径，导致易受欺骗攻击。

Method: 对DetectRL数据集进行多种清洗操作，移除AI生成文本中的简单模式，如开头语"Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:"和LLM拒绝任务的情况。

Conclusion: 数据清洗是提高AI生成文本检测器安全性的有效方法，处理后的数据集已公开可用，有助于更可靠的检测器训练和评估。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for many applications. To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.

TL;DR: CoCo-MILP通过建模变量间对比和约束内竞争关系，显著提升了混合整数线性规划问题的求解效率，将解差距减少了68.12%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络的方法在MILP求解中存在两个层面的错位：学习目标层面，二元交叉熵损失独立处理变量，忽略了相对优先级；模型架构层面，标准GNN消息传递平滑了变量表示，忽略了约束内的竞争关系。

Method: 提出CoCo-MILP框架，包含变量间对比损失(VCL)和约束内竞争GNN层，前者最大化变量赋值为1和0之间的嵌入边界，后者学习区分约束内竞争变量的表示。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，CoCo-MILP显著优于现有学习方法，相比传统求解器将解差距减少了68.12%。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模变量间对比和约束内竞争关系，CoCo-MILP能够更有效地预测MILP的高质量解，为组合优化问题提供了新的学习范式。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet solving large-scale instances remains a significant computational challenge. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该框架在聚类数量未知的场景下优于现有聚类方法

Conclusion: SCMax框架提供了一种完全无参数的聚类解决方案，通过自监督共识最大化自动确定最佳聚类结构

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的蛋白质结构生成模型难以引导结果朝向特定功能或生化目标（如结合亲和力或序列组成）。需要一种能够在推理时控制生成过程的方法。

Method: 将Feynman-Kac引导框架与结构生成耦合，通过ProteinMPNN和全原子松弛精炼模型计算奖励函数，引导采样朝向理想的结构或能量特征。

Result: 应用于结合剂设计时，FK引导持续改善了预测的界面能量学，且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: 推理时FK控制将基于扩散的蛋白质设计推广到任意、不可微分且奖励不可知的目标，为引导分子生成提供了统一且模型无关的框架。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

Conclusion: 基于模型的强化学习方法能够有效学习分支定界动态，通过内部模型规划改进分支策略，为MILP求解提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) lies at the core of many real-world combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, traditionally solved by branch-and-bound (B&B). A key driver influencing B&B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies. Computational experiments empirically validate our approach, with our MBRL branching agent outperforming previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in tackling combinatorial optimization problems. However, existing methods still suffer from limited accuracy when addressing that on complex graphs and exhibit poor scalability, since full training requires loading the whole adjacent matrix and all embeddings at a time, the it may results in out of memory of a single machine. This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency. Moreover, the experiments on large graph instances also validate the scalability of the model.

Abstract: Predictive coding is a framework for understanding the formation of low-dimensional internal representations mirroring the environment's latent structure. The conditions under which such representations emerge remain unclear. In this work, we investigate how the prediction horizon and network depth shape the solutions of predictive coding tasks. Using a minimal abstract setting inspired by prior work, we show empirically and theoretically that sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure, a phenomenon explained through the Ordinary Least Squares estimator structure and biases in learning dynamics. We then extend these insights to nonlinear networks and complex datasets, including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states and higher dimensional state geometries. Our results provide a principled understanding of when and why predictive coding induces structured representations, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.

Conclusion: DFA攻击揭示了联邦学习面临的新威胁维度，GuardFed提供了一种有效的自适应防御方案，能同时保护模型效用和群体公平性

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

Conclusion: RENTT提供了一种运行时和内存高效的神经网络到决策树的精确转换方法，解决了可解释AI中的忠实性问题，并通过等效决策树实现了真实特征重要性的计算。

Abstract: Although neural networks are a powerful tool, their widespread use is hindered by the opacity of their decisions and their black-box nature, which result in a lack of trustworthiness. To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP. All code is available at https://github.com/HelenaM23/RENTT .

Abstract: It is challenging to reduce the complexity of neural networks while maintaining their generalization ability and robustness, especially for practical applications. Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\%-3\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer.

Method: 提出MoC架构，基于SwiGLU的天然门控机制，为每个token选择性激活前K个最相关通道，在预训练中减少激活内存，并通过部分权重加载到GPU SRAM来提高推理效率。

Result: 实验验证MoC能显著节省内存并提高吞吐量，同时保持有竞争力的模型性能。

Conclusion: MoC架构有效解决了LLM中FFN激活内存瓶颈问题，在保持性能的同时实现了内存节省和效率提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse artificial intelligence tasks, driven by scaling laws that correlate model size and training data with performance improvements. However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM. Extensive experiments validate that MoC delivers significant memory savings and throughput gains while maintaining competitive model performance.

TL;DR: MARBLE模型扩展了传统RMAB，引入了潜在马尔可夫状态来处理非平稳环境。提出了马尔可夫平均可索引性准则，证明了QWI算法在潜在状态切换下能收敛到最优策略。

Motivation: 传统RMAB假设固定动态，这在非平稳环境中往往不成立。需要开发能处理潜在状态切换的模型来应对现实世界中的动态变化。

Method: 引入MARBLE模型，包含潜在马尔可夫环境状态；提出马尔可夫平均可索引性准则；使用同步Q学习与Whittle索引算法。

Conclusion: MARBLE模型和QWI算法能有效处理非平稳环境中的决策问题，为动态环境下的多臂赌博机问题提供了理论保证和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are powerful models for decision-making under uncertainty, yet classical formulations typically assume fixed dynamics, an assumption often violated in nonstationary environments. We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.

Motivation: 复杂黑盒AI模型的普及增加了对其决策进行解释的需求，但特征归因方法领域历史上缺乏正式的问题定义。

Method: 提出了DFAX（Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations），一种新颖的模型无关特征归因方法，基于给定数据集表示的基础概率分布来支持解释。

Result: 实验表明DFAX比最先进的基线方法更有效和高效。

Conclusion: DFAX通过引入正式的特征归因问题定义，并基于数据分布直接解释分类器预测，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: WOODELF是一个新的SHAP算法，通过将决策树、博弈论和布尔逻辑整合到统一框架中，能够在线性时间内计算Background SHAP值，相比现有方法在CPU和GPU上分别实现了16倍和165倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SHAP计算方法效率较低，特别是在处理大规模数据集时。Path-Dependent SHAP和Background SHAP两种主流方法各有局限，需要更高效的算法来支持金融、广告、医疗等领域的大规模应用。

Method: WOODELF为每个消费者构建一个伪布尔公式，捕捉其特征值、决策树集成结构和整个背景数据集。利用这种表示在线性时间内计算Background SHAP值，同时支持Path-Dependent SHAP、Shapley交互值、Banzhaf值等多种博弈论值的计算。

Result: 在包含300万行、500万背景样本和127个特征的数据集上，WOODELF在CPU上计算所有Background Shapley值仅需162秒，在GPU上仅需16秒，而现有最佳方法需要44分钟，分别实现了16倍和165倍的加速。

Conclusion: WOODELF提供了一个高效、统一的框架来计算SHAP和其他博弈论值，支持CPU和GPU硬件，能够满足实际应用中大规模计算的需求，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a key tool for interpreting decision tree ensembles by assigning contribution values to features. It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.
  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.
  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.
  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.

TL;DR: 使用条件扩散模型插值稀疏采样的sinogram数据，以支持无约束探测器布局的PET成像


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET成像需要支持无约束探测器布局（从walk-through设计到长轴环），这些布局中的间隙和开放侧会导致严重欠采样的sinogram数据，而不是约束硬件形成完整圆柱体

Method: 将缺失的响应线视为可学习先验，探索使用条件扩散模型来插值稀疏采样的sinogram

Result: 为在真实临床环境中实现新颖、成本效益高且患者友好的PET几何结构铺平道路

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法特别是生成模型为恢复缺失信息提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Accurate PET imaging increasingly requires methods that support unconstrained detector layouts from walk-through designs to long-axial rings where gaps and open sides lead to severely undersampled sinograms. Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

TL;DR: 提出CREAT方法，通过约束强化学习实现用户画像污染攻击，在保持隐蔽性的同时诱导目标误预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列推荐系统容易受到对抗攻击，但传统数据投毒攻击需要大规模用户访问或虚假资料，缺乏实用性。现有PPA方法存在过度依赖序列水平影响和导致可检测分布偏移的问题

Method: 提出CREAT方法，结合双层优化框架和多奖励强化学习：1）模式平衡奖励策略，整合模式反转奖励和分布一致性奖励；2）约束组相对强化学习范式，通过动态屏障约束和组共享经验回放实现逐步扰动

Result: 大量实验证明了CREAT的有效性

Conclusion: CREAT方法能够平衡攻击效果和隐蔽性，在最小化可检测性的同时实现目标污染

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

Conclusion: AGT填补了训练数据扰动认证的研究空白，为对抗性数据投毒、机器去学习和差分隐私等场景提供了形式化的认证方法。

Abstract: The impact of inference-time data perturbation (e.g., adversarial attacks) has been extensively studied in machine learning, leading to well-established certification techniques for adversarial robustness. In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDPR和CCPA等隐私法规要求对未授权数据进行完全遗忘，但现有方法在时空图上无法高效删除单个节点，成本接近完全重新训练

Method: 采用分区-征服策略，包含增强子图构建(ESC)和全局神经节桥接(GGB)两种技术，灵感来自大脑胼胝体结构

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，CallosumNet仅产生1%-2%的相对MAE损失，显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: CallosumNet框架为时空图数据遗忘提供了高效解决方案，验证了所提技术的有效性

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PTE的无保留遗忘框架，通过探测-编辑过程实现选择性遗忘，仅需遗忘数据和原始模型即可完成高效知识编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态工业物联网环境中，模型需要选择性遗忘过时或错误知识。现有方法依赖保留数据约束模型行为，增加了计算和能源负担，且与工业数据孤岛和隐私合规要求冲突。

Method: PTE将遗忘构建为探测-编辑过程：首先通过梯度上升探测模型在待遗忘类别决策边界邻域，利用模型自身预测生成编辑指令；然后执行推-拉协同优化：推分支使用编辑指令主动拆解目标类别决策区域，拉分支应用掩码知识蒸馏将模型在保留类别上的知识锚定到原始状态。

Result: 实验结果表明，PTE在CWRU和SCUT-FD等多个通用和工业基准上，在遗忘效果和模型效用之间实现了良好平衡。

Conclusion: PTE框架仅使用待遗忘数据和原始模型，实现了高效平衡的知识编辑，解决了传统遗忘方法对保留数据的依赖问题。

Abstract: In dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, models need the ability to selectively forget outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.

Motivation: 传统语义遗传编程依赖固定语法变换，难以学习多样化的结构变化。TSGP旨在利用transformer模型学习能产生相似语义的多样化程序结构变化。

Method: 使用预训练transformer模型作为变异算子，通过控制目标语义距离来生成与父代语义相似但结构不同的子代程序。

Result: 在24个真实世界和合成数据集上，TSGP显著优于标准GP、SLIM_GSGP、深度符号回归和去噪自编码器GP，平均排名1.58，且比SLIM_GSGP产生更紧凑的解。

Conclusion: TSGP证明了预训练transformer模型在语义遗传编程中的有效性，目标语义距离提供了平衡探索与利用的有效机制。

Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

Abstract: Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze the feature learning characteristic property of neural networks in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parametrized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several supporting evidences for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.

Conclusion: 将群对称性纳入稀疏自编码器可以产生更有用的特征，自适应等变SAEs在探测性能上优于传统方法，突显了在可解释性工具中考虑对称性的重要性。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven useful in disentangling the opaque activations of neural networks, primarily large language models, into sets of interpretable features. However, adapting them to domains beyond language, such as scientific data with group symmetries, introduces challenges that can hinder their effectiveness. We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks. More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated. Building on this, we develop adaptively equivariant SAEs that can adapt to the base model's level of equivariance. These adaptive SAEs discover features that lead to superior probing performance compared to regular SAEs, demonstrating the value of incorporating symmetries in mechanistic interpretability tools.

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.

TL;DR: SOLIS通过学习评估对齐的嵌入空间，将规划简化为潜在空间中的向量操作，在约束条件下达到竞争性水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否可以直接在评估对齐的嵌入空间中进行规划，而不是训练策略或价值头

Method: 使用监督对比学习学习评估对齐的嵌入空间，其中结果相似性通过邻近度捕获，单个全局优势向量从输到赢区域定向空间

Result: 在象棋中，SOLIS仅使用浅层搜索就能在约束条件下达到竞争性强度

Conclusion: 评估对齐的潜在规划为传统动态模型或策略学习提供了轻量级替代方案

Abstract: Planning in high-dimensional decision spaces is increasingly being studied through the lens of learned representations. Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

Conclusion: AdaCuRL通过自适应课程学习有效解决了强化学习在推理任务中的关键挑战，为LLMs的推理能力提升提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

Conclusion: 基于概率密度的核心集选择方法能够有效提升持续学习的性能，同时保持计算效率，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency.

TL;DR: AutoSynth是一个无需参考数据集就能自动发现和优化工作流的框架，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和新型无数据集混合奖励来解决冷启动问题，显著减少人工工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调需要高质量数据集但人工标注成本高昂，现有自动化方法存在冷启动问题，需要标注数据集进行奖励建模，这在主观开放式任务中尤其困难。

Method: 将问题重构为蒙特卡洛树搜索，使用无数据集混合奖励进行元学习，包含两个LLM作为评判员组件：一个评估样本质量，另一个评估工作流代码和提示质量。

Result: 在主观教育任务中，专家设计的工作流获得更高的人类偏好率(96-99% vs 40-51%)，但使用AutoSynth生成数据训练的模型显著优于基线(40-51% vs 2-5%)，在某些指标上匹配或超越专家工作流，同时将人工工作量从5-7小时减少到30分钟(减少90%以上)。

Conclusion: AutoSynth解决了数据中心AI中的冷启动问题，为主观LLM任务提供了可扩展、经济高效的方法，能够发现超越人类直觉的质量维度。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks requires high-quality datasets, but manual curation is prohibitively expensive. Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth.

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法相比标准确定性actor-critic基线实现了改进的收敛性和性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的二阶确定性actor-critic框架是通用的，适用于任何可微策略类，能够有效利用曲率信息加速收敛。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么关注特定基因变异对有限表型的影响，要么依赖人工整理的遗传信息，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力。直接从基因序列广泛预测多种表型异常仍未被充分探索。

Method: 采用对比多标签学习目标捕捉表型间相关性，结合排他性正则化确保生物学一致性，并引入基因功能瓶颈层提供可解释的功能机制概念。

Conclusion: GenePheno为从基因序列直接预测表型异常提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案，有助于推动假设驱动的实验研究。

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

Conclusion: 数字时域计算方法为Tsetlin机器推理提供了一种高效的解决方案，显著降低了计算成本和功耗。

Abstract: Machine learning fits model parameters to approximate input-output mappings, predicting unknown samples. However, these models often require extensive arithmetic computations during inference, increasing latency and power consumption. This paper proposes a digital-time-domain computing approach for Tsetlin machine (TM) inference process to address these challenges. This approach leverages a delay accumulation mechanism to mitigate the costly arithmetic sums of classes and employs a Winner-Takes-All scheme to replace conventional magnitude comparators. Specifically, a Hamming distance-driven time-domain scheme is implemented for multi-class TMs. Furthermore, differential delay paths, combined with a leading-ones-detector logarithmic delay compression digital-time-domain scheme, are utilised for the coalesced TMs, accommodating both binary-signed and exponential-scale delay accumulation issues. Compared to the functionally equivalent, post-implementation digital TM architecture baseline, the proposed architecture demonstrates orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and throughput.

Motivation: 现有计算方法要么忽略结构上下文，要么依赖昂贵的内存密集型编码，限制了药物发现的吞吐量和可扩展性。需要一种既能保持化学有效性又能与蛋白质结合口袋结构兼容的配体设计方法。

Method: SiDGen采用蛋白质条件扩散框架，集成掩码SMILES生成和轻量级折叠特征。支持两种调节路径：简化模式从蛋白质嵌入中汇集粗略结构信号，完整模式注入局部成对偏差以实现更强耦合。使用粗步幅折叠机制和最近邻上采样来缓解对张量的二次内存成本。

Abstract: Designing ligands that are both chemically valid and structurally compatible with protein binding pockets is a key bottleneck in computational drug discovery. Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths. Learning stability is maintained through in-loop chemical validity checks and an invalidity penalty, while large-scale training efficiency is restored \textit{via} selective compilation, dataloader tuning, and gradient accumulation. In automated benchmarks, SiDGen generates ligands with high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, while achieving competitive performance in docking-based evaluations and maintaining reasonable molecular properties. These results demonstrate that SiDGen can deliver scalable, pocket-aware molecular design, providing a practical route to conditional generation for high-throughput drug discovery.

Motivation: 解决在有限标注平行语料库场景下的机器翻译训练问题，通过教导模型避免生成语言无效的输出来提高数据效率。

Method: 将语言约束编码为严重性加权的惩罚项集成到损失函数中，生成违反目标语言语法的合成样本，当模型对这些语言无效输出分配高概率时进行明确惩罚。

Result: 在所有架构上都实现了改进：性能良好模型获得3-12% BLEU提升，缺乏良好初始支持的模型获得56-89%提升。NSL-MT提供5倍数据效率倍增器——使用1,000个样本训练达到或超过正常使用5,000个样本训练的效果。

Conclusion: NSL-MT为有限标注平行语料库场景提供了一种数据高效的替代训练方法。

Abstract: We introduce Negative Space Learning MT (NSL-MT), a training method that teaches models what not to generate by encoding linguistic constraints as severity-weighted penalties in the loss function. NSL-MT increases limited parallel data with synthetically generated violations of target language grammar, explicitly penalizing the model when it assigns high probability to these linguistically invalid outputs. We demonstrate that NSL-MT delivers improvements across all architectures: 3-12\% BLEU gains for well-performing models and 56-89\% gains for models lacking descent initial support. Furthermore, NSL-MT provides a 5x data efficiency multiplier -- training with 1,000 examples matches or exceeds normal training with 5,000 examples. Thus, NSL-MT provides a data-efficient alternative training method for settings where there is limited annotated parallel corporas.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based beam weighting framework that couples a policy network with an augmented weighted least squares (WLS) estimator for accurate and low-complexity positioning in multi-beam LEO constellations. Unlike conventional geometry or CSI-dependent approaches, the policy learns directly from uplink pilot responses and geometry features, enabling robust localization without explicit CSI estimation. An augmented WLS jointly estimates position and receiver clock bias, improving numerical stability under dynamic beam geometry. Across representative scenarios, the proposed method reduces the mean positioning error by 99.3% compared with the geometry-based baseline, achieving 0.395 m RMSE with near real-time inference.

Conclusion: 所提出的结构化潜在空间合成方法能够有效处理组合运动的非线性特性，显著提高对未见组合运动的分类性能。

Abstract: Electromyogram (EMG)-based motion classification using machine learning has been widely employed in applications such as prosthesis control. While previous studies have explored generating synthetic patterns of combined motions to reduce training data requirements, these methods assume that combined motions can be represented as linear combinations of basic motions. However, this assumption often fails due to complex neuromuscular phenomena such as muscle co-contraction, resulting in low-fidelity synthetic signals and degraded classification performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that learns to synthesize combined motion patterns in a structured latent space. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode EMG signals into a low-dimensional representation and introduce a mixconsistency loss that structures the latent space such that combined motions are embedded between their constituent basic motions. Synthetic patterns are then generated within this structured latent space and used to train classifiers for recognizing unseen combined motions. We validated our approach through upper-limb motion classification experiments with eight healthy participants. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms input-space synthesis approaches, achieving approximately 30% improvement in accuracy.

Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

Result: 在物体和相机运动基准测试中，TTM在真实感和运动控制方面匹配或超过了现有的基于训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: TTM提供了一种轻量级的采样过程修改，无需额外训练或运行时成本，兼容任何骨干网络，实现了精确的外观和运动控制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探索了自回归逐像素预测的缩放特性，发现在固定32x32分辨率下，图像分类和生成任务的最优缩放策略存在显著差异，且随着分辨率增加，模型规模需比数据规模增长更快。计算能力而非训练数据量是主要瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自回归逐像素预测这一简单但未被充分研究的统一视觉模型框架的缩放特性，为未来视觉模型发展提供指导。

Method: 使用IsoFlops配置文件训练一系列Transformer模型，计算预算高达7e19 FLOPs，评估三个目标指标：逐像素预测目标、ImageNet分类准确率和生成质量（Fr'echet距离）。

Result: 1. 最优缩放策略高度依赖任务，在32x32分辨率下，生成任务最优设置需要数据规模比分类任务快3-5倍增长；2. 分辨率增加时，模型规模需比数据规模增长更快；3. 主要瓶颈是计算能力而非训练数据量。

Conclusion: 基于计算能力每年增长4-5倍的预测，逐像素图像建模在未来五年内具有可行性，为统一视觉模型的发展提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种基于EfficientNet的深度学习方法来分类胶质母细胞瘤的6个组织病理学亚区域，在训练数据上表现优异（F1=0.98），但在验证和测试数据上性能显著下降（F1=0.546和0.517），凸显了模型泛化到新数据的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤预后极差，目前缺乏有效的诊断改进。自动识别其组织病理学亚区域有助于大规模形态学理解该疾病。

Method: 采用四步深度学习策略，使用EfficientNet架构（B0-B4）在BraTS-Path 2024数据集上对6个组织病理区域进行分类。

Result: EfficientNet-B1和B4在5折交叉验证中达到F1=0.98，但在验证集和测试集上性能分别降至0.546和0.517。

Conclusion: 模型在训练数据上表现优异，但在新数据上泛化能力有限，这对临床应用至关重要，需要进一步改进模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

TL;DR: NAMEA是一种新颖的集成攻击方法，通过整合集成模型中非注意力区域的梯度来提高对抗样本在不同架构模型间的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成攻击在异构模型架构间的迁移效果不佳，主要原因是异构代理模型的梯度更新方向差异很大，难以在充分利用个体模型的同时减少集成模型的梯度方差。

Method: 设计NAMEA集成攻击，首次将集成模型中非注意力区域的梯度整合到迭代梯度优化过程中。通过元学习方式分别合并注意力区域和非注意力区域的梯度，融合CNN和ViT的迁移信息。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，NAMEA比当前最先进的集成攻击AdaEA和SMER分别平均高出15.0%和9.6%。

Conclusion: 这是首次探索集成非注意力在提升跨架构可迁移性方面的能力，为发起集成攻击提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Ensemble attacks integrate the outputs of surrogate models with diverse architectures, which can be combined with various gradient-based attacks to improve adversarial transferability. However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively. This work is the first attempt to explore the power of ensemble non-attention in boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching ensemble attacks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏因果控制、交互性和长视野一致性，而现有世界模型往往局限于特定领域，难以泛化到多样化环境和交互形式。

Method: 采用生成潜在预测(GLP)架构，结合基于大语言模型的自回归潜在动态主干和视频扩散解码器，在大规模视频-动作对数据上训练。

Result: 实验表明PAN在动作条件世界模拟、长视野预测和模拟推理方面表现优异，优于其他视频生成器和世界模型。

Conclusion: PAN向通用世界模型迈进一步，能够为推理和行动提供未来世界状态的预测模拟。

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

Motivation: 现有EHR数据提取工具在表达性和可用性之间存在权衡，且通常只支持单一数据标准，难以编写适用于现代建模流程的时间查询。

Method: 开发了TempoQL工具包，提供简单易读的时间查询语言，支持OMOP、MEDS等多种EHR数据标准，并包含基于笔记本的交互式查询界面和LLM辅助编写功能。

Result: 性能评估和两个用例表明，TempoQL在保持精度、速度和可重复性的同时，简化了机器学习队列的创建过程。

Conclusion: TempoQL降低了EHR数据提取和验证的门槛，使研究人员和临床医生能够更轻松地创建用于机器学习的队列。

Abstract: Electronic health record (EHR) data is an essential data source for machine learning for health, but researchers and clinicians face steep barriers in extracting and validating EHR data for modeling. Existing tools incur trade-offs between expressivity and usability and are typically specialized to a single data standard, making it difficult to write temporal queries that are ready for modern model-building pipelines and adaptable to new datasets. This paper introduces TempoQL, a Python-based toolkit designed to lower these barriers. TempoQL provides a simple, human-readable language for temporal queries; support for multiple EHR data standards, including OMOP, MEDS, and others; and an interactive notebook-based query interface with optional large language model (LLM) authoring assistance. Through a performance evaluation and two use cases on different datasets, we demonstrate that TempoQL simplifies the creation of cohorts for machine learning while maintaining precision, speed, and reproducibility.

Motivation: 当前AI在最优控制问题上的方法主要基于强化学习或在线学习，但这些框架与PAC学习在数学上存在差异。本文旨在将PAC学习框架扩展到非平稳环境中的学习和控制问题。

Method: 提出了"前瞻控制"框架，这是对前瞻学习的进一步扩展，用于处理非平稳环境中的学习和控制。证明了在一般假设下，经验风险最小化(ERM)能够渐近达到贝叶斯最优策略。

Conclusion: 前瞻控制框架为AI在非平稳环境中的最优控制问题提供了新的理论基础，并在实际任务中表现出显著优于传统强化学习方法的性能。

Abstract: Optimal control of the future is the next frontier for AI. Current approaches to this problem are typically rooted in either reinforcement learning or online learning. While powerful, these frameworks for learning are mathematically distinct from Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning, which has been the workhorse for the recent technological achievements in AI. We therefore build on the prior work of prospective learning, an extension of PAC learning (without control) in non-stationary environments (De Silva et al., 2023; Silva et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2026). Here, we further extend the PAC learning framework to address learning and control in non-stationary environments. Using this framework, called ''Prospective Control'', we prove that under certain fairly general assumptions, empirical risk minimization (ERM) asymptotically achieves the Bayes optimal policy. We then consider a specific instance of prospective control, foraging, which is a canonical task for any mobile agent, be it natural or artificial. We illustrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms fail to learn in these non-stationary environments, and even with modifications, they are orders of magnitude less efficient than our prospective foraging agents. Code is available at: https://github.com/neurodata/ProspectiveLearningwithControl.

Conclusion: BCOPS算法对训练数据中的噪声敏感，在实际应用中需要考虑数据质量对模型鲁棒性的影响。

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of adding noise to the training set classes in classification tasks using the BCOPS algorithm (Balanced and Conformal Optimized Prediction Sets), proposed by Guan & Tibshirani (2022). The BCOPS algorithm is an application of conformal prediction combined with a machine learning method to construct prediction sets such that the probability of the true class being included in the prediction set for a test observation meets a specified coverage guarantee. An observation is considered an outlier if its true class is not present in the training set. The study employs both synthetic and real datasets and conducts experiments to evaluate the prediction abstention rate for outlier observations and the model's robustness in this previously untested scenario. The results indicate that the addition of noise, even in small amounts, can have a significant effect on model performance.

Abstract: Active statistical inference is a new method for inference with AI-assisted data collection. Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling. Furthermore, with reliable uncertainty estimates, the estimator usually outperforms standard active inference. This is achieved by optimally interpolating between uniform and active sampling, depending on the quality of the uncertainty scores, and by using ideas from robust optimization. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a series of real datasets from computational social science and survey research.

Abstract: Self-consuming generative models have received significant attention over the last few years. In this paper, we study a self-consuming generative model with heterogeneous preferences that is a generalization of the model in Ferbach et al. (2024). The model is retrained round by round using real data and its previous-round synthetic outputs. The asymptotic behavior of the retraining dynamics is investigated across four regimes using different techniques including the nonlinear Perron--Frobenius theory. Our analyses improve upon that of Ferbach et al. (2024) and provide convergence results in settings where the well-known Banach contraction mapping arguments do not apply. Stability and non-stability results regarding the retraining dynamics are also given.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly central to scientific workflows, yet their systematic use and interpretation require a proper understanding of their limitations through rigorous validation. Classic approaches struggle with scalability, statistical power, or interpretability when applied to high-dimensional data, making it difficult to certify the reliability of these models in realistic, high-dimensional scientific settings. Here, we propose the use of the New Physics Learning Machine (NPLM), a learning based approach to goodness-of-fit testing inspired by the Neyman-Pearson construction, to test generative networks trained on high-dimensional scientific data. We demonstrate the performance of NPLM for validation in two benchmark cases: generative models trained on mixtures of Gaussian models with increasing dimensionality, and a public end-to-end generator for the Large Hadron Collider called FlashSim, trained on jet data, typical in the field of high-energy physics. We demonstrate that the NPLM can serve as a powerful validation method while also providing a means to diagnose sub-optimally modeled regions of the data.

Conclusion: Branching Flows提供了一个灵活的生成建模框架，能够处理元素数量不确定的生成任务，在多个领域展现出潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching approaches to generative modeling have shown promise in domains where the state space is continuous, such as image generation or protein folding & design, and discrete, exemplified by diffusion large language models. They offer a natural fit when the number of elements in a state is fixed in advance (e.g. images), but require ad hoc solutions when, for example, the length of a response from a large language model, or the number of amino acids in a protein chain is not known a priori.
  Here we propose Branching Flows, a generative modeling framework that, like diffusion and flow matching approaches, transports a simple distribution to the data distribution. But in Branching Flows, the elements in the state evolve over a forest of binary trees, branching and dying stochastically with rates that are learned by the model. This allows the model to control, during generation, the number of elements in the sequence. We also show that Branching Flows can compose with any flow matching base process on discrete sets, continuous Euclidean spaces, smooth manifolds, and `multimodal' product spaces that mix these components. We demonstrate this in three domains: small molecule generation (multimodal), antibody sequence generation (discrete), and protein backbone generation (multimodal), and show that Branching Flows is a capable distribution learner with a stable learning objective, and that it enables new capabilities.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental task in modern data science. Several projection methods specifically tailored to take into account the non-linearity of the data via local embeddings have been proposed. Such methods are often based on local neighbourhood structures and require tuning the number of neighbours that define this local structure, and the dimensionality of the lower-dimensional space onto which the data are projected. Such choices critically influence the quality of the resulting embedding. In this paper, we exploit a recently proposed intrinsic dimension estimator which also returns the optimal locally adaptive neighbourhood sizes according to some desirable criteria. In principle, this adaptive framework can be employed to perform an optimal hyper-parameter tuning of any dimensionality reduction algorithm that relies on local neighbourhood structures. Numerical experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show that the proposed method can be used to significantly improve well-known projection methods when employed for various learning tasks, with improvements measurable through both quantitative metrics and the quality of low-dimensional visualizations.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of denoising from noisy measurements where only the noise level is known, not the noise distribution. In multi-dimensions, independent noise $Z$ corrupts the signal $X$, resulting in the noisy measurement $Y = X + σZ$, where $σ\in (0, 1)$ is a known noise level. Our goal is to recover the underlying signal distribution $P_X$ from denoising $P_Y$. We propose and analyze universal denoisers that are agnostic to a wide range of signal and noise distributions. Our distributional denoisers offer order-of-magnitude improvements over the Bayes-optimal denoiser derived from Tweedie's formula, if the focus is on the entire distribution $P_X$ rather than on individual realizations of $X$. Our denoisers shrink $P_Y$ toward $P_X$ optimally, achieving $O(σ^4)$ and $O(σ^6)$ accuracy in matching generalized moments and density functions. Inspired by optimal transport theory, the proposed denoisers are optimal in approximating the Monge-Ampère equation with higher-order accuracy, and can be implemented efficiently via score matching.
  Let $q$ represent the density of $P_Y$; for optimal distributional denoising, we recommend replacing the Bayes-optimal denoiser, \[ \mathbf{T}^*(y) = y + σ^2 \nabla \log q(y), \] with denoisers exhibiting less aggressive distributional shrinkage, \[ \mathbf{T}_1(y) = y + \frac{σ^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y), \] \[ \mathbf{T}_2(y) = y + \frac{σ^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y) - \frac{σ^4}{8} \nabla \left( \frac{1}{2} \| \nabla \log q(y) \|^2 + \nabla \cdot \nabla \log q(y) \right) . \]

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子计算在机器学习和分类任务中具有巨大潜力，但量子模型输出的内在随机性需要在预测阶段重复执行，导致显著开销。

Method: 提出一种用于变分量子分类器的新型测量策略，定义无歧义量子分类器，在噪声环境中实现近乎确定的预测。

Result: 该方法在保持竞争力的分类准确度同时，显著减少了量子电路执行次数，尽管性能略有降低，但资源效率得到改善。

Conclusion: 该策略代表了在改进资源效率方面的有利权衡，理论模型得到了实验结果的验证。

Abstract: Quantum computing promises a revolution in information processing, with significant potential for machine learning and classification tasks. However, achieving this potential requires overcoming several fundamental challenges. One key limitation arises at the prediction stage, where the intrinsic randomness of quantum model outputs necessitates repeated executions, resulting in substantial overhead. To overcome this, we propose a novel measurement strategy for a variational quantum classifier that allows us to define the unambiguous quantum classifier. This strategy achieves near-deterministic predictions while maintaining competitive classification accuracy in noisy environments, all with significantly fewer quantum circuit executions. Although this approach entails a slight reduction in performance, it represents a favorable trade-off for improved resource efficiency. We further validate our theoretical model with supporting experimental results.

Conclusion: 论文提出的挑战解决模板为未来在mHealth试验中部署强化学习算法提供了实用指导，有助于更有效地促进行为改变。

Abstract: The ubiquitous nature of mobile health (mHealth) technology has expanded opportunities for the integration of reinforcement learning into traditional clinical trial designs, allowing researchers to learn individualized treatment policies during the study. LowSalt4Life 2 (LS4L2) is a recent trial aimed at reducing sodium intake among hypertensive individuals through an app-based intervention. A reinforcement learning algorithm, which was deployed in one of the trial arms, was designed to send reminder notifications to promote app engagement in contexts where the notification would be effective, i.e., when a participant is likely to open the app in the next 30-minute and not when prior data suggested reduced effectiveness. Such an algorithm can improve app-based mHealth interventions by reducing participant burden and more effectively promoting behavior change. We encountered various challenges during the implementation of the learning algorithm, which we present as a template to solving challenges in future trials that deploy reinforcement learning algorithms. We provide template solutions based on LS4L2 for solving the key challenges of (i) defining a relevant reward, (ii) determining a meaningful timescale for optimization, (iii) specifying a robust statistical model that allows for automation, (iv) balancing model flexibility with computational cost, and (v) addressing missing values in gradually collected data.

Abstract: In this work, we extend deep learning-based numerical methods to fully coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) within a non-Markovian framework. Error estimates and convergence are provided. In contrast to the existing literature, our approach not only analyzes the non-Markovian framework but also addresses fully coupled settings, in which both the drift and diffusion coefficients of the forward process may be random and depend on the backward components $Y$ and $Z$. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical applicability of our framework by addressing utility maximization problems under rough volatility, which are solved numerically with the proposed deep learning-based methods.

Conclusion: 混沌是确保系统可发现性的关键因素，这要求重新评估纯数据驱动发现的基本假设，对于非混沌系统需要结合先验物理知识。

Abstract: The deep learning revolution has spurred a rise in advances of using AI in sciences. Within physical sciences the main focus has been on discovery of dynamical systems from observational data. Yet the reliability of learned surrogates and symbolic models is often undermined by the fundamental problem of non-uniqueness. The resulting models may fit the available data perfectly, but lack genuine predictive power. This raises the question: under what conditions can the systems governing equations be uniquely identified from a finite set of observations? We show, counter-intuitively, that chaos, typically associated with unpredictability, is crucial for ensuring a system is discoverable in the space of continuous or analytic functions. The prevalence of chaotic systems in benchmark datasets may have inadvertently obscured this fundamental limitation.
  More concretely, we show that systems chaotic on their entire domain are discoverable from a single trajectory within the space of continuous functions, and systems chaotic on a strange attractor are analytically discoverable under a geometric condition on the attractor. As a consequence, we demonstrate for the first time that the classical Lorenz system is analytically discoverable. Moreover, we establish that analytic discoverability is impossible in the presence of first integrals, common in real-world systems. These findings help explain the success of data-driven methods in inherently chaotic domains like weather forecasting, while revealing a significant challenge for engineering applications like digital twins, where stable, predictable behavior is desired. For these non-chaotic systems, we find that while trajectory data alone is insufficient, certain prior physical knowledge can help ensure discoverability. These findings warrant a critical re-evaluation of the fundamental assumptions underpinning purely data-driven discovery.

*Encheng Xie,Yihang Sun,Tao Feng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMTRouter是一个基于异构图学习的个性化LLM路由框架，通过四类节点（用户、LLM、查询、响应）表示多轮交互，利用消息传递机制从少量数据中学习用户偏好，实现高效个性化路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法缺乏完全个性化，难以捕捉用户与LLM之间的复杂交互关系，且用户偏好数据通常稀缺、噪声大、格式不一致，限制了仅依赖用户特定数据的方法效果。

Method: 将多轮用户-LLM交互建模为异构图，包含用户、LLM、查询和响应四类节点，通过定制化的消息传递机制在轻量级归纳图学习框架中从少量数据学习用户偏好。

Result: 在多个数据集上，GMTRouter持续优于强基线，准确率提高0.9%到21.6%，AUC提高0.006到0.309。更重要的是，仅需少量数据即可适应新用户和演化偏好，无需大量微调。

Conclusion: GMTRouter通过异构图表示和消息传递机制有效解决了LLM路由中的个性化挑战，能够从少量数据中学习用户偏好，实现高效且适应性强的个性化路由。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs领域专业化微调中资源消耗大和灾难性遗忘导致通用能力下降的问题。

Method: 通过初步训练阶段的梯度分析，设计基于梯度大小和统计分布的自引导准则，优先选择对模型学习贡献最大的训练样本。

Result: 在医学、法律、金融等多个领域实验中，使用仅5%的GrADS选择数据就能超越全数据微调性能，使用50%数据时性能显著提升，同时大幅缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: GrADS方法在LLMs领域专业化微调中具有显著的高效性和成本效益，能够用少量数据获得更好的性能并保持模型通用能力。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Motivation: 自杀是青少年第二大死因，过去自杀企图是未来自杀的重要预测因素。许多有自杀想法的人会在社交媒体上发出信号，需要有效识别这些信号。

Method: 结合CNN架构和BiGRU技术的混合深度学习方案，集成CNN局部特征提取、BiGRU双向序列建模、注意力机制和SHAP可解释性。

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

Motivation: LLM在自然语言解释和推理方面表现良好，但其固有的随机性限制了在金融、医疗等受严格政策监管的行业中的应用。

Method: 两阶段神经符号框架：1) 使用LLM（可选人工指导）将自然语言政策形式化；2) 推理时自动形式化验证自然语言语句的逻辑正确性，必要时进行多重冗余形式化步骤进行交叉检查。

Conclusion: 该方法产生可审计的逻辑工件，能够验证结果并可用于改进原始文本，为受监管行业提供可靠的逻辑验证解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

TL;DR: LoopTool是一个完全自动化的模型感知数据进化框架，通过紧密集成数据合成和模型训练来改进LLM的工具学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具学习受到静态合成数据管道的限制，数据生成和模型训练是分离的非交互过程，无法自适应关注模型的具体弱点，且允许噪声标签持续存在，降低了训练效率。

Method: LoopTool通过三个协同模块迭代优化数据和模型：贪婪能力探测诊断模型掌握和失败的能力；判断引导标签验证使用开源判断模型查找并纠正标注错误；错误驱动数据扩展基于识别出的失败生成新的挑战性样本。

Result: 实验显示，使用LoopTool训练的8B模型显著超越了其32B数据生成器，并在BFCL-v3和ACEBench基准测试中达到了其规模的最新最先进结果。

Conclusion: 闭环自精炼数据管道可以显著增强LLM的工具使用能力，在成本效益高的开源生态系统中运行，消除了对昂贵闭源API的依赖。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法使用固定删除率处理变长序列输入（如自然语言句子）导致性能不佳，需要适应不同输入特性的动态删除机制。

Method: 引入AdaptDel方法，使用可适应删除率根据输入属性动态调整，并将随机平滑理论框架扩展到可变率删除，确保编辑距离下的可靠认证。

Result: 在自然语言任务中取得强实证结果，认证区域的中位数基数相比最先进认证方法提升了高达30个数量级。

Conclusion: AdaptDel方法通过动态删除率机制显著提升了序列分类在编辑距离扰动下的认证鲁棒性性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

Method: 构建MicroEvoEval基准测试，评估14个领域专用和通用架构模型，在四个代表性任务上进行短期和长期评估，采用多维度评估框架包括数值精度、计算成本和结构保持指标。

Result: 现代架构（如VMamba）不仅实现了优越的长期稳定性和物理保真度，而且计算效率提高了数量级。

Conclusion: 研究强调了全面评估的必要性，并确定现代架构是开发高效可靠替代模型的有前景方向。

Abstract: Simulating microstructure evolution (MicroEvo) is vital for materials design but demands high numerical accuracy, efficiency, and physical fidelity. Although recent studies on deep learning (DL) offer a promising alternative to traditional solvers, the field lacks standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are flawed due to a lack of comparing specialized MicroEvo DL models with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal architectures, an overemphasis on numerical accuracy over physical fidelity, and a failure to analyze error propagation over time. To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights. Notably, we find that modern architectures (e.g., VMamba), not only achieve superior long-term stability and physical fidelity but also operate with an order-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency. The results highlight the necessity of holistic evaluation and identify these modern architectures as a highly promising direction for developing efficient and reliable surrogate models in data-driven materials science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型ANN模型在蛋白质-RNA结合预测等任务中表现出色，但需要大量计算资源和数据，而生命科学数据通常有限且资源受限，因此探索小型ANN模型是否也能达到可接受的准确性。

Method: 使用浅层前馈神经网络（两个隐藏层），采用滑动窗口方法隐式考虑邻近残基和碱基的上下文，不利用显式结构信息。尝试不同非线性激活函数和训练技术处理数据不平衡问题。

Result: 只有ReLU、GLU和Tanh三种非线性函数能产生收敛模型；过采样和欠采样等重平衡技术无效，但增加训练数据量和使用模型集成能显著提升性能；最佳上下文窗口大小为约30个残基和碱基。

Conclusion: 使用大多数教育和研究机构可获得的计算硬件，可以实现高精度的蛋白质-RNA结合预测，小型ANN模型在此任务中具有可行性。

Abstract: Large Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models have demonstrated success in various domains, including general text and image generation, drug discovery, and protein-RNA (ribonucleic acid) binding tasks. However, these models typically demand substantial computational resources, time, and data for effective training. Given that such extensive resources are often inaccessible to many researchers and that life sciences data sets are frequently limited, we investigated whether small ANN models could achieve acceptable accuracy in protein-RNA prediction. We experimented with shallow feed-forward ANNs comprising two hidden layers and various non-linearities. These models did not utilize explicit structural information; instead, a sliding window approach was employed to implicitly consider the context of neighboring residues and bases. We explored different training techniques to address the issue of highly unbalanced data. Among the seven most popular non-linearities for feed-forward ANNs, only three: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Gated Linear Unit (GLU), and Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh) yielded converging models. Common re-balancing techniques, such as under- and over-sampling of training sets, proved ineffective, whereas increasing the volume of training data and using model ensembles significantly improved performance. The optimal context window size, balancing both false negative and false positive errors, was found to be approximately 30 residues and bases. Our findings indicate that high-accuracy protein-RNA binding prediction is achievable using computing hardware accessible to most educational and research institutions.

### [159] [MCAD: Multimodal Context-Aware Audio Description Generation For Soccer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09448)
*Lipisha Chaudhary,Trisha Mittal,Subhadra Gopalakrishnan,Ifeoma Nwogu,Jaclyn Pytlarz*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端的音频描述生成系统MCAD，将AD生成从电影扩展到体育领域（特别是足球比赛），无需依赖真实AD标注，并引入了新的评估指标ARGE-AD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动AD生成方法局限于高质量电影内容且需要人工标注的真实AD，需要扩展AD生成到更广泛的领域如体育，并解决缺乏领域特定AD数据集的问题。

Method: 在公开电影AD数据集上微调视频大语言模型学习AD的叙述结构和惯例，在推理时结合多模态上下文线索（球员身份、足球事件和动作、评论）来生成完整的AD文本。

Result: 在电影和足球数据集上进行了深入分析，验证了ARGE-AD指标在跨领域评估生成AD质量的有效性，并贡献了100个足球比赛片段的专家标注AD。

Conclusion: MCAD系统成功将AD生成扩展到体育领域，ARGE-AD指标能有效评估生成AD质量，为视觉障碍人士提供了更广泛的可访问内容。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (AD) are essential for making visual content accessible to individuals with visual impairments. Recent works have shown a promising step towards automating AD, but they have been limited to describing high-quality movie content using human-annotated ground truth AD in the process. In this work, we present an end-to-end pipeline, MCAD, that extends AD generation beyond movies to the domain of sports, with a focus on soccer games, without relying on ground truth AD. To address the absence of domain-specific AD datasets, we fine-tune a Video Large Language Model on publicly available movie AD datasets so that it learns the narrative structure and conventions of AD. During inference, MCAD incorporates multimodal contextual cues such as player identities, soccer events and actions, and commentary from the game. These cues, combined with input prompts to the fine-tuned VideoLLM, allow the system to produce complete AD text for each video segment. We further introduce a new evaluation metric, ARGE-AD, designed to accurately assess the quality of generated AD. ARGE-AD evaluates the generated AD for the presence of five characteristics: (i) usage of people's names, (ii) mention of actions and events, (iii) appropriate length of AD, (iv) absence of pronouns, and (v) overlap from commentary or subtitles. We present an in-depth analysis of our approach on both movie and soccer datasets. We also validate the use of this metric to quantitatively comment on the quality of generated AD using our metric across domains. Additionally, we contribute audio descriptions for 100 soccer game clips annotated by two AD experts.

*ZhenZhong Wang,Xin Zhang,Jun Liao,Min Jiang*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 提出了Interface Information-Aware Neural Operator (IANO)框架，通过显式利用界面信息作为物理先验，提高多相流系统预测精度，在数据稀缺和噪声条件下保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多相流系统具有复杂动力学、场不连续性和相间相互作用，传统数值求解器面临计算挑战。神经算子虽然提供高效替代方案，但在多相流中难以实现高分辨率数值精度，主要由于空间异质性和高质量训练数据稀缺。

Method: IANO架构包含两个关键组件：1）界面感知多函数编码机制，联合建模多个物理场和界面，捕捉界面的高频物理特征；2）几何感知位置编码机制，建立界面信息、物理变量和空间位置的关系，实现点级超分辨率预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，IANO在多相流模拟中比基线方法准确率提高约10%，在数据稀缺和噪声扰动条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: IANO通过显式利用界面物理先验，有效解决了多相流中神经算子的精度限制问题，为复杂多相系统的高精度模拟提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multiphase flow systems, with their complex dynamics, field discontinuities, and interphase interactions, pose significant computational challenges for traditional numerical solvers. While neural operators offer efficient alternatives, they often struggle to achieve high-resolution numerical accuracy in these systems. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent spatial heterogeneity and the scarcity of high-quality training data in multiphase flows. In this work, we propose the Interface Information-Aware Neural Operator (IANO), a novel framework that explicitly leverages interface information as a physical prior to enhance the prediction accuracy. The IANO architecture introduces two key components: 1) An interface-aware multiple function encoding mechanism jointly models multiple physical fields and interfaces, thus capturing the high-frequency physical features at the interface. 2) A geometry-aware positional encoding mechanism further establishes the relationship between interface information, physical variables, and spatial positions, enabling it to achieve pointwise super-resolution prediction even in the low-data regimes. Experimental results demonstrate that IANO outperforms baselines by $\sim$10\% in accuracy for multiphase flow simulations while maintaining robustness under data-scarce and noise-perturbed conditions.

### [161] [Generalisable prediction model of surgical case duration: multicentre development and temporal validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08994)
*Daijiro Kabata,Mari Ito,Tokito Koga,Kazuma Yunoki*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 开发了一个仅使用广泛可得的术前变量的堆叠机器学习模型，用于预测手术时长，在时间外部验证中表现出良好的准确性和校准性，支持跨机构和跨时间的可移植性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手术时长预测模型通常依赖特定医院或外科医生的输入，且很少经过外部验证，限制了其通用性。需要开发更通用的预测工具来改善手术室调度。

Method: 采用回顾性多中心研究，使用日本两家综合医院的围手术期数据。包含四个机器学习算法（弹性网络、广义加性模型、随机森林、梯度提升树），通过内部-外部交叉验证进行调优，并使用堆叠泛化方法组合预测结果。

Result: 分析了63,206例手术，在2024年时间测试队列中校准良好（截距0.423，斜率0.921），在不同中心和年份间表现一致。

Conclusion: 仅使用广泛可得的术前变量的堆叠机器学习模型在时间外部验证中实现了准确、良好校准的预测，支持跨站点和跨时间的可移植性，这类通用工具可改善手术室调度而不依赖特殊输入。

Abstract: Background: Accurate prediction of surgical case duration underpins operating room (OR) scheduling, yet existing models often depend on site- or surgeon-specific inputs and rarely undergo external validation, limiting generalisability.
  Methods: We undertook a retrospective multicentre study using routinely collected perioperative data from two general hospitals in Japan (development: 1 January 2021-31 December 2023; temporal test: 1 January-31 December 2024). Elective weekday procedures with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status 1-4 were included. Pre-specified preoperative predictors comprised surgical context (year, month, weekday, scheduled duration, general anaesthesia indicator, body position) and patient factors (sex, age, body mass index, allergy, infection, comorbidity, ASA). Missing data were addressed by multiple imputation by chained equations. Four learners (elastic-net, generalised additive models, random forest, gradient-boosted trees) were tuned within internal-external cross-validation (IECV; leave-one-cluster-out by centre-year) and combined by stacked generalisation to predict log-transformed duration.
  Results: We analysed 63,206 procedures (development 45,647; temporal test 17,559). Cluster-specific and pooled errors and calibrations from IECV are provided with consistent performance across centres and years. In the 2024 temporal test cohort, calibration was good (intercept 0.423, 95%CI 0.372 to 0.474; slope 0.921, 95%CI 0.911 to 0.932).
  Conclusions: A stacked machine-learning model using only widely available preoperative variables achieved accurate, well-calibrated predictions in temporal external validation, supporting transportability across sites and over time. Such general-purpose tools may improve OR scheduling without relying on idiosyncratic inputs.

Motivation: 随着探测到的凌星系外行星候选体数量持续增长，需要稳健且可扩展的自动化工具来优先排序或验证这些候选体。深度学习模型能够解释传统验证过程中使用的复杂诊断指标。

Method: 使用Kepler Q1-Q17 DR25数据进行训练，采用10折交叉验证生成10个独立模型。通过标准化输入管道使模型可扩展到TESS数据。

Abstract: Context. As the number of detected transiting exoplanet candidates continues to grow, the need for robust and scalable automated tools to prioritize or validate them has become increasingly critical. Among the most promising solutions, deep learning models offer the ability to interpret complex diagnostic metrics traditionally used in the vetting process. Aims. In this work, we present WATSON-Net, a new open-source neural network classifier and data preparation package designed to compete with current state-of-the-art tools for vetting and validation of transiting exoplanet signals from space-based missions. Methods. Trained on Kepler Q1-Q17 DR25 data using 10-fold cross-validation, WATSON-Net produces ten independent models, each evaluated on dedicated validation and test sets. The ten models are calibrated and prepared to be extensible for TESS data by standardizing the input pipeline, allowing for performance assessment across different space missions. Results. For Kepler targets, WATSON-Net achieves a recall-at-precision of 0.99 (R@P0.99) of 0.903, ranking second, with only the ExoMiner network performing better (R@P0.99 = 0.936). For TESS signals, WATSON-Net emerges as the best-performing non-fine-tuned machine learning classifier, achieving a precision of 0.93 and a recall of 0.76 on a test set comprising confirmed planets and false positives. Both the model and its data preparation tools are publicly available in the dearwatson Python package, fully open-source and integrated into the vetting engine of the SHERLOCK pipeline.

Motivation: 全基因组测序发现了大量非编码短变异，但其功能影响仍不清楚。准确预测和优先排序基因调控区域中的临床相关突变仍然是一个主要挑战。

Method: 结合700个在ENCODE基因调控区域上训练的DNABERT微调模型，结合变异评分、motif分析、基于注意力的可视化和生存分析。

Result: 在TCGA胶质母细胞瘤数据中识别了572个剪接破坏和9,837个转录因子结合位点改变突变；生存分析将1,352个突变和563个破坏的调控区域与患者预后联系起来。

Abstract: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has revealed numerous non-coding short variants whose functional impacts remain poorly understood. Despite recent advances in deep-learning genomic approaches, accurately predicting and prioritizing clinically relevant mutations in gene regulatory regions remains a major challenge. Here we introduce Deep VRegulome, a deep-learning method for prediction and interpretation of functionally disruptive variants in the human regulome, which combines 700 DNABERT fine-tuned models, trained on vast amounts of ENCODE gene regulatory regions, with variant scoring, motif analysis, attention-based visualization, and survival analysis. We showcase its application on TCGA glioblastoma WGS dataset in prioritizing survival-associated mutations and regulatory regions. The analysis identified 572 splice-disrupting and 9,837 transcription-factor binding site altering mutations occurring in greater than 10% of glioblastoma samples. Survival analysis linked 1352 mutations and 563 disrupted regulatory regions to patient outcomes, enabling stratification via non-coding mutation signatures. All the code, fine-tuned models, and an interactive data portal are publicly available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文改进了现有的图稀疏化算法MAC，通过开发专用求解器、优化步长策略和自动连通性保证方案，使其更适合实时估计应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的图估计方法在大规模长期图上扩展性差，MAC算法虽然能通过最大化代数连通性来保持估计性能，但计算成本高且需要手动指定连通边集，限制了其在线使用。

Method: 开发了专用代数连通性求解器（平均提速2倍）、研究了MAC优化程序的高级步长策略、提出了自动保证图连通性的方案。

Result: 这些改进使MAC算法更具可扩展性、可靠性和实时适用性。

Conclusion: 通过三方面的互补改进，MAC算法现在更适合实时估计应用，解决了原有算法的计算瓶颈和手动配置问题。

Abstract: Long-term state estimation over graphs remains challenging as current graph estimation methods scale poorly on large, long-term graphs. To address this, our work advances a current state-of-the-art graph sparsification algorithm, maximizing algebraic connectivity (MAC). MAC is a sparsification method that preserves estimation performance by maximizing the algebraic connectivity, a spectral graph property that is directly connected to the estimation error. Unfortunately, MAC remains computationally prohibitive for online use and requires users to manually pre-specify a connectivity-preserving edge set. Our contributions close these gaps along three complementary fronts: we develop a specialized solver for algebraic connectivity that yields an average 2x runtime speedup; we investigate advanced step size strategies for MAC's optimization procedure to enhance both convergence speed and solution quality; and we propose automatic schemes that guarantee graph connectivity without requiring manual specification of edges. Together, these contributions make MAC more scalable, reliable, and suitable for real-time estimation applications.

Conclusion: 论文强调了向更自适应、更易访问的人机协同合作发展的趋势和有前景的方向，为实现真正的人机协同合作提供了系统性的分析框架。

Abstract: Remarkable capabilities have been achieved by robotics and AI, mastering complex tasks and environments. Yet, humans often remain passive observers, fascinated but uncertain how to engage. Robots, in turn, cannot reach their full potential in human-populated environments without effectively modeling human states and intentions and adapting their behavior. To achieve a synergistic human-robot collaboration (HRC), a continuous information flow should be established: humans must intuitively communicate instructions, share expertise, and express needs. In parallel, robots must clearly convey their internal state and forthcoming actions to keep users informed, comfortable, and in control. This review identifies and connects key components enabling intuitive information exchange and skill transfer between humans and robots. We examine the full interaction pipeline: from the human-to-robot communication bridge translating multimodal inputs into robot-understandable representations, through adaptive planning and role allocation, to the control layer and feedback mechanisms to close the loop. Finally, we highlight trends and promising directions toward more adaptive, accessible HRC.

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将语义理解与几何精度相结合，实现了无需手动训练数据的高性能语义抓取。

Abstract: Large Vision Models trained on internet-scale data have demonstrated strong capabilities in segmenting and semantically understanding object parts, even in cluttered, crowded scenes. However, while these models can direct a robot toward the general region of an object, they lack the geometric understanding required to precisely control dexterous robotic hands for 3D grasping. To overcome this, our key insight is to leverage simulation with a force-closure grasping generation pipeline that understands local geometries of the hand and object in the scene. Because this pipeline is slow and requires ground-truth observations, the resulting data is distilled into a diffusion model that operates in real-time on camera point clouds. By combining the global semantic understanding of internet-scale models with the geometric precision of a simulation-based locally-aware force-closure, \our achieves high-performance semantic grasping without any manually collected training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在公共道路上部署时会面临各种驾驶危险，需要具备持续监控危险和自适应响应安全违规的能力，以在复杂驾驶场景中保持稳健的驾驶行为。

Method: Argus框架持续监控ADS生成的轨迹，当EGO车辆被认为不安全时，通过危险缓解器无缝接管控制。该框架与TCP、UniAD和VAD三种最先进的端到端ADS集成。

Result: 评估表明Argus有效提升了ADS的韧性，平均驾驶分数提高了150.30%，防止了64.38%的违规行为，且时间开销很小。

Conclusion: Argus框架能够显著增强端到端自动驾驶系统的安全性和韧性，在防止安全违规和提升驾驶性能方面表现出色。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Conclusion: 这是首个将VSA应用于ARC-AGI的方法，开发了迄今为止最认知合理的ARC-AGI求解器，代码已开源。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI训练方法只在模型核心能力建立后才进行价值观对齐，导致模型容易被误导且缺乏深层次价值体系。在大模型能力开始超越人类的背景下，需要从根本上改变训练方式

Method: 重新设计训练语料库：采用第一人称视角重构训练数据、将信息重新情境化为生活经验、模拟社会互动、对训练数据进行有序搭建

Result: 预期这种训练语料库重构将实现从第一个训练标记开始的早期价值观承诺，使知识、技能和价值观内在难以分离

Conclusion: 在大型语言模型能力开始超越人类能力的生态系统中，这种从"训练"到"培养"的范式转变是至关重要的需求

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

Conclusion: LLM在规划任务上相比前代模型有显著改进，缩小了与专业规划器在挑战性基准上的性能差距。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI安全方法依赖检查模型输出或激活，但某些风险仅通过检查无法检测。需要一种架构无关的补充方法来增强安全性。

Method: 使用共识采样算法，给定k个模型和提示，实现与最安全的s个模型平均风险相当的风险水平，当模型间缺乏足够共识时选择弃权。算法利用模型计算输出概率的能力。

Result: 当足够多的模型安全且表现出足够一致性时，可以限制弃权概率。算法从Vyas等人的可证明版权保护算法中获得启发。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种新的模型无关的AI安全方法，通过从集合中未知的安全模型子集放大安全保证，形成一个可靠的单一模型。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

### [172] [A Finite Difference Approximation of Second Order Regularization of Neural-SDFs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08980)
*Haotian Yin,Aleksander Plocharski,Michal Jan Wlodarczyk,Przemyslaw Musialski*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于神经SDF学习中曲率正则化的有限差分框架，替代计算昂贵的二阶自动微分，通过轻量级有限差分模板近似二阶导数，在保持重建质量的同时显著降低GPU内存使用和训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用二阶自动微分来强制曲率先验，虽然准确但计算成本高昂。其他方法通过避免显式Hessian组装减少了开销，但仍需要高阶微分。需要一种更高效且可扩展的曲率正则化方法。

Method: 使用基于泰勒展开的轻量级有限差分模板来近似二阶导数，截断误差为O(h^2)，可作为高斯曲率和秩不足损失的即插即用替代方案。

Result: 实验表明有限差分变体实现了与自动微分对应方法相当的重建保真度，同时将GPU内存使用和训练时间减少了最多两倍。在稀疏、不完整和非CAD数据上的额外测试证实了该方法的鲁棒性和通用性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法为曲率感知SDF学习提供了一种高效且可扩展的替代方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: We introduce a finite-difference framework for curvature regularization in neural signed distance field (SDF) learning. Existing approaches enforce curvature priors using full Hessian information obtained via second-order automatic differentiation, which is accurate but computationally expensive. Others reduced this overhead by avoiding explicit Hessian assembly, but still required higher-order differentiation. In contrast, our method replaces these operations with lightweight finite-difference stencils that approximate second derivatives using the well known Taylor expansion with a truncation error of O(h^2), and can serve as drop-in replacements for Gaussian curvature and rank-deficiency losses. Experiments demonstrate that our finite-difference variants achieve reconstruction fidelity comparable to their automatic-differentiation counterparts, while reducing GPU memory usage and training time by up to a factor of two. Additional tests on sparse, incomplete, and non-CAD data confirm that the proposed formulation is robust and general, offering an efficient and scalable alternative for curvature-aware SDF learning.

*Aleksandr Mazur,Roman Sharypov,Andrey Shirokov*

Main category: nucl-th

TL;DR: 使用神经网络集成方法将无核壳模型(NCSM)结果外推到无限模型空间，用于轻核的能量和半径计算。该方法能获得收敛预测并量化不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NCSM在有限模型空间中计算轻核性质时，需要外推到无限模型空间以获得精确结果的问题。

Method: 采用神经网络集成方法，基于Daejeon16 NN相互作用在不同模型空间和不同ℏΩ参数下的NCSM结果进行外推。

Result: 基态能量与实验值相差几百keV，束缚态半径收敛良好，但非束缚态半径不稳定。

Conclusion: 神经网络集成方法能有效外推NCSM结果，对束缚态性质预测准确，但对非束缚态半径预测存在困难。

Abstract: An ensemble of neural networks is employed to extrapolate no-core shell model (NCSM) results to infinite model space for light nuclei. We present a review of our neural network extrapolations of the NCSM results obtained with the Daejeon16 NN interaction in different model spaces and with different values of the NCSM basis parameter $\hbarΩ$ for energies of nuclear states and root-mean-square (rms) radii of proton, neutron and matter distributions in light nuclei. The method yields convergent predictions with quantifiable uncertainties. Ground-state energies for $^{6}$Li, $^{6}$He, and the unbound $^{6}$Be, as well as the excited $(3^{+},0)$ and $(0^{+},1)$ states of $^{6}$Li, are obtained within a few hundred keV of experiment. The extrapolated radii of bound states converge well. In contrast, radii of unbound states in $^{6}$Be and $^{6}$Li do not stabilize.

TL;DR: 首次将联邦学习应用于美国国家金融能力研究，开发了一个可解释的框架来预测消费者财务困境，无需集中敏感数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在保护敏感数据隐私的同时，在全国范围内预测消费者财务困境的需求，特别是在金融监管严格的背景下。

Method: 采用跨孤岛联邦学习设置，将每个州视为独立数据孤岛，结合两种互补的可解释AI技术识别全局和局部预测因子，开发适用于高度分类不平衡调查数据的机器学习模型。

Result: 成功开发了一个可扩展、符合监管要求的金融预警系统蓝图，能够识别债务催收机构联系等财务困境预测因子。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了联邦学习如何在消费者信用风险和金融包容性领域推动社会责任的AI应用，为金融系统提供了实用的早期预警解决方案。

Abstract: We present the first application of federated learning (FL) to the U.S. National Financial Capability Study, introducing an interpretable framework for predicting consumer financial distress across all 50 states and the District of Columbia without centralizing sensitive data. Our cross-silo FL setup treats each state as a distinct data silo, simulating real-world governance in nationwide financial systems. Unlike prior work, our approach integrates two complementary explainable AI techniques to identify both global (nationwide) and local (state-specific) predictors of financial hardship, such as contact from debt collection agencies. We develop a machine learning model specifically suited for highly categorical, imbalanced survey data. This work delivers a scalable, regulation-compliant blueprint for early warning systems in finance, demonstrating how FL can power socially responsible AI applications in consumer credit risk and financial inclusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型主要分析文本报告而非历史价格数据（技术分析），且需要在时间序列域和自然语言域之间切换，这是一个具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 将股票价格数据转换为文本注释，使用逆均方误差奖励目标优化推理轨迹，并将时间序列骨干模型的输出基于推理属性进行条件化。

Result: 在美国、中国和欧洲市场的股票数据集上，VTA实现了最先进的预测精度，且推理轨迹在行业专家评估中表现良好。

Conclusion: VTA框架成功解决了跨域推理的挑战，既提高了预测准确性，又提供了可解释的推理过程。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have been used to produce interpretable stock forecasts, they mainly focus on analyzing textual reports but not historical price data, also known as Technical Analysis. This task is challenging as it switches between domains: the stock price inputs and outputs lie in the time-series domain, while the reasoning step should be in natural language. In this work, we introduce Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA), a novel framework that combine verbal and latent reasoning to produce stock time-series forecasts that are both accurate and interpretable. To reason over time-series, we convert stock price data into textual annotations and optimize the reasoning trace using an inverse Mean Squared Error (MSE) reward objective. To produce time-series outputs from textual reasoning, we condition the outputs of a time-series backbone model on the reasoning-based attributes. Experiments on stock datasets across U.S., Chinese, and European markets show that VTA achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, while the reasoning traces also perform well on evaluation by industry experts.

<details>

Motivation: 金融时间序列模式受短期公众意见和中长期政策市场趋势影响，需要处理多周期输入以获得准确预测，但现有模型要么只用单周期输入，要么缺乏针对多周期特性的定制设计

Method: 设计三个新模块：周期间冗余过滤(IRF)去除周期间信息冗余，可学习加权平均集成(LWI)有效集成多周期预测，多周期自适应分块(MAP)通过设置相同分块数来减轻对特定周期的偏向；还提出分块压缩模块来提高自注意力建模效率

Result: MLF通过整合不同长度的多周期输入实现更好的准确性，并减少训练时选择输入长度的成本

Conclusion: 该框架在考虑准确性和效率要求的同时，有效处理了金融时间序列预测中的多周期特性问题

Abstract: Time series forecasting is important in finance domain. Financial time series (TS) patterns are influenced by both short-term public opinions and medium-/long-term policy and market trends. Hence, processing multi-period inputs becomes crucial for accurate financial time series forecasting (TSF). However, current TSF models either use only single-period input, or lack customized designs for addressing multi-period characteristics. In this paper, we propose a Multi-period Learning Framework (MLF) to enhance financial TSF performance. MLF considers both TSF's accuracy and efficiency requirements. Specifically, we design three new modules to better integrate the multi-period inputs for improving accuracy: (i) Inter-period Redundancy Filtering (IRF), that removes the information redundancy between periods for accurate self-attention modeling, (ii) Learnable Weighted-average Integration (LWI), that effectively integrates multi-period forecasts, (iii) Multi-period self-Adaptive Patching (MAP), that mitigates the bias towards certain periods by setting the same number of patches across all periods. Furthermore, we propose a Patch Squeeze module to reduce the number of patches in self-attention modeling for maximized efficiency. MLF incorporates multiple inputs with varying lengths (periods) to achieve better accuracy and reduces the costs of selecting input lengths during training. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Meteor-Stars/MLF.

Abstract: We investigate a number of Artificial Neural Network architectures (well-known and more ``exotic'') in application to the long-term financial time-series forecasts of indexes on different global markets. The particular area of interest of this research is to examine the correlation of these indexes' behaviour in terms of Machine Learning algorithms cross-training. Would training an algorithm on an index from one global market produce similar or even better accuracy when such a model is applied for predicting another index from a different market? The demonstrated predominately positive answer to this question is another argument in favour of the long-debated Efficient Market Hypothesis of Eugene Fama.

Abstract: The Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother are optimal for state estimation in linear dynamic systems. With nonlinear systems, the challenge consists in how to propagate uncertainty through the state transitions and output function. For the case of a neural network model, we enable accurate uncertainty propagation using a recent state-of-the-art analytic formula for computing the mean and covariance of a deep neural network with Gaussian input. We argue that cross entropy is a more appropriate performance metric than RMSE for evaluating the accuracy of filters and smoothers. We demonstrate the superiority of our method for state estimation on a stochastic Lorenz system and a Wiener system, and find that our method enables more optimal linear quadratic regulation when the state estimate is used for feedback.

Conclusion: 该双分解框架为嵌入神经网络的混合整数规划提供了可扩展、模块化且适应性强的解决方案，显著提升了求解效率。

Abstract: Embedding deep neural networks (NNs) into mixed-integer programs (MIPs) is attractive for decision making with learned constraints, yet state-of-the-art monolithic linearisations blow up in size and quickly become intractable. In this paper, we introduce a novel dual-decomposition framework that relaxes the single coupling equality u=x with an augmented Lagrange multiplier and splits the problem into a vanilla MIP and a constrained NN block. Each part is tackled by the solver that suits it best-branch and cut for the MIP subproblem, first-order optimisation for the NN subproblem-so the model remains modular, the number of integer variables never grows with network depth, and the per-iteration cost scales only linearly with the NN size. On the public \textsc{SurrogateLIB} benchmark, our method proves \textbf{scalable}, \textbf{modular}, and \textbf{adaptable}: it runs \(120\times\) faster than an exact Big-M formulation on the largest test case; the NN sub-solver can be swapped from a log-barrier interior step to a projected-gradient routine with no code changes and identical objective value; and swapping the MLP for an LSTM backbone still completes the full optimisation in 47s without any bespoke adaptation.

Conclusion: 该几何鲁棒最小二乘方法通过流形不确定性建模，提供了透明几何解释的高效算法，在鲁棒控制应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The paper studies a geometrically robust least-squares problem that extends classical and norm-based robust formulations. Rather than minimizing residual error for fixed or perturbed data, we interpret least-squares as enforcing approximate subspace inclusion between measured and true data spaces. The uncertainty in this geometric relation is modeled as a metric ball on the Grassmannian manifold, leading to a min-max problem over Euclidean and manifold variables. The inner maximization admits a closed-form solution, enabling an efficient algorithm with a transparent geometric interpretation. Applied to robust finite-horizon linear-quadratic tracking in data-enabled predictive control, the method improves upon existing robust least-squares formulations, achieving stronger robustness and favorable scaling under small uncertainty.

Abstract: We propose an optimization model where a parking lot manager (PLM) can aggregate parked EV batteries to provide virtual energy storage services that are provably robust under uncertain EV departures and state-of-charge caps. Our formulation yields a data-driven convex optimization problem where a prosumer community agrees on a contract with the PLM for the provision of storage services over a finite horizon. Leveraging recent results in the scenario approach, we certify out-of-sample constraint safety. Furthermore, we enable a tunable profit-risk trade-off through scenario relaxation and extend our model to account for robustness to adversarial perturbations and distributional shifts over Wasserstein-based ambiguity sets. All the approaches are accompanied by tight finite-sample certificates. Numerical studies demonstrate the out-of-sample and out-of-distribution constraint satisfaction of our proposed model compared to the developed theoretical guarantees, showing their effectiveness and potential in robust and efficient virtual energy services.

Abstract: In spatially embedded networks such as transportation and power grids, understanding how edge removals affect connectivity is crucial for robustness analysis. This paper studies a planar graph dismantling problem under an edge-budget constraint. We propose a spanning-tree-skeleton dual-path framework that first samples multiple uniform spanning trees to capture network backbones and then adaptively selects between two complementary paths according to the budget. The small-budget path estimates a dismantlable subgraph fraction using a logarithmic density feature, while the large-budget path predicts the optimal partition count through a slope-based model. Experiments on random planar graphs demonstrate near-linear runtime scaling, consistent reductions in the largest connected component ratio, and clear budget-fragmentation trends. The method provides an interpretable and efficient approach for planar-network robustness analysis.

Abstract: We propose a novel neural preconditioned Newton (NP-Newton) method for solving parametric nonlinear systems of equations. To overcome the stagnation or instability of Newton iterations caused by unbalanced nonlinearities, we introduce a fixed-point neural operator (FPNO) that learns the direct mapping from the current iterate to the solution by emulating fixed-point iterations. Unlike traditional line-search or trust-region algorithms, the proposed FPNO adaptively employs negative step sizes to effectively mitigate the effects of unbalanced nonlinearities. Through numerical experiments we demonstrate the computational efficiency and robustness of the proposed NP-Newton method across multiple real-world applications, especially for very strong nonlinearities.

Abstract: Smart contracts concentrate high value assets and complex logic in small, immutable programs, where even minor bugs can cause major losses. Existing taxonomies and tools remain fragmented, organized around symptoms such as reentrancy rather than structural causes. This paper introduces an attack-centric, program-structure taxonomy that unifies Solidity vulnerabilities into eight root-cause families covering control flow, external calls, state integrity, arithmetic safety, environmental dependencies, access control, input validation, and cross-domain protocol assumptions. Each family is illustrated through concise Solidity examples, exploit mechanics, and mitigations, and linked to the detection signals observable by static, dynamic, and learning-based tools. We further cross-map legacy datasets (SmartBugs, SolidiFI) to this taxonomy to reveal label drift and coverage gaps. The taxonomy provides a consistent vocabulary and practical checklist that enable more interpretable detection, reproducible audits, and structured security education for both researchers and practitioners.

However, lacking checks on signature usage conditions can lead to repeated verifications, increasing the risk of permission abuse and threatening contract assets. We define this issue as the Signature Replay Vulnerability (SRV). In this paper, we conducted the first empirical study to investigate the causes and characteristics of the SRVs. From 1,419 audit reports across 37 blockchain security companies, we identified 108 with detailed SRV descriptions and classified five types of SRVs. To detect these vulnerabilities automatically, we designed LASiR, which utilizes the general semantic understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in the static taint analysis of the signature state and identify the signature reuse behavior. It also employs path reachability verification via symbolic execution to ensure effective and reliable detection. To evaluate the performance of LASiR, we conducted large-scale experiments on 15,383 contracts involving signature verification, selected from the initial dataset of 918,964 contracts across four blockchains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The results indicate that SRVs are widespread, with affected contracts holding $4.76 million in active assets. Among these, 19.63% of contracts that use signatures on Ethereum contain SRVs. Furthermore, manual verification demonstrates that LASiR achieves an F1-score of 87.90% for detection. Ablation studies and comparative experiments reveal that the semantic information provided by LLMs aids static taint analysis, significantly enhancing LASiR's detection performance.

Abstract: Industrial Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) often comprise hundreds of thousands to millions of nets and millions to tens of millions of connectivity edges, making empirical evaluation of hardware-Trojan (HT) detectors on realistic designs both necessary and difficult. Public benchmarks remain significantly smaller and hand-crafted, while releasing truly malicious RTL raises ethical and operational risks. This work presents an automated and scalable methodology for generating HT-like patterns in industry-scale netlists whose purpose is to stress-test detection tools without altering user-visible functionality. The pipeline (i) parses large gate-level designs into connectivity graphs, (ii) explores rare regions using SCOAP testability metrics, and (iii) applies parameterized, function-preserving graph transformations to synthesize trigger-payload pairs that mimic the statistical footprint of stealthy HTs. When evaluated on the benchmarks generated in this work, representative state-of-the-art graph-learning models fail to detect Trojans. The framework closes the evaluation gap between academic circuits and modern SoCs by providing reproducible challenge instances that advance security research without sharing step-by-step attack instructions.

Abstract: Model watermarking techniques can embed watermark information into the protected model for ownership declaration by constructing specific input-output pairs. However, existing watermarks are easily removed when facing model stealing attacks, and make it difficult for model owners to effectively verify the copyright of stolen models. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of the failure of current watermarking methods under model stealing scenarios and then explore potential solutions. Specifically, we introduce a robust watermarking framework, DeepTracer, which leverages a novel watermark samples construction method and a same-class coupling loss constraint. DeepTracer can incur a high-coupling model between watermark task and primary task that makes adversaries inevitably learn the hidden watermark task when stealing the primary task functionality. Furthermore, we propose an effective watermark samples filtering mechanism that elaborately select watermark key samples used in model ownership verification to enhance the reliability of watermarks. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and models demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in defending against various model stealing attacks, as well as watermark attacks, and achieves new state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness.
