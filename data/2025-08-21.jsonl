For analysis and visualization, topological primitives such as\ncontour trees can be used, but these often need simplification to filter out\nsmall-scale features. For parcel-based convective cloud simulations,\nsimplification of the contour tree requires a volumetric measure rather than\npersistence. Unlike for cubic meshes, volume cannot be approximated by counting\nregular vertices. Typically, this is addressed by resampling irregular data\nonto a uniform grid. Unfortunately, the spatial proximity of parcels requires a\nhigh sampling frequency, resulting in a massive increase in data size for\nprocessing. We therefore extend volume-based contour tree simplification to\nparcel-in-cell simulations with a graph adaptor in Viskores (VTK-m), using\nDelaunay tetrahedralization of the parcel centroids as input. Instead of\nrelying on a volume approximation by counting regular vertices -- as was done\nfor cubic meshes -- we adapt the 2D area splines reported by Bajaj et al.\n10.1145/259081.259279, and Zhou et al. 10.1109/TVCG.2018.2796555.

Today, the market leader Amazon runs six\nmarketspaces for trading virtual machines. Consumers can purchase bundles of\nvirtual machines, which are called cloud-portfolios, from multiple marketspaces\nand providers.

Therefore,\npricing data from Amazon was used as well as a real virtual machine utilization\ndataset from the Bitbrains datacenter. The results show that a cost optimum can\nonly be reached if heterogeneous portfolios are created where virtual machines\nare purchased from different marketspaces. Additionally, the cost-benefit of\nmigrating virtual machines to different marketplaces during runtime is\npresented. Such migrations are especially cost-effective for virtual machines\nof cloud-portfolios which run between 6 hours and 1 year.

To conduct robust\nfine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the\nmodel update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss\nobjective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,\nand the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust\ngeneralization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when\nexposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time.

For analysis and visualization, topological primitives such as\ncontour trees can be used, but these often need simplification to filter out\nsmall-scale features. For parcel-based convective cloud simulations,\nsimplification of the contour tree requires a volumetric measure rather than\npersistence. Unlike for cubic meshes, volume cannot be approximated by counting\nregular vertices. Typically, this is addressed by resampling irregular data\nonto a uniform grid. Unfortunately, the spatial proximity of parcels requires a\nhigh sampling frequency, resulting in a massive increase in data size for\nprocessing. We therefore extend volume-based contour tree simplification to\nparcel-in-cell simulations with a graph adaptor in Viskores (VTK-m), using\nDelaunay tetrahedralization of the parcel centroids as input. Instead of\nrelying on a volume approximation by counting regular vertices -- as was done\nfor cubic meshes -- we adapt the 2D area splines reported by Bajaj et al.\n10.1145/259081.259279, and Zhou et al. 10.1109/TVCG.2018.2796555.

Consequently, these findings support the\nview that static analysis can be a valuable instrument for detecting latent\ndefects and an important safeguard for organizations that deploy AI in software\ndevelopment."}

Under review", "summary": "In this paper, we study the robustness of classical deep hedging strategies\nunder distributional shifts by leveraging the concept of adversarial attacks.\nWe first demonstrate that standard deep hedging models are highly vulnerable to\nsmall perturbations in the input distribution, resulting in significant\nperformance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose an adversarial training\nframework tailored to increase the robustness of deep hedging strategies. Our\napproach extends pointwise adversarial attacks to the distributional setting\nand introduces a computationally tractable reformulation of the adversarial\noptimization problem over a Wasserstein ball. This enables the efficient\ntraining of hedging strategies that are resilient to distributional\nperturbations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that\nadversarially trained deep hedging strategies consistently outperform their\nclassical counterparts in terms of out-of-sample performance and resilience to\nmodel misspecification. Our findings establish a practical and effective\nframework for robust deep hedging under realistic market uncertainties."}

The concordance index, or C-index, is a widely\nused metric for this purpose, particularly with the growing development of\nmachine learning methods. Beyond differences between proposed C-index\nestimators (e.g. Harrell's, Uno's and Antolini's), we demonstrate the existence\nof a C-index multiverse among available R and python software, where seemingly\nequal implementations can yield different results. This can undermine\nreproducibility and complicate fair comparisons across models and studies. Key\nvariation sources include tie handling and adjustment to censoring.\nAdditionally, the absence of a standardised approach to summarise risk from\nsurvival distributions, result in another source of variation dependent on\ninput types. We demonstrate the consequences of the C-index multiverse when\nquantifying predictive performance for several survival models (from Cox\nproportional hazards to recent deep learning approaches) on publicly available\nbreast cancer data, and semi-synthetic examples. Our work emphasises the need\nfor better reporting to improve transparency and reproducibility. This article\naims to be a useful guideline, helping analysts when navigating the multiverse,\nproviding unified documentation and highlighting potential pitfalls of existing\nsoftware.

We construct\ntranslated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen\n2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT\ngeneration across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments\nreveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot\nlanguage varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves\nperformance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and\nproves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning\nremain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but\ndoes not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune\nusing only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\\% in Swahili. Third,\ndata quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully\ncurated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier\ncorpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results\nclarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated\ndatasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research."}
