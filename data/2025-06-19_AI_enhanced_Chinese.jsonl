Serving\nthese models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes\nstatic weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights\nare constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV\ncaches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for\nefficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle\nruntime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory\nmanagement relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a\npage table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction.\nThis virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory\nfragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime\nmemory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization\nunder dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.\n  To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management\nframework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating\nsystems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction,\nwhich decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU\nmemory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory\nMechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory\ninflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3)\na Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize\nmemory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under\nstringent SLO constraints.

However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on\nutilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in\nexisting time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for\nmodels to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,\nsuch as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends\nbeyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed\npositional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical\ninformation into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key\ninnovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping\nphysics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding\nmechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and\nsequential order of tokens within the embedding space.

Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how\nto best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While\nprevious works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked\nto the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that\nthe graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we\nconsider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled\nby an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and\nonly the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split\nthe problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination\nstrategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm\nand, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph\nrecovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove\nthat its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with\nbounded treewidth.

Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage\nand retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater\nstorage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during\nretrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate\nthis issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single\nlane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of\nmulti-deep storage systems.\n  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to\naddress the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous\nitem configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the\nobjective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's\ntopology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both\nitem attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep\nwarehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network\narchitecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer\nmodel. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into\nembeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these\nembeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong\ngeneralization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage\nsystems with diverse layouts.

Built upon\nTenstorrent's Tensix architecture, this technology decouples the movement of\ndata from compute, potentially offering increased control to the programmer.\nExploring different optimisation techniques to address the bottlenecks inherent\nin data movement, we demonstrate that for a 2D FFT whilst the Wormhole n300 is\nslower than a server-grade 24-core Xeon Platinum CPU, the Wormhole draws around\n8 times less power and consumes around 2.8 times less energy than the CPU when\ncomputing the Fourier transform.", "AI": {"tldr": "RISC-V\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5728HPC\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\uff0cTenstorrent Wormhole RISC-V\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5728FFT\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u8282\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22RISC-V\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5728HPC\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u5f00\u653e\u6807\u51c6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Cooley-Tukey FFT\u7b97\u6cd5\u79fb\u690d\u5230Tenstorrent Wormhole RISC-V\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "result": "Wormhole n300\u57282D FFT\u4e2d\u867d\u6162\u4e8e24\u6838Xeon Platinum CPU\uff0c\u4f46\u529f\u8017\u4f4e8\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u4f4e2.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "RISC-V\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5728\u8282\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9002\u5408HPC\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully\nutilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool\n(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for\ndifferent concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test\nsample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we\nrefer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it\nindicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the\ncurrent nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.\nSimultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be\ncleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters.

The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use\ncheckpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an\nadditional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield\nsignificant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases\nand scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,\nCheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by\na weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state\nof the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,\nbecause of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover\nfailures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+\nwith out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last\nstages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is\nmimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by\nsimply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover\nthe (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring\nstages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively\nevaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with\nvarying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates\n(5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant\ncomputation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%.

Significant recent research\nestablished the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee\nconvergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the\naggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in\nwhether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and\ninvestigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions\nfrom distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone\ndo not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that\nreaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings\ndue to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower\nbound of $\\min\\{\\frac{n-t}{t},\\sqrt{d}\\}$ on the centroid approximation under\nbox validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the\nnumber of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and\n$d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower\nbound by an upper bound of $2\\min\\{n,\\sqrt{d}\\}$, by providing a new analysis\nfor the case $n<d$.

Diagnosing\nAMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.\nThere is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,\nclinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive\nAbstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed\nat improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and\nflexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by\nidentifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important\nfeatures identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical\nknowledge.

A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL\nreward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated\nRL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning\ndomains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built\nthrough domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure\nreliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically\nrevisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant\nvariation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL\nprimarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal\na more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,\nScience) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with\nlimited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain\ntraining to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely\nto facilitate genuine skill acquisition.

It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the\ntarget domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this\napproach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target\nerror, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement\ndiscrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and\ntarget domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement\nshould be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to\nhigh enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).\nMaximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain,\nremoving the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to\nestimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2.

While previous works have explored representation learning for\nthis task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential\nrepresentations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been\noverlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)\nstate representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are\nmet: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization\nmethods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation\nregularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the\nMIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces\nrepresentations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies\nwith superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$).

The method rasterises\nheterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines)\nonto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a\nzone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi\ntessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within\nevery 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and\nfloating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under\nfeeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage\nheuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of\nsites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.\n  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile\ncoverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income\nresidents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission\nheadroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for\nnational-scale roll-outs.

The advantage of these\nmethods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise\nunattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based\nsolutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from\ndiffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting\nfactors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the\napproximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains\nunclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We\naddress the issue by employing a Schr\\\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between\nthe distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate\nthe learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we\nextend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\\\"odinger Bridge\n($\\text{I}^2\\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional\nImage-to-Image Schr\\\"odinger Bridge (c$\\text{I}^2\\text{SB}$) framework.

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of\nreward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining\nthe background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an\noverview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the\nsource, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this\nunderstanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling\ntechniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we\nconclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.\nAltogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling\nthe vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u6765\u6e90\u3001\u673a\u5236\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u53ca\u65b0\u5174\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Our tool based on the\nContrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze\nvisual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of\nage and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for\npresenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to\nseek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the\nAI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our\nvisualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics\nfrom our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also\nindicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic\ncategories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in\nAI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they\nwere not against the use of AI in this context.

To address this gap,\nwe introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use\nagents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test\nmodels across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt\ninjection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150\ntasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright\ninfringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to\ninteract with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser,\netc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and\nsafety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and\n0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier\nmodels - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide\ninsights into their safety.

We present a transformer-based deep learning\nmodel that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to\nforecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic\nseismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of\nthe MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model\nachieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the\n15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty\nestimates through a learned standard deviation term.

Trained on two response\nevaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,\nPrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback\nthan traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive\nevaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,\nwe show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length\nresponses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with\nthe verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using\nPrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better\naligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics.

However, in complex environments,\nthe number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical\nproperties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a\nsingle global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system\nidentification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant\naspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation\nof energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility\nfor any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable,\nparticularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model\nPredictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it\ncontext-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system\nidentification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed\ncontrol.

We introduce \\textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based\nReward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency\nand output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a\nmargin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to\nidentify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second\nstage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or\nexhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded\nevaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence\ncontinuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments\nacross multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions\nthat are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and\nexplanatory, while achieving over 4$\\times$ speedup compared to existing\nvalue-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA\nMistral-7B, \\textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger\nunseen model}.
