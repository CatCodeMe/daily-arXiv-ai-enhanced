The first two effects are modeled using a concave\nfunction of user interest with repeated exposure, while the third effect is\nmodeled using a temporal decay function, which explains the decline in user\ninterest due to overexposure.

Building on this insight, we propose FedOC (Federated learning with\nOverlapping Clients), a novel framework designed to fully exploit the potential\nof these overlapping clients. In FedOC, overlapping clients could serve dual\nroles: (1) as Relay Overlapping Clients (ROCs), they forward edge models\nbetween neighboring ESs in real time to facilitate model sharing among\ndifferent ESs; and (2) as Normal Overlapping Clients (NOCs), they dynamically\nselect their initial model for local training based on the edge model delivery\ntime, which enables indirect data fusion among different regions of ESs.

We formulate an\noptimization problem to interleave training and inferencing minibatches, and\ndecide the device power mode and inference minibatch size, while maximizing the\ntraining throughput and staying within latency and power budgets, with modest\nprofiling costs. We propose GMD, an efficient multi-dimensional gradient\ndescent search which profiles just $15$ power modes; and ALS, an Active\nLearning technique which identifies reusable Pareto-optimal power modes, but\nprofiles $50$--$150$ power modes. We evaluate these within our Fulcrum\nscheduler for $273,000+$ configurations across $15$ DNN workloads. We also\nevaluate our strategies on dynamic arrival inference and concurrent inferences.\nALS and GMD outperform simpler and more complex baselines with larger-scale\nprofiling. Their solutions satisfy the latency and power budget for $>97\\%$ of\nour runs, and on average are within $7\\%$ of the optimal throughput."}

Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate\nenergy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to\nreflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce\na bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM\nsystems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under\nrealistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median\nenergy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200\nbillion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using\nproduction-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and\nassumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling\nscenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x\nto 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver\nthe largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the\nmodel, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median\nreductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can\nplausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we\nestimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion\nqueries to be 0.8 GWh/day.

To address this gap, we\npropose a novel methodology for the verification, evaluation, and risk\nassessment of deep learning systems.

By traversing this tree, we can compute credible and precise estimates of\nnetwork accuracy. We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which\nwe simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of\ndistributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional\nevaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and\n0.1. We further showcase the potential of our approach on a medical\nsegmentation benchmark, wherein we apply our methods towards risk assessment by\nassociating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses and\nvalue-judgments.

Learning the modules'\ninput/output functions is also necessary for designing new systems from\ndifferent composition architectures. Here, we propose a modular learning\nframework, which incorporates prior knowledge of the system's compositional\nstructure to (a) identify the composing modules' input/output functions from\nthe system's input/output data and (b) achieve this by using a reduced amount\nof data compared to what would be required without knowledge of the\ncompositional structure. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of modular\nidentifiability, which allows recovery of modules' input/output functions from\na subset of the system's input/output data, and provide theoretical guarantees\non a class of systems motivated by genetic circuits. We demonstrate the theory\non computational studies showing that a neural network (NNET) that accounts for\nthe compositional structure can learn the composing modules' input/output\nfunctions and predict the system's output on inputs outside of the training set\ndistribution. By contrast, a neural network that is agnostic of the structure\nis unable to predict on inputs that fall outside of the training set\ndistribution.

Consequently, relearning attacks\nexploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate\nthe steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly\nrecovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical\nrobustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To\naddress this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided\noptimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via\nneighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses\nadversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering\nfeedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through\ngradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that\nour method is significantly more robust against both relearning and\njailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance."}

In this perspective, we introduce\na bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM\nsystems based on token throughput.

Extending to test-time scaling\nscenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x\nto 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver\nthe largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the\nmodel, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median\nreductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can\nplausibly deliver 8-20x reductions.

At the base station (BS),\ntwo complementary branches produce candidate precoders: one is a feedback-only\nprecoding network driven by quantized downlink observations, and the other is\nan SRS-only precoding network driven by uplink SRS. These candidate precoders\nare subsequently combined by a fusion precoding network to yield the final\ntransmit precoder. All the modules are trained with a\nspectral-efficiency-oriented loss under a three-stage schedule. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed approach effectively harnesses both SRS-derived\ninformation and UE feedback, achieving markedly better performance than\nconventional baselines."}

To address the shortcomings of current machine learning (ML)-based\ndenoising algorithms, we present a signal filtration algorithm driven by a new\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) framework.

Under our psychological behavior model, we ask\nthe following question: Given a continuous time interval $T$, how many ads\nshould be shown, and at what times, to maximize the user interest towards the\nads?\n  Towards answering this question, we first show that, if the number of\ndisplayed ads is fixed, then the optimal ad-schedule only depends on the\noperant conditioning function. Our main result is a quasi-linear time algorithm\nthat outputs a near-optimal ad-schedule, i.e., the difference in the\nperformance of our schedule and the optimal schedule is exponentially small.\nOur algorithm leads to significant insights about optimal ad placement and\nshows that simple heuristics such as uniform spacing are sub-optimal under many\nnatural settings. The optimal number of ads to display, which also depends on\nthe mere exposure and hedonistic adaptation functions, can be found through a\nsimple linear search given the above algorithm. We further support our findings\nwith experimental results, demonstrating that our strategy outperforms various\nbaselines."}

Experiments were conducted on datasets in English, Spanish,\nGerman, and Urdu, including benchmark test sets from recent shared tasks. Our\nresults show that transformer models significantly outperform traditional\nbaselines, with XLM-RoBERTa achieving the highest overall accuracy.\nFurthermore, our active learning strategy maintained strong performance even\nwith small annotated datasets.

However, existing\napproaches either depend on external motion capture systems or fail to\ngeneralize across diverse tasks. We introduce VisualMimic, a visual sim-to-real\nframework that unifies egocentric vision with hierarchical whole-body control\nfor humanoid robots. VisualMimic combines a task-agnostic low-level keypoint\ntracker -- trained from human motion data via a teacher-student scheme -- with\na task-specific high-level policy that generates keypoint commands from visual\nand proprioceptive input. To ensure stable training, we inject noise into the\nlow-level policy and clip high-level actions using human motion statistics.\nVisualMimic enables zero-shot transfer of visuomotor policies trained in\nsimulation to real humanoid robots, accomplishing a wide range of\nloco-manipulation tasks such as box lifting, pushing, football dribbling, and\nkicking. Beyond controlled laboratory settings, our policies also generalize\nrobustly to outdoor environments. Videos are available at:\nhttps://visualmimic.github.io ."}

This\npaper introduces a GEneral Synthetic-Powered Inference (GESPI) framework that\nwraps around any statistical inference procedure to safely enhance sample\nefficiency by combining synthetic and real data. Our framework leverages\nhigh-quality synthetic data to boost statistical power, yet adaptively defaults\nto the standard inference method using only real data when synthetic data is of\nlow quality. The error of our method remains below a user-specified bound\nwithout any distributional assumptions on the synthetic data, and decreases as\nthe quality of the synthetic data improves. This flexibility enables seamless\nintegration with conformal prediction, risk control, hypothesis testing, and\nmultiple testing procedures, all without modifying the base inference method.\nWe demonstrate the benefits of our method on challenging tasks with limited\nlabeled data, including AlphaFold protein structure prediction, and comparing\nlarge reasoning models on complex math problems."}
