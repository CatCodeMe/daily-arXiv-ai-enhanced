The goal is to\nfind a minimum-cost sequence of swaps of adjacent tokens to reach the final\nassignment from the initial assignment, where the cost is the sum over all\nswaps of the sum of the weights of the two swapped tokens. Unweighted token\nswapping has been extensively studied: it is NP-hard to approximate to a factor\nbetter than $14/13$, and there is a polynomial-time 4-approximation, along with\na tight \"barrier\" result showing that the class of locally optimal algorithms\ncannot achieve a ratio better than 4. For trees, the problem remains NP-hard to\nsolve exactly, and there is a polynomial-time 2-approximation, along with a\ntight barrier result showing that the class of $\\ell$-straying algorithms\ncannot achieve a ratio better than 2. Weighted token swapping with $\\{0,1\\}$\nweights is much harder to approximation: it is NP-hard to approximate even to a\nfactor of $(1-\\varepsilon) \\cdot \\ln n$ for any constant $\\varepsilon>0$.\nRestricting to positive weights, no approximation algorithms are known, and the\nonly known lower bounds are those inherited directly from the unweighted\nversion.

To embrace flexibility, knowledge\ngraphs often lack enforced schemas (i.e., ontologies), leading to potential\ndata quality issues, such as semantically overlapping nodes. Therefore,\nensuring their quality is essential, as issues in the data can affect\napplications relying on them. To assess the quality of knowledge graphs,\nexisting works either propose high-level frameworks comprising various data\nquality dimensions without concrete implementations, define tools that measure\ndata quality with ad-hoc SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language)\nqueries, or promote the usage of constraint languages, such as the Shapes\nConstraint Language (SHACL), to assess and improve the quality of the graph.\nAlthough the latter approaches claim to address data quality assessment, none\nof them comprehensively tries to cover all data quality dimensions.

Reasoning! Efficient Directed Fuzzing via Large Language Models", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.AI", "cs.CR", "cs.PL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Fuzzing is highly effective in detecting bugs due to the key contribution of\nrandomness. However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of\nfuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed\nfuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations,\nthe dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical\ncomponents, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely\ntied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the\nchallenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to\nremove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With\ntheir strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to\ngenerate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct\nbug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which\nintegrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and\nmutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call\nchain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To\nconstruct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis,\nobtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which\nfurther help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate\nRandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo,\nBeacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz.

CodableLLM supports multiple programming languages and\nintegrates with existing decompilers and parsers to streamline dataset\ngeneration. This paper presents the design and implementation of CodableLLM,\nevaluates its performance in dataset creation, and compares it to existing\ntools in the field. The results demonstrate that CodableLLM offers a robust and\nefficient solution for generating datasets tailored for code-focused LLMS.", "AI": {"tldr": "CodableLLM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aPython\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6574\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53cd\u7f16\u8bd1\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u539f\u59cb\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53cd\u7f16\u8bd1\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53cd\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6587\u4ef6\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0CodableLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u73b0\u6709\u53cd\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u5668\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "CodableLLM\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "CodableLLM\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose\na profit driven framework that integrates three key mechanisms which are\ncollaborative caching, erasure coding, and elastic storage partitioning. Unlike\ntraditional replication, erasure coding enables space efficient redundancy,\nallowing data to be reconstructed from any subset of K out of K plus M coded\nblocks. We dynamically partition each edge server s storage into private and\npublic regions. The private region is further subdivided among access points\nbased on their incoming request rates, enabling adaptive control over data\nlocality and ownership.

Most existing graph-based\nindexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the\ndata after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,\ndeletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in\napplications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently\nsupports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based\nindexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query\nquality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to\nmaintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve\nthese problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main\ncomponents: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to\ncombat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood\nconsolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory\ncleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the\nwork spent by the first two components.

We introduce two novel hybrid\nactivation functions: S3 (Sigmoid-Softsign) and its improved version S4\n(smoothed S3). S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for\npositive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a\nsteepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary\nclassification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three\ndifferent neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance\ncompared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on\nMNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression.\nThe function exhibited faster convergence (-19 for ReLU) and maintained stable\ngradient flow across network depths. Comparative analysis revealed S4's\ngradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep\nnetworks.

Standard RL algorithms\ntypically are based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which assumes that\nthe current state of the environment provides all the necessary information for\nsystem evolution and decision-making. However, this Markovian assumption is\ninvalid in many practical scenarios, making the MDP and RL frameworks\ninadequate to produce the optimal solutions. Additionally, traditional RL\nalgorithms often employ function approximations (e.g., by neural networks) that\ndo not explicitly capture the spatial relationships inherent in environments\nwith complex network topologies.

Recent methods enhance CFM performance by\ninducing shorter and straighter trajectories but typically rely on\ncomputationally expensive mini-batch optimal transport (OT). Drawing insights\nfrom entropic optimal transport (EOT), we propose Weighted Conditional Flow\nMatching (W-CFM), a novel approach that modifies the classical CFM loss by\nweighting each training pair $(x, y)$ with a Gibbs kernel. We show that this\nweighting recovers the entropic OT coupling up to some bias in the marginals,\nand we provide the conditions under which the marginals remain nearly\nunchanged. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between W-CFM and the\nminibatch OT method in the large-batch limit, showing how our method overcomes\ncomputational and performance bottlenecks linked to batch size. Empirically, we\ntest our method on unconditional generation on various synthetic and real\ndatasets, confirming that W-CFM achieves comparable or superior sample quality,\nfidelity, and diversity to other alternative baselines while maintaining the\ncomputational efficiency of vanilla CFM.", "AI": {"tldr": "W-CFM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6CFM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u504f\u79bb\u76f4\u7ebf\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684OT\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faW-CFM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Gibbs\u6838\u52a0\u6743\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\uff0c\u6062\u590dEOT\u8026\u5408\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8fb9\u7f18\u5206\u5e03\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "result": "W-CFM\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "W-CFM\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86CFM\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

Existing techniques for APR are\noften combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the\ncode-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current\nLLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference\nstage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates\nit through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two\nimportant aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training\nphase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair.

Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the\nsimultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency.\nExperimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable\nparameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous\nbit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression\nrates.

Differentially private stochastic\ngradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a\npronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise,\ndegrading sample efficiency and final accuracy.

By combining a high-performance neural network with explainable AI\n(XAI) techniques, we can distill a model's learned strategy into\nhuman-interpretable rules. We apply this approach to the challenging case of\nmonotone matrices, defined by the condition that their inverses are entrywise\nnonnegative.

After establishing a labelled dataset by randomly\ngenerated monotone and non-monotone matrices uniformly on $(-1,1)$, we employ\ndeep neural network algorithms for classifying the matrices as monotone or\nnon-monotone, using both their entries and a comprehensive set of matrix\nfeatures.

Generative modeling based on density operator models\n(\\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such\nas those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data,\nsuch as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a\nfundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable\nmodels on real-world datasets. \\textit{In this paper, we develop an\nExpectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined\nthrough \\textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those\nused for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However,\ndesigning such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined\nquantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation\nstep. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum\ninformation projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map\nprovides a solution under sufficient conditions.

Traditional diagnostic workflows,\nhowever, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and\nresource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and\ninterpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature\nextraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration\nof handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our\nmodel to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features\nfrom retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark\ndatasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for\nGlaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates\nconsistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for\nbinary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the\nIC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\\% accuracy, 94.8\\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,\noutperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA,\nour model achieves 83.9\\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive\nperformance despite dataset limitations.

One of the goals\nof safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing\nwith real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,\nwhere test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a\nquantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios\nmust be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is\nexpressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions\nabout the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while\navoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited\nparameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.\n  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF\nof the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple\nbase distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and\ndifferentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation\nwithout restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,\ncomparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional\nmethod for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational\nresources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.\nAs a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more\nprecise assessment of an ADS's safety.\n  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety.

The core idea is to construct a stochastic mapping from\nthe input to a high-dimensional latent representation, enabling\nuncertainty-aware prediction of the solution. Specifically, the architecture\nconsists of a confidence-aware encoder and a probabilistic decoder. The encoder\nimplements a high-dimensional latent variable model based on a Gaussian process\n(LVM-GP), where the latent representation is constructed by interpolating\nbetween a learnable deterministic feature and a Gaussian process prior, with\nthe interpolation strength adaptively controlled by a confidence function\nlearned from data.

OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,\nleading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised\nsetting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot\nsetting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching\nchallenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by\nthe classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we\nshow that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD\ndetection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD\ncombines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a\nspecific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier\ntrained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is\nmodular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus\nintroduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.\nWe evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also\nconsider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label\nnoise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been\npreviously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based\nOOD detection methods.

Recent design approaches of dental crowns are\ncarried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a\npreparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually\ndefine a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a\nnon-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework\nto determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A\ndataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to\ntrain a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was\nmodified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth\ninto two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary\nfaces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to\ntrain 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their\nresults to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and\noptimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation\nresults. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to\nrepresent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the\ncenters of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that\nan ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest\nnumber of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance\nthreshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground\ntruth point clouds.
