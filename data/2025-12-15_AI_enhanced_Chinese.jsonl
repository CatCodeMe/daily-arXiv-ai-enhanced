However, current approaches to building such agentic architectures remain largely ad hoc, lacking generality, scalability, and systematic optimization. Existing systems often rely on fixed models and single execution engines and are unable to efficiently optimize multiple agents operating over heterogeneous data sources and query engines. This paper presents a vision for a next-generation query optimization framework tailored to multi-agent workflows. We argue that optimizing these workflows can benefit from redesigning query optimization principles to account for new challenges: orchestration of diverse agents, cost efficiency under expensive LLM calls and across heterogeneous engines, and redundancy across tasks. Led by a real-world example and building on an analysis of multi-agent workflows, we outline our envisioned architecture and the main research challenges of building a multi-agent query optimization framework, which aims at enabling automated model selection, workflow composition, and execution across heterogeneous engines. This vision establishes the groundwork for query optimization in emerging multi-agent architectures and opens up a set of future research directions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5355\u4e00\u6267\u884c\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6848\u4f8b\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u67b6\u6784\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u539f\u5219\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f16\u6392\u3001\u6602\u8d35LLM\u8c03\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u5f15\u64ce\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u4efb\u52a1\u5197\u4f59\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u613f\u666f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u5f15\u64ce\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u613f\u666f\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u542f\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f16\u6392\u3001\u6210\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8de8\u5f15\u64ce\u6267\u884c\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Our algorithm improves upon the complexity of the recently introduced output-sensitive algorithm for acyclic CRPQs. More notably, the complexity of our algorithm for a given acyclic CRPQ Q matches the best known output-sensitive complexity for the \"corresponding\" conjunctive query (CQ), that is the CQ that has the same structure as the CRPQ Q except that each RPQ is replaced with a binary atom (or a join of two binary atoms). This implies that it is not possible to improve upon our complexity for acyclic CRPQs without improving the state-of-the-art on output-sensitive evaluation for acyclic CQs. Our result is surprising because RPQs, and by extension CRPQs, are equivalent to recursive Datalog programs, which are generally poorly understood from a complexity standpoint.

Accepted at ICDE 2026. Publisher version will appear in the ICDE 2026 proceedings", "summary": "Reinforcement learning has recently been used to enhance index structures, giving rise to reinforcement learning-enhanced spatial indices (RLESIs) that aim to improve query efficiency during index construction. However, their practical benefits remain unclear due to the lack of unified implementations and comprehensive evaluations, especially in disk-based settings.\n  We present the first modular and extensible benchmark for RLESIs. Built on top of an existing spatial index library, our framework decouples index training from building, supports parameter tuning, and enables consistent comparison with traditional, advanced, and learned spatial indices.\n  We evaluate 12 representative spatial indices across six datasets and diverse workloads, including point, range, kNN, spatial join, and mixed read/write queries. Using latency, I/O, and index statistics as metrics, we find that while RLESIs can reduce query latency with tuning, they consistently underperform learned spatial indices and advanced variants in both query efficiency and index build cost. These findings highlight that although RLESIs offer promising architectural compatibility, their high tuning costs and limited generalization hinder practical adoption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684RLESI\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0RLESI\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u4f18\u964d\u4f4e\u67e5\u8be2\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6784\u5efa\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5747\u4e0d\u5982\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7d22\u5f15\uff08RLESI\uff09\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u8fdb\u7d22\u5f15\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u78c1\u76d8\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u76ca\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u7d22\u5f15\u5e93\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7d22\u5f15\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6784\u5efa\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u3001\u9ad8\u7ea7\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7d22\u5f15\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8612\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u7d22\u5f15\u57286\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\uff1aRLESI\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u4f18\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u67e5\u8be2\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7d22\u5f15\u6784\u5efa\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u4e0d\u5982\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u53d8\u4f53\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001I/O\u548c\u7d22\u5f15\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1RLESI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u8c03\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86RLESI\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

The frequency of such anomalies increases with network scale. However, existing fault-tolerance mechanisms, such as checkpointing and runtime resilience methods, primarily operate at the application layer and inevitably cause disruptions in training progress.\n  We propose to address this challenge by introducing fault tolerance at the Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) layer and integrating it with existing application-layer techniques. We present SHIFT, a fault-resilient layer over RDMA that enables seamless redirection of RDMA traffic across different intra-host NICs. By allowing applications to continue execution in the presence of network anomalies until the next checkpoint, SHIFT effectively minimizes training progress loss. SHIFT is designed to be application-agnostic, transparent to applications, and low-overhead.\n  Through a carefully designed failure state machine and control flow, unmodified applications such as PyTorch with NCCL can run with RDMA-level fault tolerance. Experimental results demonstrate that SHIFT introduces minimal data path overhead while ensuring application continuity under network failures.", "AI": {"tldr": "SHIFT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728RDMA\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb9\u9519\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u4e0d\u540cNIC\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411RDMA\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5f02\u5e38\u65f6\u80fd\u7ee7\u7eed\u6267\u884c\u76f4\u5230\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u7f51\u7edc\u5f02\u5e38\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7gang scheduling\u4f20\u64ad\u5bfc\u81f4\u6574\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5bb9\u9519\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6062\u590d\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u5c42\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u4e2d\u65ad\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5728RDMA\u5c42\u5f15\u5165\u5bb9\u9519\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1SHIFT\u4f5c\u4e3aRDMA\u4e0a\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6545\u969c\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u4e3b\u673a\u5185NIC\u7684RDMA\u6d41\u91cf\u65e0\u7f1d\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u3002", "result": "SHIFT\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8def\u5f84\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002\u672a\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5982PyTorch with NCCL\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728RDMA\u7ea7\u5bb9\u9519\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "SHIFT\u901a\u8fc7RDMA\u5c42\u5bb9\u9519\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u5c42\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u662f\u5e94\u7528\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u5bf9\u5e94\u7528\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Consequently, there is a growing need for more efficient testing methods. To reduce the burden on developers, various automated test generation tools have been developed, and several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the tests they produce. However, most of these studies focus primarily on coverage metrics, and only a few examine how well the tests support fault localization-particularly using artificial faults introduced through mutation testing. In this study, we compare the SBFL (Spectrum-Based Fault Localization) score and code coverage of automatically generated tests with those of manually created tests. The SBFL score indicates how accurately faults can be localized using SBFL techniques. By employing SBFL score as an evaluation metric-an approach rarely used in prior studies on test generation-we aim to provide new insights into the respective strengths and weaknesses of manually created and automatically generated tests. Our experimental results show that automatically generated tests achieve higher branch coverage than manually created tests, but their SBFL score is lower, especially for code with deeply nested structures.

In the present scenario, most of the energy sources are limited and have a greenhouse effect on the environment. Therefore, it is the need of the hour that the energy consumed by the cloud service providers must be reduced and it is a great challenge to the research community to develop energy-efficient algorithms. To design the same, some researchers tried to maximize the average resource utilization, whereas some researchers tried to minimize the makespan. However, they have not considered different types of resources that are present in the physical machines. In this paper, we propose a task scheduling algorithm, which tries to improve utilization of resources (like CPU, disk, I/O) explicitly, which in turn increases the utilization of active resources. For this, the proposed algorithm uses a fitness value, which is a function of CPU, disk and I/O utilization, and processing time of the task. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive simulations are performed on both proposed algorithm and existing algorithm MaxUtil using synthetic datasets.

Similarity search, a fundamental operation that retrieves nodes similar to a given query node, plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, including machine learning and graph clustering. However, existing state-of-the-art methods often struggle to accurately capture the unique structural properties of bipartite graphs or fail to incorporate the informative node attributes, leading to suboptimal performance. Besides, their high computational complexity limits scalability, making them impractical for large graphs with millions of nodes and tens of thousands of attributes. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce Attribute-augmented Hidden Personalized PageRank (AHPP), a novel random walk model designed to blend seamlessly both the higher-order bipartite structure proximity and attribute similarity. We then formulate the similarity search over attributed bipartite graphs as an approximate AHPP problem and propose two efficient push-style local algorithms with provable approximation guarantees.

Existing datasets rely on human demonstrations, limiting scalability. A natural alternative is to synthesize data from strong CUAs, yet their rollouts are highly noisy, with incorrect or suboptimal actions consisting a large proportion of the steps, making naive imitation ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that transforms noisy rollouts into reliable supervision without human annotation. The core idea is step-level filtering, which evaluates actions individually to retain only correct steps, complemented by reasoning augmentation for improved planning. Using this pipeline, we construct WebSTAR, a dataset of 13.3K trajectories and 100K graded, reasoning-rich steps synthesized from OpenAI's computer-use-preview model. We train Qwen-2.5-VL-Instruct models (7B and 32B) on WebSTAR. On WebVoyager, our 7B model surpasses SoTA open-source CUA model UI-TARS-1.5-7B by more than 15% with only supervised finetuning. Building on step-level grading, we further create WebSCORE, a dataset of graded step-level actions, and train StepRM, a 7B multimodal reward model distilled from o4-mini, which matches its grading quality while being far more efficient to deploy at scale.

We collect and fully decode eight core event types -- Supply, Borrow, Withdraw, Repay, LiquidationCall, FlashLoan, ReserveDataUpdated, and MintedToTreasury -- producing over 50 million structured records enriched with block metadata and USD valuations.\n  Using an open-source Python pipeline with dynamic batch sizing and automatic sharding (each file less than or equal to 1 million rows), we ensure strict chronological ordering and full reproducibility. The resulting publicly available dataset enables granular analysis of capital flows, interest rate dynamics, liquidation cascades, and cross-chain user behavior, providing a foundational resource for future studies on decentralized lending markets and systemic risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684Aave V3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d66\u6761\u4e3b\u8981EVM\u94fe\uff0c\u5305\u542b8\u79cd\u6838\u5fc3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc75000\u4e07\u6761\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u501f\u8d37\u5e02\u573a\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u501f\u8d37\u534f\u8bae\uff08\u5982Aave V3\uff09\u7ba1\u7406\u7740\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u603b\u9501\u5b9a\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u8de8\u94fe\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5f00\u6e90Python\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u5e76\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u7801Aave V3\u57286\u6761\u4e3b\u8981EVM\u517c\u5bb9\u94fe\uff08\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u3001Arbitrum\u3001Optimism\u3001Polygon\u3001Avalanche\u548cBase\uff09\u4e0a\u76848\u79cd\u6838\u5fc3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u6279\u5904\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7247\u6280\u672f\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc75000\u4e07\u6761\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bcf\u6761\u8bb0\u5f55\u90fd\u5305\u542b\u533a\u5757\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7f8e\u5143\u4f30\u503c\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6309\u4e25\u683c\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6587\u4ef6\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u884c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u8d44\u672c\u6d41\u52a8\u3001\u5229\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u6e05\u7b97\u7ea7\u8054\u548c\u8de8\u94fe\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5c06\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u5bf9\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u501f\u8d37\u5e02\u573a\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

These networks increasingly need a scalable and efficient multicast protocol for critical applications like emergency alerts, large-scale software updates, and real-time broadcasting. However, traditional multicast protocols, such as IP-based multicast and software-defined multicast approaches, introduce significant control overhead and struggle to adapt to the dynamic and mobile nature of satellite topologies. This paper presents BIER-Star, a stateless multicast protocol designed for the integrated TN-NTN. BIER-Star uses a two-layer geospatial gridding scheme (i.e., H3) to encode destinations as Earth- and space-cell identifiers rather than per-terminal addresses. This cell-based abstraction shortens the header bitstring, simplifies forwarding, and eliminates per-flow state and complex signaling. Our simulations indicate that BIER-Star reduces header size versus BIER and avoids geographic path-finding failures seen in greedy methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "BIER-Star\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5929\u5730\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u7ec4\u64ad\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u5c42\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f51\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u76ee\u7684\u5730\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5934\u90e8\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u8f6c\u53d1", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LEO\u536b\u661f\u661f\u5ea7\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5929\u5730\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ec4\u64ad\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u652f\u6301\u7d27\u6025\u8b66\u62a5\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8f6f\u4ef6\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e7f\u64ad\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4f20\u7edfIP\u7ec4\u64ad\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u7ec4\u64ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u536b\u661f\u62d3\u6251\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u5f00\u9500\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "BIER-Star\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u5c42\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6848\uff08H3\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u5730\u7403\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5355\u5143\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u800c\u975e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec8\u7aef\u5730\u5740\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5143\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u7f29\u77ed\u4e86\u5934\u90e8\u6bd4\u7279\u4e32\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8f6c\u53d1\uff0c\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u6bcf\u6d41\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4fe1\u4ee4\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cBIER-Star\u76f8\u6bd4BIER\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5934\u90e8\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8d2a\u5a6a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5730\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u67e5\u627e\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "BIER-Star\u4e3a\u5929\u5730\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u7ec4\u64ad\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f51\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u536b\u661f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing LLMs face several challenges when generating Verilog code for finite state machine (FSM) control logic, including frequent syntax errors, low debugging efficiency, and heavy reliance on test benchmarks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes AutoFSM, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed for FSM code generation tasks. AutoFSM introduces a structurally clear intermediate representation (IR) to reduce syntax error rate during code generation and provides a supporting toolchain to enable automatic translation from IR to Verilog. Furthermore, AutoFSM is the first to integrate SystemC-based modeling with automatic testbench generation, thereby improving debugging efficiency and feedback quality. To systematically evaluate the framework's performance, we construct SKT-FSM, the first hierarchical FSM benchmark in the field, comprising 67 FSM samples across different complexity levels. Experimental results show that, under the same base LLM, AutoFSM consistently outperforms the open-source framework MAGE on the SKT-FSM benchmark, achieving up to an 11.94% improvement in pass rate and up to a 17.62% reduction in syntax error rate.

TritorX integrates open-source large language models with a custom linter, JIT compilation, and a PyTorch OpInfo-based test harness. This pipeline is compatible with both real Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) silicon and in hardware simulation environments for next-generation devices. In contrast to previous kernel-generation approaches that prioritize performance for a limited set of high-usage kernels, TritorX prioritizes coverage.

While this is a well established concept for strings, in the context of tries the state-of-the-art regarding entropies is less developed. The standard trie worst-case entropy considers the set of tries with a fixed number of nodes and alphabet size. However, this approach does not consider the frequencies of the symbols in the trie, thus failing to capture the compressibility of tries with skewed character distributions. On the other hand, the label entropy [FOCS '05], proposed for node-labeled trees, does not take into account the tree topology, which has to be stored separately. In this paper, we introduce two new entropy measures for tries - worst-case and empirical - which overcome the two aforementioned limitations. Notably, our entropies satisfy similar properties of their string counterparts, thereby becoming very natural generalizations of the (simpler) string case. Indeed, our empirical entropy is closely related to the worst-case entropy and is reachable through a natural extension of arithmetic coding from strings to tries. Moreover we show that, similarly to the FM-index for strings [JACM '05], the XBWT of a trie can be compressed and efficiently indexed within our k-th order empirical entropy plus o(n) bits, with n being the number of nodes. Interestingly, the space usage of this encoding includes the trie topology and the upper-bound holds for every k sufficiently small, simultaneously. This XBWT encoding is always strictly smaller than the original one [JACM '09] and we show that in certain cases it is asymptotically smaller.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684trie\u71b5\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06XBWT\u538b\u7f29\u5230k\u9636\u7ecf\u9a8c\u71b5\u52a0o(n)\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684trie\u71b5\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6807\u51c6\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u71b5\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u7b26\u53f7\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u504f\u659c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6027\uff1b\u6807\u7b7e\u71b5\u5219\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6811\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u71b5\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684trie\u71b5\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1a\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u71b5\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u71b5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u71b5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0e\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u71b5\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u662f\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002\u7ecf\u9a8c\u71b5\u4e0e\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u71b5\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u672f\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u4ece\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230trie\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86trie\u7684XBWT\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728k\u9636\u7ecf\u9a8c\u71b5\u52a0o(n)\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u88ab\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dn\u662f\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u603b\u662f\u4e25\u683c\u5c0f\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbXBWT\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u662f\u6e10\u8fd1\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u71b5\u5ea6\u91cf\u662f\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u71b5\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u71b5\u7684XBWT\u7f16\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3atrie\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u7d22\u5f15\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Beyond improving diagnostic performance, MREF-AD provides modality- and region-level insight into how structural and molecular imaging jointly contribute to disease diagnosis.

Our approach handles the dynamic nature of mobile networks through three allocation strategies: an integer linear program for optimal allocation, a greedy heuristic for immediate deployment, and a multi-objective genetic algorithm for balanced optimization. Our initial evaluation analyzes application acceptance rates, resource utilization, and latency performance under resource limitations. Results demonstrate improvements over traditional approaches, providing a foundation for VNE deployment in highly mobile environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u865a\u62df\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u79fb\u52a8\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u53d7\u9650\u7f51\u72b6\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5feb\u901f\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u865a\u62df\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u9759\u6001\u6216\u7f13\u6162\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u4f46\u65b0\u5174\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u79fb\u52a8\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5305\u542b\u8bbe\u5907\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u7528\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u7528\u4e8e\u5373\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u8d2a\u5fc3\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u7528\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u79fb\u52a8\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684VNE\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u865a\u62df\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u79fb\u52a8\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper investigates the efficacy of 19 small, quantized LLMs (under 20 billion parameters) for the C to Java translation task. We use a novel, hybrid pipeline that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for semantic decomposition and employs a highly constrained, rule based prompting strategy. The results are stark: a clear multi tiered performance divide emerged. The vast majority of models (Tier 3, e.g., llama3.1, gemma3, starcoder2) failed 100\\% of the tests, proving incapable of generating even basic, runnable Java boilerplate. A small middle tier (Tier 2, e.g., mistral-nemo and mistral) produced runnable code but was plagued by dangerous semantic failures and wrong translations. Only three models (Tier 1: phi4, deepseek-coder-v2, codeqwen) proved viable, passing over 50\\% of the test suite.

[COCOON 2024]. A path in a vertex-colored graph is called conflict-free if there is a color that appears exactly once on its vertices. A connected graph is said to be strongly conflict-free vertex-connection $k$-colorable if it admits a (proper) vertex $k$-coloring such that any two distinct vertices are connected by a conflict-free shortest path. Among others, we show that deciding, for a given graph $G$ and an integer $k$, whether $G$ is strongly conflict-free $k$-colorable is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the vertex cover number. But under the standard complexity-theoretic assumption NP $\\not\\subseteq$ coNP/poly, deciding, for a given graph $G$, whether $G$ is strongly conflict-free $3$-colorable does not admit a polynomial kernel, even for bipartite graphs.

Our solution decomposes the joint resource allocation problem into three interdependent stages: (i) user association and communication resource allocation; (ii) VR-CG game engine placement with adaptive multipath routing; and (iii) attention-aware scheduling and wireless resource allocation based on motion-to-photon latency. For each stage, we design specialized heuristic algorithms that achieve near-optimal performance while significantly reducing computational time. We introduce a novel user-centric QoE model based on visual attention to virtual objects, guiding adaptive resolution and frame rate selection. A dataset-driven evaluation demonstrates that, when compared against state-of-the-art approaches, our framework improves QoE by up to 50\\%, reduces communication resource usage by 75\\%, and achieves up to 35\\% cost savings, while maintaining an average optimality gap of 5\\%.

Gall"], "title": "Towards Privacy-Preserving Code Generation: Differentially Private Code Language Models", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.AI", "cs.CR"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models specialized for code (CodeLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating code snippets, documentation, and test cases. However, despite their promising capabilities, CodeLLMs can inadvertently memorize and reproduce snippets from their training data, which poses risks of privacy breaches and intellectual property violations. These risks restrict the deployment of CodeLLMs in sensitive domains and limit their training datasets to publicly available sources. To mitigate the memorization risk without compromising their task performance, we apply Differential Privacy (DP) to CodeLLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of DP in CodeLLMs. DP adds calibrated noise to the training process to protect individual data points while still allowing the model to learn useful patterns. To this end, we first identify and understand the driving reasons of the memorization behaviour of the CodeLLMs during their fine-tuning. Then, to address this issue, we empirically evaluate the effect of DP on mitigating memorization while preserving code generation capabilities. Our findings show that DP substantially reduces memorization in CodeLLMs across all the tested snippet types. The snippet types most prone to memorization are also the most effectively mitigated by DP. Furthermore, we observe that DP slightly increases perplexity but preserves, and can even enhance, the code generation capabilities of CodeLLMs, which makes it feasible to apply DP in practice without significantly compromising model utility. Finally, we analyze the impact of DP on training efficiency and energy consumption, finding that DP does not significantly affect training time or energy usage, making it a practical choice for privacy-preserving CodeLLMs training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DP\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e76\u590d\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fb5\u6743\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u884c\u4e3a\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "DP\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6700\u5bb9\u6613\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u7c7b\u578b\u4e5f\u6700\u5bb9\u6613\u88abDP\u7f13\u89e3\u3002DP\u7565\u5fae\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u662f\u4fdd\u62a4\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\u800c\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72CodeLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This inefficiency is largely caused by fragmentation, heterogeneous workloads, and the limitations of static scheduling policies. This work presents a systematic evaluation of these issues and introduces three specialized dynamic schedulers: Hybrid Priority (HPS), Predictive Backfill (PBS), and Smart Batch (SBS). These schedulers are designed to improve utilization, fairness, and overall throughput in multi-tenant GPU clusters. We evaluate all schedulers using a controlled simulation of 1,000 AI jobs on a 64-GPU, 8-node cluster that includes a realistic mix of training, inference, and research workloads. Static baselines (FIFO, SJF, Shortest, Shortest-GPU) achieve 45 to 67% GPU utilization and 12.5 to 18.3 jobs per hour and experience severe starvation, with as many as 156 jobs waiting longer than 30 minutes. The dynamic schedulers significantly outperform these policies. HPS achieves the highest utilization (78.2%), highest throughput (25.8 jobs per hour), and the lowest fairness variance among dynamic methods (457), reducing starvation to 12 jobs. PBS improves fragmentation handling and reaches 76.1% utilization, while SBS increases efficiency for structurally similar jobs and reaches 74.6% utilization. Across all key metrics, including throughput, job wait times, fairness variance, and starvation, dynamic multi-objective schedulers consistently outperform single-objective heuristics. These results show that targeted and transparent scheduling strategies can meaningfully increase GPU efficiency in heterogeneous AI clusters and provide a practical foundation for future production scheduling frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668(HPS\u3001PBS\u3001SBS)\uff0c\u572864-GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5229\u7528\u7387\u81f378.2%\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4efb\u52a1\u9965\u997f\u73b0\u8c61", "motivation": "GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4ec5\u7ea650%\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u9759\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u5347\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u4e13\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff1a\u6df7\u5408\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7(HPS)\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u56de\u586b(PBS)\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u6279\u5904\u7406(SBS)\uff0c\u5728\u5305\u542b1000\u4e2aAI\u4efb\u52a1\u768464-GPU\u30018\u8282\u70b9\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30", "result": "\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1aHPS\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u5229\u7528\u738778.2%\u548c\u6700\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf25.8\u4efb\u52a1/\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u9965\u997f\u4efb\u52a1\u4ece156\u4e2a\u51cf\u5c11\u523012\u4e2a\uff1bPBS\u548cSBS\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523076.1%\u548c74.6%\u5229\u7528\u7387", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9965\u997f\u51cf\u5c11\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u751f\u4ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840"}}

This study proposes a data-driven metric and a continuous reward function to optimize personalized heparin therapy in surgical sepsis patients. Methods: Data from the MIMIC-IV v1.0 and eICU v2.0 databases were used for model development and evaluation. The training cohort consisted of abdominal surgery patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) after postoperative sepsis onset. We introduce a new RL-based framework: converting the discrete SOFA score to a continuous cxSOFA for more nuanced state and reward functions; Second, defining \"good\" or \"bad\" strategies based on cxSOFA by a stepwise manner; Third, proposing a Treatment Effect Comparison Matrix (TECM), analogous to a confusion matrix for classification tasks, to evaluate the treatment strategies. We applied different RL algorithms, Q-Learning, DQN, DDQN, BCQ and CQL to optimize the treatment and comprehensively evaluated the framework. Results: Among the AI-derived strategies, the cxSOFA-CQL model achieved the best performance, reducing mortality from 1.83% to 0.74% with the average hospital stay from 11.11 to 9.42 days.

This version further improves the FOCS results. Here is an extended talk video for FOCS (the improved results are not included in the video): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XDIIZzdZUM", "summary": "Let $\\mathcal{P}$ be the surface of a convex polyhedron with $n$ vertices. We consider the two-point shortest path query problem for $\\mathcal{P}$: Constructing a data structure so that given any two query points $s$ and $t$ on $\\mathcal{P}$, a shortest path from $s$ to $t$ on $\\mathcal{P}$ can be computed efficiently. To achieve $O(\\log n)$ query time (for computing the shortest path length), the previously best result uses $O(n^{8+\u03b5})$ preprocessing time and space [Aggarwal, Aronov, O'Rourke, and Schevon, SICOMP 1997], where $\u03b5$ is an arbitrarily small positive constant. In this paper, we present a new data structure of $O(n^{6+\u03b5})$ preprocessing time and space, with $O(\\log n)$ query time. For a special case where one query point is required to lie on one of the edges of $\\mathcal{P}$, the previously best work uses $O(n^{6+\u03b5})$ preprocessing time and space to achieve $O(\\log n)$ query time.

While multimodal deep learning models - leveraging facial expressions, speech, and textual cues - offer high accuracy in emotion recognition, their training and maintenance are often computationally intensive and inflexible to modality changes. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent framework for training multimodal emotion recognition systems, where each modality encoder and the fusion classifier operate as autonomous agents coordinated by a central supervisor. This architecture enables modular integration of new modalities (e.g., audio features via emotion2vec), seamless replacement of outdated components, and reduced computational overhead during training. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a proof-of-concept implementation supporting vision, audio, and text modalities, with the classifier serving as a shared decision-making agent.

However, we still know little about how these agents use libraries when generating code, a core part of real-world software development. To fill this gap, we study 26,760 agent-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset to examine three questions: how often do agents import libraries, how often do they introduce new dependencies (and with what versioning), and which specific libraries do they choose? We find that agents often import libraries (29.5% of PRs) but rarely add new dependencies (1.3% of PRs); and when they do, they follow strong versioning practices (75.0% specify a version), an improvement on direct LLM usage where versions are rarely mentioned.

Yet, modern AI models routinely exceed the resource capacity of individual devices, necessitating distributed execution across heterogeneous devices over variable and contention prone networks. Existing planners for hybrid (e.g., data and pipeline) parallelism largely optimize for throughput or device utilization, overlooking QoE, leading to severe resource inefficiency (e.g., unnecessary energy drain) or QoE violations under runtime dynamics.\n  We present Dora, a framework for QoE aware hybrid parallelism in distributed edge AI training and inference. Dora jointly optimizes heterogeneous computation, contention prone networks, and multi dimensional QoE objectives via three key mechanisms: (i) a heterogeneity aware model partitioner that determines and assigns model partitions across devices, forming a compact set of QoE compliant plans; (ii) a contention aware network scheduler that further refines these candidate plans by maximizing compute communication overlap; and (iii) a runtime adapter that adaptively composes multiple plans to maximize global efficiency while respecting overall QoEs. Across representative edge deployments, including smart homes, traffic analytics, and small edge clusters, Dora achieves 1.1--6.3 times faster execution and, alternatively, reduces energy consumption by 21--82 percent, all while maintaining QoE under runtime dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Dora\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684QoE\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u5e76\u884c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u533a\u3001\u7ade\u4e89\u611f\u77e5\u7f51\u7edc\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237QoE\u8981\u6c42\uff08\u5982\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff09\u6210\u4e3a\u9996\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u8d85\u8fc7\u5355\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u5e76\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6216\u8bbe\u5907\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86QoE\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u6216QoE\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002", "method": "Dora\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0QoE\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u5e76\u884c\uff1a1) \u5f02\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u533a\u5668\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5e76\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684QoE\u5408\u89c4\u8ba1\u5212\u96c6\uff1b2) \u7ade\u4e89\u611f\u77e5\u7f51\u7edc\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u901a\u4fe1\u91cd\u53e0\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5019\u9009\u8ba1\u5212\uff1b3) \u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u8ba1\u5212\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u6548\u7387\u540c\u65f6\u5c0a\u91cd\u6574\u4f53QoE\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\uff08\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5c0f\u578b\u8fb9\u7f18\u96c6\u7fa4\uff09\u4e2d\uff0cDora\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.1-6.3\u500d\u7684\u6267\u884c\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e21-82%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301QoE\u3002", "conclusion": "Dora\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u7684QoE\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5f02\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u7ade\u4e89\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u591a\u7ef4QoE\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This complements the observation of Capitaine and Donati-Martin (2018) that these distributions are not universal when $v$ is instead sufficiently localized.

While prior efforts leverage 1D representations like SELFIES to ensure molecular validity, they fail to fully exploit the rich chemical knowledge entangled within 1D models, leading to a disconnect between 1D syntactic generation and 3D geometric realization. To bridge this gap, we propose MolSculpt, a novel framework that \"sculpts\" 3D molecular geometries from chemical syntax. MolSculpt is built upon a frozen 1D molecular foundation model and a 3D molecular diffusion model. We introduce a set of learnable queries to extract inherent chemical knowledge from the foundation model, and a trainable projector then injects this cross-modal information into the conditioning space of the diffusion model to guide the 3D geometry generation. In this way, our model deeply integrates 1D latent chemical knowledge into the 3D generation process through end-to-end optimization.

We design and implement a proof-of-concept LLVM-based optimization pipeline for the SPDZ protocol that addresses these bottlenecks. Our front end accepts a subset of C with lightweight privacy annotations and lowers it to LLVM IR, allowing us to reuse mature analyses and transformations to automatically batch independent arithmetic operations. Our back end performs data-flow and control-flow analysis on the optimized IR to drive a non-blocking runtime scheduler that overlaps independent operations and aggressively overlaps communication with computation; when enabled, it can map batched operations to GPU kernels. This design preserves a low learning curve by using a mainstream language and hiding optimization and hardware-specific mechanics from programmers. We evaluate the system on controlled microbenchmarks against MP-SPDZ, focusing on online phase performance. Our CPU back end achieves up to 5.56 times speedup under intermediate and heavy algebraic workloads, shows strong scaling with thread count, and our GPU back end scales better as the input size increases. Overall, these results indicate that leveraging LLVM with protocol-aware scheduling is an effective architectural direction for extracting parallelism without sacrificing usability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLVM\u7684SPDZ\u534f\u8bae\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u6279\u5904\u7406\u3001\u975e\u963b\u585e\u8c03\u5ea6\u548cGPU\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u591a\u65b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5b89\u5168\u591a\u65b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff1a\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u7f16\u8bd1\u6808\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1LLVM\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1a\u524d\u7aef\u63a5\u53d7\u5e26\u9690\u79c1\u6807\u6ce8\u7684C\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u540e\u7aef\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u963b\u585e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301GPU\u5185\u6838\u6620\u5c04", "result": "CPU\u540e\u7aef\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u548c\u91cd\u5ea6\u4ee3\u6570\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad85.56\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0cGPU\u540e\u7aef\u968f\u8f93\u5165\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408LLVM\u548c\u534f\u8bae\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u662f\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u67b6\u6784\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u591a\u65b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848"}}

We derive latency and energy bounds demonstrating potential speedups of 10-100x for code iteration cycles. Our analysis shows that traditional GPU compilation provides 2-5x improvements through transfer elimination, neural compilation achieves 10-100x speedups via massive parallelism, and hybrid approaches offer practical deployment paths with guaranteed correctness.

However, extending classical methods such as policy iteration to this setting remains difficult; the output process is non-Markovian, making policy-improvement steps interdependent across stages. We introduce a new family of monotonically improving policy-iteration algorithms that alternate between single-stage output-based policy improvements and policy evaluations according to a prescribed periodic pattern. We show that this family admits optimal patterns that maximize a natural computational-efficiency index, and we identify the simplest pattern with minimal period. Building on this structure, we further develop a model-free variant that estimates values from data and learns memoryless policies directly.

However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule. The group abstraction also imposes a residency constraint, ensuring that massive model states remain cached in host memory to enable \"warm-star\" context switching. We evaluate RollMux on a production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs.

In this work, we introduce the linear constraint-driven clipping framework, a class of scalable and efficient methods designed to enhance the efficacy of NN verifiers. Under this framework, we develop two novel algorithms that efficiently utilize linear constraints to 1) reduce portions of the input space that are either verified or irrelevant to a subproblem in the context of branch-and-bound, and 2) directly improve intermediate bounds throughout the network. The process novelly leverages linear constraints that often arise from bound propagation methods and is general enough to also incorporate constraints from other sources. It efficiently handles linear constraints using a specialized GPU procedure that can scale to large neural networks without the use of expensive external solvers. Our verification procedure, Clip-and-Verify, consistently tightens bounds across multiple benchmarks and can significantly reduce the number of subproblems handled during BaB. We show that our clipping algorithms can be integrated with BaB-based verifiers such as $\u03b1,\u03b2$-CROWN, utilizing either the split constraints in activation-space BaB or the output constraints that denote the unverified input space.

This paper examines the interactional friction that emerges in modular Speech-to-Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation (S2S-RAG) pipelines. By analyzing a representative production system, we move beyond simple latency metrics to identify three recurring patterns of conversational breakdown: (1) Temporal Misalignment, where system delays violate user expectations of conversational rhythm; (2) Expressive Flattening, where the loss of paralinguistic cues leads to literal, inappropriate responses; and (3) Repair Rigidity, where architectural gating prevents users from correcting errors in real-time. Through system-level analysis, we demonstrate that these friction points should not be understood as defects or failures, but as structural consequences of a modular design that prioritizes control over fluidity. We conclude that building natural spoken AI is an infrastructure design challenge, requiring a shift from optimizing isolated components to carefully choreographing the seams between them.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u97f3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6a21\u5757\u5316S2S-RAG\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6469\u64e6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e09\u79cd\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5d29\u6e83\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8fd9\u662f\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5148\u63a7\u5236\u800c\u975e\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u97f3AI\u89c6\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bed\u97f3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e38\u611f\u89c9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u65ad\u88c2\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bed\u97f3\u5230\u8bed\u97f3\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6469\u64e6\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e09\u79cd\u53cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5d29\u6e83\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u3001\u8868\u8fbe\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u50f5\u5316\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6469\u64e6\u70b9\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5148\u63a7\u5236\u800c\u975e\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u540e\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u6838\u5fc3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6469\u64e6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a1)\u65f6\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d-\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fdd\u53cd\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8282\u594f\u7684\u671f\u671b\uff1b2)\u8868\u8fbe\u6241\u5e73\u5316-\u526f\u8bed\u8a00\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e22\u5931\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b57\u9762\u5316\u3001\u4e0d\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u56de\u5e94\uff1b3)\u4fee\u590d\u50f5\u5316-\u67b6\u6784\u95e8\u63a7\u963b\u6b62\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u662f\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u540e\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u97f3AI\u662f\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u5b64\u7acb\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8f6c\u5411\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7f16\u6392\u7ec4\u4ef6\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u3002\u6469\u64e6\u70b9\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5148\u63a7\u5236\u800c\u975e\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u7684\u5fc5\u7136\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u601d\u7ef4\u3002"}}

Existing distributed approximation techniques, such as pruning, often fail to fully mitigate the cost of exchanging numerous data packets in large network settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel enhancement to the distributed pruning method specifically designed to overcome this communication bottleneck. Our core contribution is a technique that leverages multi-packet messaging, allowing nodes to batch and transmit larger, consolidated data blocks. This approach significantly reduces the number of exchanged messages and minimizes data loss without compromising the accuracy of the centrality estimates. We demonstrate that our multi-packet approach substantially outperforms the original pruning technique in both message efficiency (fewer overall messages) and computation time, preserving the core approximation properties of the baseline method. While we observe a manageable trade-off in increased per-node memory usage and local overhead, our findings show that this is outweighed by the gains in communication efficiency, particularly for very large networks and complex packet structures.

However, current ECG models are trained under the assumption of clean and non-ambiguous annotations, which limits both the development and the meaningful evaluation of models under real-world conditions. Although Partial Label Learning (PLL) frameworks are designed to learn from ambiguous labels, their effectiveness in medical time-series domains, ECG in particular, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of PLL methods for ECG diagnosis. We adapt nine PLL algorithms to multi-label ECG diagnosis and evaluate them using a diverse set of clinically motivated ambiguity generation strategies, capturing both unstructured (e.g., random) and structured ambiguities (e.g., cardiologist-derived similarities, treatment relationships, and diagnostic taxonomies). Our experiments on the PTB-XL and Chapman datasets demonstrate that PLL methods vary substantially in their robustness to different types and degrees of ambiguity. Through extensive analysis, we identify key limitations of current PLL approaches in clinical settings and outline future directions for developing robust and clinically aligned ambiguity-aware learning frameworks for ECG diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u5728ECG\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e5d\u79cdPLL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cECG\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u53e0\u75c5\u75c7\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u6b67\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709ECG\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u6807\u7b7e\u5e72\u51c0\u65e0\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30", "method": "\u5c06\u4e5d\u79cd\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u9002\u914d\u5230\u591a\u6807\u7b7eECG\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6a21\u7cca\u5982\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u4e13\u5bb6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30", "result": "\u5728PTB-XL\u548cChapman\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540cPLL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f53\u524dPLL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411"}}

Although many devices include specialized accelerators (e.g., mobile GPUs), dynamic control-flow operators and unsupported kernels often fall back to CPU execution. Existing frameworks handle these fallbacks poorly, leaving CPU cores idle and causing high latency and memory spikes. We introduce Parallax, a framework that accelerates mobile DNN inference without model refactoring or custom operator implementations. Parallax first partitions the computation DAG to expose parallelism, then employs branch-aware memory management with dedicated arenas and buffer reuse to reduce runtime footprint. An adaptive scheduler executes branches according to device memory constraints, meanwhile, fine-grained subgraph control enables heterogeneous inference of dynamic models. By evaluating on five representative DNNs across three different mobile devices, Parallax achieves up to 46% latency reduction, maintains controlled memory overhead (26.5% on average), and delivers up to 30% energy savings compared with state-of-the-art frameworks, offering improvements aligned with the responsiveness demands of real-time mobile inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Parallax\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u79fb\u52a8\u7aefDNN\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u56fe\u5206\u533a\u3001\u5206\u652f\u611f\u77e5\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u52a0\u901f\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf46%\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u950026.5%\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u80fd\u801730%\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u65f6DNN\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5185\u6838\u5f80\u5f80\u56de\u9000\u5230CPU\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4CPU\u6838\u5fc3\u95f2\u7f6e\u3001\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5cf0\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u5206\u533a\u8ba1\u7b97DAG\u4ee5\u66b4\u9732\u5e76\u884c\u6027\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u5206\u652f\u611f\u77e5\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u548c\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u91cd\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff1b3) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u6839\u636e\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u7ea6\u675f\u6267\u884c\u5206\u652f\uff1b4) \u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b50\u56fe\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027DNN\u6a21\u578b\uff0cParallax\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u9ad846%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u63a7\u5236\u572826.5%\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u8282\u7701\u6700\u9ad830%\u3002", "conclusion": "Parallax\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u6784\u6216\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u7b97\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5c31\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u79fb\u52a8\u7aefDNN\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u79fb\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of inference time reasoning methods applied across both open-source and closed-source VLMs on different benchmarks. Our results reveal that while closed-source models consistently benefit from structured reasoning and iterative Self-Refinement, open-source VLMs show inconsistent behavior: external verification provides the most reliable gains, whereas iterative refinement often degrades performance. We further find that the effectiveness of TTS is dataset-dependent, yielding clear improvements on multi-step reasoning tasks but offering only limited gains on perception-focused benchmarks. These findings demonstrate that TTS is not a universal solution and must be tailored to both model capabilities and task characteristics, motivating future work on adaptive TTS strategies and multimodal reward models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\uff08TTS\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\uff0c\u800c\u5f00\u6e90VLM\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14TTS\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\uff08TTS\uff09\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30TTS\u5728\u4e0d\u540cVLM\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5f00\u6e90VLM\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u800c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1bTTS\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6539\u5584\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u5bfc\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u589e\u76ca\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "TTS\u5e76\u975e\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u5236\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94TTS\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Multi-objective Bayesian optimization is a promising solution for such expensive, black-box problems: it fits probabilistic surrogates and selects new designs via an acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation. In practice, it requires tailored choices of surrogate and acquisition that rarely transfer to the next problem, is myopic when multi-step planning is often required, and adds refitting overhead, particularly in parallel or time-sensitive loops. We present TAMO, a fully amortized, universal policy for multi-objective black-box optimization. TAMO uses a transformer architecture that operates across varying input and objective dimensions, enabling pretraining on diverse corpora and transfer to new problems without retraining: at test time, the pretrained model proposes the next design with a single forward pass. We pretrain the policy with reinforcement learning to maximize cumulative hypervolume improvement over full trajectories, conditioning on the entire query history to approximate the Pareto frontier. Across synthetic benchmarks and real tasks, TAMO produces fast proposals, reducing proposal time by 50-1000x versus alternatives while matching or improving Pareto quality under tight evaluation budgets. These results show that transformers can perform multi-objective optimization entirely in-context, eliminating per-task surrogate fitting and acquisition engineering, and open a path to foundation-style, plug-and-play optimizers for scientific discovery workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "TAMO\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u644a\u9500\u5f0f\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u95ee\u9898\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6bcf\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5b9a\u5236\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u8fd1\u89c6\u7684\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u62df\u5408\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTAMO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u53d8\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7d2f\u79ef\u8d85\u4f53\u79ef\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u7b56\u7565\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574\u67e5\u8be2\u5386\u53f2\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u53ea\u9700\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u6848", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cTAMO\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u6848\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb50-1000\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5339\u914d\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5185\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316", "conclusion": "Transformer\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5185\u6267\u884c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u6bcf\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u548c\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5f0f\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84"}}

However, the traditional requirement for manually assigned or centrally coordinated worker IDs introduces significant friction in modern container-orchestrated environments (e.g., Kubernetes), where workloads are ephemeral and autoscaled. In such systems, maintaining stable worker identities requires complex stateful sets or external coordination services (e.g., ZooKeeper), negating the operational benefits of stateless microservices.\n  This paper presents a cloud-agnostic, container-native ID generation protocol that eliminates the dependency on explicit worker IDs. By deriving node uniqueness deterministically from ephemeral network properties - specifically the container's private IPv4 address - the proposed method removes the need for centralized coordination. We introduce a modified bit-allocation scheme (1-41-16-6) that accommodates 16 bits of network-derived entropy while preserving strict monotonicity. We validate the approach across AWS, GCP, and Azure environments. Evaluation results demonstrate that while the design has a theoretical single-node ceiling of approximately 64,000 TPS, in practical microservice deployments the network I/O dominates latency, resulting in end-to-end performance (approximately 31,000 TPS on a 3-node cluster) comparable to classic stateful generators while offering effectively unbounded horizontal scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0fworker ID\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fID\u751f\u6210\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bb9\u5668\u79c1\u6709IPv4\u5730\u5740\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8282\u70b9\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u534f\u8c03\u9700\u6c42", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSnowflake\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fID\u751f\u6210\u5668\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u914d\u6216\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u534f\u8c03\u7684worker ID\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5bb9\u5668\u7f16\u6392\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982Kubernetes\uff09\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6469\u64e6\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u662f\u77ed\u6682\u4e14\u81ea\u52a8\u4f38\u7f29\u7684\u3002\u7ef4\u62a4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684worker\u8eab\u4efd\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u96c6\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u534f\u8c03\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u8fdd\u80cc\u4e86\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e91\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u5bb9\u5668\u539f\u751f\u7684ID\u751f\u6210\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5bb9\u5668\u7684\u79c1\u6709IPv4\u5730\u5740\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u5bfc\u8282\u70b9\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0fworker ID\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u4f4d\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\uff081-41-16-6\uff09\uff0c\u5bb9\u7eb316\u4f4d\u7f51\u7edc\u884d\u751f\u71b5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683c\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u3002\u5728AWS\u3001GCP\u548cAzure\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u7ea664,000 TPS\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5355\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f51\u7edcI/O\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\uff083\u8282\u70b9\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7ea631,000 TPS\uff09\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u65e0\u754c\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u6210\u529f\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fID\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0fworker ID\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5bb9\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u5c5e\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5bb9\u5668\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

While traditional optimization solvers provide optimal solutions, their computational cost becomes prohibitive for large-scale systems requiring frequent recalculations. Machine learning approaches offer promise for acceleration but often struggle with constraint satisfaction and cost optimality. We present a novel two-stage learning framework that combines physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Continuous Flow Matching (CFM) for solving DC-OPF problems. Our approach embeds fundamental physical principles--including economic dispatch optimality conditions, Kirchhoff's laws, and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) complementarity conditions--directly into the training objectives. The first stage trains a GNN to produce feasible initial solutions by learning from physics-informed losses that encode power system constraints. The second stage employs CFM, a simulation-free continuous normalizing flow technique, to refine these solutions toward optimality through learned vector field regression. Evaluated on the IEEE 30-bus system across five load scenarios ranging from 70\\% to 130\\% nominal load, our method achieves near-optimal solutions with cost gaps below 0.1\\% for nominal loads and below 3\\% for extreme conditions, while maintaining 100\\% feasibility. Our framework bridges the gap between fast but approximate neural network predictions and optimal but slow numerical solvers, offering a practical solution for modern power systems with high renewable penetration requiring frequent dispatch updates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u6c42\u89e3\u76f4\u6d41\u6700\u4f18\u6f6e\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301100%\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u9891\u7e41\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u5feb\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u5feb\u901f\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u521d\u59cb\u89e3\uff0c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7f16\u7801\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8c03\u5ea6\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u57fa\u5c14\u970d\u592b\u5b9a\u5f8b\u548cKKT\u4e92\u8865\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u56de\u5f52\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEEE 30\u8282\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u76845\u4e2a\u8d1f\u8377\u573a\u666f\uff0870%-130%\u989d\u5b9a\u8d1f\u8377\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff1a\u989d\u5b9a\u8d1f\u8377\u4e0b\u6210\u672c\u5dee\u8ddd\u4f4e\u4e8e0.1%\uff0c\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f4e\u4e8e3%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301100%\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6162\u901f\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u67b6\u8d77\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u8c03\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the current practice of retraining a separate model for each camera suffers from high compute and communication costs, making it unscalable. We present ECCO, a new video analytics framework designed for resource-efficient continuous learning. The key insight is that the data drift, which necessitates model retraining, often shows temporal and spatial correlations across nearby cameras. By identifying cameras that experience similar drift and retraining a shared model for them, ECCO can substantially reduce the associated compute and communication costs. Specifically, ECCO introduces: (i) a lightweight grouping algorithm that dynamically forms and updates camera groups; (ii) a GPU allocator that dynamically assigns GPU resources across different groups to improve retraining accuracy and ensure fairness; and (iii) a transmission controller at each camera that configures frame sampling and coordinates bandwidth sharing with other cameras based on its assigned GPU resources. We conducted extensive evaluations on three distinctive datasets for two vision tasks.

In this paper, we study a new and challenging setting of fairness-regularized smoothed online convex optimization with switching costs. First, to highlight the fundamental challenges introduced by the long-term fairness regularizer evaluated based on the entire sequence of actions, we prove that even without switching costs, no online algorithms can possibly achieve a sublinear regret or finite competitive ratio compared to the offline optimal algorithm as the problem episode length $T$ increases. Then, we propose FairOBD (Fairness-regularized Online Balanced Descent), which reconciles the tension between minimizing the hitting cost, switching cost, and fairness cost. Concretely, FairOBD decomposes the long-term fairness cost into a sequence of online costs by introducing an auxiliary variable and then leverages the auxiliary variable to regularize the online actions for fair outcomes. Based on a new approach to account for switching costs, we prove that FairOBD offers a worst-case asymptotic competitive ratio against a novel benchmark -- the optimal offline algorithm with parameterized constraints -- by considering $T\\to\\infty$. Finally, we run trace-driven experiments of dynamic computing resource provisioning for socially responsible AI inference to empirically evaluate FairOBD, showing that FairOBD can effectively reduce the total fairness-regularized cost and better promote fair outcomes compared to existing baseline solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faFairOBD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e73\u6ed1\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u53d8\u91cf\u5c06\u957f\u671f\u516c\u5e73\u6210\u672c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u662f\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u8003\u8651\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u672a\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e73\u6ed1\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u547d\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5207\u6362\u6210\u672c\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFairOBD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u957f\u671f\u516c\u5e73\u6210\u672c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u7ebf\u6210\u672c\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u53d8\u91cf\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5207\u6362\u6210\u672c\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u9488\u5bf9\u79bb\u7ebf\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u5373\u4f7f\u65e0\u5207\u6362\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u6216\u6709\u9650\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\uff1b2\uff09FairOBD\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e10\u8fd1\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cFairOBD\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u603b\u516c\u5e73\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fc3\u8fdb\u516c\u5e73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "FairOBD\u7b97\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u8c03\u548c\u4e86\u547d\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5207\u6362\u6210\u672c\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e73\u6ed1\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

These hyperedges enable fully concurrent, leaderless intra- and inter-hyperedge payments through verifiable, proposer-ordered DAG updates, offering significantly greater flexibility and concurrency than prior designs.\n  Our implementation on a 150-node network demonstrates a transaction success rate of approximately 94% without HTLC expiry or routing failures, highlighting the robustness of H-MPCs.", "AI": {"tldr": "H-MPCs\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u56fe\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u652f\u4ed8\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4f53\u8d44\u91d1\u8d85\u8fb9\u66ff\u4ee3\u53cc\u8fb9\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u3001\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u7684\u94fe\u4e0b\u652f\u4ed8\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u788e\u7247\u5316\u548c\u901a\u9053\u8017\u5c3d\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u652f\u4ed8\u901a\u9053\u7f51\u7edc\u5b58\u5728\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff08\u8d44\u91d1\u9501\u5b9a\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u901a\u9053\u65e0\u6cd5\u590d\u7528\uff09\u548c\u901a\u9053\u8017\u5c3d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8def\u7531\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u901a\u9053\u65b9\u6848\u4f9d\u8d56\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u6216\u534f\u8c03\u8005\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5355\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u4e14\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u652f\u4ed8\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u56fe\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u652f\u4ed8\u901a\u9053\uff08H-MPCs\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u96c6\u4f53\u8d44\u91d1\u7684\u8d85\u8fb9\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u53cc\u8fb9\u901a\u9053\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u5e76\u53d1\u3001\u65e0\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u7684\u8d85\u8fb9\u5185\u548c\u8d85\u8fb9\u95f4\u652f\u4ed8\u3002", "result": "\u5728150\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7ea694%\uff0c\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709HTLC\u8fc7\u671f\u6216\u8def\u7531\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86H-MPCs\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "H-MPCs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u5e76\u53d1\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u652f\u4ed8\u901a\u9053\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u788e\u7247\u5316\u548c\u901a\u9053\u8017\u5c3d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5355\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u3002"}}

We evaluate the VL against Sinusoidal Representation Networks (SIRENs) on homogeneous elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Our results demonstrate that the VL achieves machine precision ($\\text{MSE} \\approx 10^{-33}$) on exact reconstruction tasks and exhibits superior stability in the presence of incoherent sensor noise ($\\text{MSE} \\approx 0.03$), effectively acting as a physics-informed spectral filter.

However, city-level data often exists in heterogeneous formats, collected independently by local agencies with diverse objectives and standards. Despite their numerous, wide-ranging, and uniformly consumable nature, national-level datasets exhibit significant heterogeneity and multi-modality. This research proposes a heterogeneous data pipeline that performs cross-domain data fusion over time-varying, spatial-varying and spatial-varying time-series datasets. We aim to address complex urban problems across multiple domains and localities by harnessing the rich information over 50 data sources. Specifically, our data-learning module integrates homophily from spatial-varying dataset into graph-learning, embedding information of various localities into models. We demonstrate the generalizability and flexibility of the framework through five real-world observations using a variety of publicly accessible datasets (e.g., ride-share, traffic crash, and crime reports) collected from multiple cities. The results show that our proposed framework demonstrates strong predictive performance while requiring minimal reconfiguration when transferred to new localities or domains.

While recent methods excel at learning sparse coordination graphs-determining who communicates with whom-they do not address what information should be transmitted under hard bandwidth constraints. We study this bandwidth-limited regime and show that naive dimensionality reduction consistently degrades coordination performance. Hard bandwidth constraints force selective encoding, but deterministic projections lack mechanisms to control how compression occurs. We introduce Bandwidth-constrained Variational Message Encoding (BVME), a lightweight module that treats messages as samples from learned Gaussian posteriors regularized via KL divergence to an uninformative prior. BVME's variational framework provides principled, tunable control over compression strength through interpretable hyperparameters, directly constraining the representations used for decision-making. Across SMACv1, SMACv2, and MPE benchmarks, BVME achieves comparable or superior performance while using 67--83% fewer message dimensions, with gains most pronounced on sparse graphs where message quality critically impacts coordination.

The natural progression has been toward larger, more comprehensive and challenging collections of static problems, an approach that inadvertently constrains the kinds of advances we can measure and incentivize. To address this limitation, we argue for progress-oriented benchmarks, problem environments whose objectives are themselves the core targets of scientific progress, so that achieving state of the art on the benchmark advances the field. As a introductory step, we instantiate an environment based on the NanoGPT speedrun. The environment standardizes a dataset slice, a reference model and training harness, and rich telemetry, with run-time verification and anti-gaming checks. Evaluation centers on the scientific delta achieved: best-attained loss and the efficiency frontier. Using this environment, we achieve a new state-of-the-art training time, improving upon the previous record by 3 seconds, and qualitatively observe the emergence of novel algorithmic ideas. Moreover, comparisons between models and agents remain possible, but they are a means, not the end; the benchmark's purpose is to catalyze reusable improvements to the language modeling stack. With this release, the overarching goal is to seed a community shift from static problem leaderboards to test-time research on open-ended yet measurable scientific problems.

Like any machine learning problem, the choice of activation function influences the characteristics and performance of the solution obtained from physics-informed training. Several studies have compared common activation functions on benchmark differential equations, and have unanimously found that the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is outperformed by competitors such as the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and swish activation functions. In this work, we diagnose the poor performance of ReLU on physics-informed machine learning problems. While it is well-known that the piecewise linear form of ReLU prevents it from being used on second-order differential equations, we show that ReLU fails even on variational problems involving only first derivatives. We identify the cause of this failure as second derivatives of the activation, which are taken not in the formulation of the loss, but in the process of training. Namely, we show that automatic differentiation in PyTorch fails to characterize derivatives of discontinuous fields, which causes the gradient of the physics-informed loss to be mis-specified, thus explaining the poor performance of ReLU.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bca\u65ad\u4e86ReLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u573a\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5f71\u54cd\u89e3\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eReLU\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982sigmoid\u3001tanh\u548cswish\u7b49\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bca\u65adReLU\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790ReLU\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u4ec5\u6d89\u53ca\u4e00\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u5728PyTorch\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u573a\u5bfc\u6570\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0ReLU\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u5176\u4e8c\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5bfc\u6570\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u516c\u5f0f\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002PyTorch\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u573a\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u88ab\u9519\u8bef\u6307\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "ReLU\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u5904\u7406\u5176\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8fd9\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48ReLU\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5982\u5176\u4ed6\u5e73\u6ed1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u3002"}}

While conventional dememorization techniques, such as regularization and data filtering, limit overfitting to specific training examples, they fail to systematically prevent the internalization of prohibited concept-level features. Simply discarding all images containing a sensitive feature wastes invaluable training data, necessitating a method for selective unlearning at the concept level.\n  To address this, we introduce a Gradient Projection Framework designed to enforce a stringent requirement of concept-level feature exclusion. Our defense operates during backpropagation by systematically identifying and excising training signals aligned with embeddings of prohibited attributes. Specifically, we project each gradient update onto the orthogonal complement of the sensitive feature's embedding space, thereby zeroing out its influence on the model's weights. Our method integrates seamlessly into standard diffusion model training pipelines and complements existing defenses. We analyze our method against an adversary aiming for feature extraction. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework drastically reduces memorization while rigorously preserving generation quality and semantic fidelity. By reframing memorization control as selective learning, our approach establishes a new paradigm for IP-safe and privacy-preserving generative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u6d88\u9664\u654f\u611f\u6982\u5ff5\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u53bb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff09\u53ea\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5316\u7981\u6b62\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u4e22\u5f03\u5305\u542b\u654f\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6240\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u4f1a\u6d6a\u8d39\u5b9d\u8d35\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u4e0e\u7981\u6b62\u5c5e\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u654f\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u8865\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6d88\u9664\u8be5\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e92\u8865\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e25\u683c\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3aIP\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548cIP\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our method introduces a reversible soft-freeze mechanism that temporarily suspends key-value (KV) updates for low-importance tokens identified within a sliding attention window. Unlike eviction-based approaches that permanently discard context, ASR-KF-EGR preserves all tokens in off-GPU storage and restores them on demand.

To reduce catastrophic forgetting, TAME uses a replay buffer that stores representative samples and embeddings from previous tasks and reuses them during training. An attention mechanism further prioritizes the most relevant stored information for each prediction.

In contrast to previous theories of ICL relying on toy models and data settings, recently it has been shown that an abstraction of a transformer block can be seen as implicitly updating the weights of its feedforward network according to the context (Dherin et al., 2025). Here, we provide a simple generalisation of this result for (i) all sequence positions beyond the last, (ii) any transformer block beyond the first, and (iii) more realistic residual blocks including layer normalisation. We empirically verify our theory on simple in-context linear regression tasks and investigate the relationship between the implicit updates related to different tokens within and between blocks.

We present the \\textbf{first application of SAEs to the 3D domain}, analyzing the features used by a state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction VAE applied to 53k 3D models from the Objaverse dataset. We observe that the network encodes discrete rather than continuous features, leading to our key finding: \\textbf{such models approximate a discrete state space, driven by phase-like transitions from feature activations}. Through this state transition framework, we address three otherwise unintuitive behaviors -- the inclination of the reconstruction model towards positional encoding representations, the sigmoidal behavior of reconstruction loss from feature ablation, and the bimodality in the distribution of phase transition points. This final observation suggests the model \\textbf{redistributes the interference caused by superposition to prioritize the saliency of different features}.

Their potential exposure to external world makes them susceptible to cyber-attacks. Existing detection methods against controller logic attacks use either specification-based or learnt models. However, specification-based models require experts' manual efforts or access to PLC's source code, while machine learning-based models often fall short of providing explanation for their decisions. We design SRLR -- a it Symbolic Regression based Logic Recovery} solution to identify the logic of a PLC based only on its inputs and outputs. The recovered logic is used to generate explainable rules for detecting controller logic attacks. SRLR enhances the latest deep symbolic regression methods using the following ICS-specific properties: (1) some important ICS control logic is best represented in frequency domain rather than time domain; (2) an ICS controller can operate in multiple modes, each using different logic, where mode switches usually do not happen frequently; (3) a robust controller usually filters out outlier inputs as ICS sensor data can be noisy; and (4) with the above factors captured, the degree of complexity of the formulas is reduced, making effective search possible. Thanks to these enhancements, SRLR consistently outperforms all existing methods in a variety of ICS settings that we evaluate. In terms of the recovery accuracy, SRLR's gain can be as high as 39% in some challenging environment. We also evaluate SRLR on a distribution grid containing hundreds of voltage regulators, demonstrating its stability in handling large-scale, complex systems with varied configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "SRLR\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u7684PLC\u903b\u8f91\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u903b\u8f91\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528ICS\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe39%", "motivation": "PLC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6613\u53d7\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u52a8\u5de5\u4f5c\u6216\u8bbf\u95ee\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51b3\u7b56\u89e3\u91ca\u6027", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1SRLR\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6062\u590d\uff09\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8ePLC\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5229\u7528ICS\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u6700\u65b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u8981\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u5728\u9891\u57df\u8868\u793a\u66f4\u4f73\uff1b2\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fd0\u884c\uff1b3\uff09\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5f02\u5e38\u8f93\u5165\uff1b4\uff09\u964d\u4f4e\u516c\u5f0f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6", "result": "SRLR\u5728\u5404\u79cdICS\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad839%\uff0c\u5728\u5305\u542b\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u7535\u538b\u8c03\u8282\u5668\u7684\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "conclusion": "SRLR\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528ICS\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86PLC\u903b\u8f91\u6062\u590d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u903b\u8f91\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf"}}

Quantum error correction (QEC) is vital for handling qubits, which are vulnerable to external noise. In QEC, actual errors are predicted from the results of syndrome measurements by stabilizer generators, in place of making direct measurements of the data qubits. Here, we propose Quantum Golay code Error Correction (QGEC), a QEC method using Golay code, which is an efficient coding method in classical information theory. We investigated our method's ability in decoding calculations with the Transformer. We evaluated the accuracy of the decoder in a code space defined by the generative polynomials with three different weights sets and three noise models with different correlations of bit-flip error and phase-flip error. Furthermore, under a noise model following a discrete uniform distribution, we compared the decoding performance of Transformer decoders with identical architectures trained respectively on Golay and toric codes. The results showed that the noise model with the smaller correlation gave better accuracy, while the weights of the generative polynomials had little effect on the accuracy of the decoder. In addition, they showed that Golay code requiring 23 data qubits and having a code distance of 7 achieved higher decoding accuracy than toric code which requiring 50 data qubits and having a code distance of 5. This suggests that implementing quantum error correction using a Transformer may enable the Golay code to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation more efficiently.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528Golay\u7801\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5QGEC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0bGolay\u7801\u6bd4toric\u7801\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\uff0c\u4f46\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6613\u53d7\u5916\u90e8\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519(QEC)\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u5143\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9645\u9519\u8bef\u3002Golay\u7801\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e2d\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQuantum Golay code Error Correction (QGEC)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Golay\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u3002\u91c7\u7528Transformer\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u7531\u751f\u6210\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6743\u91cd\u96c6\u5408\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u7279\u7ffb\u8f6c\u9519\u8bef\u4e0e\u76f8\u4f4d\u7ffb\u8f6c\u9519\u8bef\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u76f8\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684Transformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728Golay\u7801\u548ctoric\u7801\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "1. \u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8d8a\u5c0f\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8d8a\u597d\uff1b2. \u751f\u6210\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5f88\u5c0f\uff1b3.

Effective battery health management is essential for battery system safety, cost-efficiency, and sustainability. In this paper, we propose Pace, a physics-aware attentive temporal convolutional network for battery health estimation. Pace integrates raw sensor measurements with battery physics features derived from the equivalent circuit model. We develop three battery-specific modules, including dilated temporal blocks for efficient temporal encoding, chunked attention blocks for context modeling, and a dual-head output block for fusing short- and long-term battery degradation patterns. Together, the modules enable Pace to predict battery health accurately and efficiently in various battery usage conditions.

Traditional core loss modeling methods have limitations in prediction accuracy. To advance this field, the IEEE Power Electronics Society launched the MagNet Challenge in 2023, the first international competition focused on data-driven power electronics design methods, aiming to uncover complex loss patterns in magnetic components through a data-driven paradigm. Although purely data-driven models demonstrate strong fitting performance, their interpretability and cross-distribution generalization capabilities remain limited. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid model, SEPI-TFPNet, which integrates empirical models with deep learning. The physical-prior submodule employs a spectral entropy discrimination mechanism to select the most suitable empirical model under different excitation waveforms. The data-driven submodule incorporates convolutional neural networks, multi-head attention mechanisms, and bidirectional long short-term memory networks to extract flux-density time-series features. An adaptive feature fusion module is introduced to improve multimodal feature interaction and integration. Using the MagNet dataset containing various magnetic materials, this paper evaluates the proposed method and compares it with 21 representative models from the 2023 challenge and three advanced methods from 2024-2025.

While steering these policies with reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising mechanism for fine-tuning beyond demonstration data, directly applying standard (non-equivariant) RL can be sample-inefficient and unstable, as it ignores the symmetries that EDPs are designed to exploit. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the diffusion process of an EDP is equivariant, which in turn induces a group-invariant latent-noise MDP that is well-suited for equivariant diffusion steering. Building on this theory, we introduce a principled symmetry-aware steering framework and compare standard, equivariant, and approximately equivariant RL strategies through comprehensive experiments across tasks with varying degrees of symmetry. While we identify the practical boundaries of strict equivariance under symmetry breaking, we show that exploiting symmetry during the steering process yields substantial benefits-enhancing sample efficiency, preventing value divergence, and achieving strong policy improvements even when EDPs are trained from extremely limited demonstrations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b49\u53d8\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u7b49\u53d8\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\uff08\u975e\u7b49\u53d8\uff09\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u5ffd\u7565\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u7b49\u53d8\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u9002\u5408\u7b49\u53d8\u6269\u6563\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7fa4\u4e0d\u53d8\u6f5c\u5728\u566a\u58f0MDP\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u7b49\u53d8\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u53d8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u597d\u5904\uff1a\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9632\u6b62\u4ef7\u503c\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u6781\u5176\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b49\u53d8\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for trust prediction, owing to their ability to learn expressive node representations that capture intricate trust relationships within a network. However, current GNN-based trust prediction models face several limitations: (i) Most of them fail to capture trust dynamicity, leading to questionable inferences. (ii) They rarely consider the heterogeneous nature of real-world networks, resulting in a loss of rich semantics. (iii) None of them support context-awareness, a basic property of trust, making prediction results coarse-grained.\n  To this end, we propose CAT, the first Context-Aware GNN-based Trust prediction model that supports trust dynamicity and accurately represents real-world heterogeneity. CAT consists of a graph construction layer, an embedding layer, a heterogeneous attention layer, and a prediction layer. It handles dynamic graphs using continuous-time representations and captures temporal information through a time encoding function. To model graph heterogeneity and leverage semantic information, CAT employs a dual attention mechanism that identifies the importance of different node types and nodes within each type. For context-awareness, we introduce a new notion of meta-paths to extract contextual features. By constructing context embeddings and integrating a context-aware aggregator, CAT can predict both context-aware trust and overall trust. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CAT outperforms five groups of baselines in trust prediction, while exhibiting strong scalability to large-scale graphs and robustness against both trust-oriented and GNN-oriented attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAT\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u4fe1\u4efb\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5GNN\u4fe1\u4efb\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u3001\u53cc\u91cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e94\u7ec4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\uff1a1) \u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4fe1\u4efb\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff1b2) \u5ffd\u7565\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff1b3) \u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u8fd9\u4e00\u4fe1\u4efb\u57fa\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c97\u7cd9\u3002", "method": "CAT\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5c42\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u51fd\u6570\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u56fe\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff08\u8282\u70b9\u7c7b\u578b\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u5185\u8282\u70b9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff09\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCAT\u5728\u4fe1\u4efb\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e94\u7ec4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u7684\u5f3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u4fe1\u4efb\u5bfc\u5411\u548cGNN\u5bfc\u5411\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CAT\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u4fe1\u4efb\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u793a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684GNN\u4fe1\u4efb\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These techniques have many applications in real-world scenarios, for example, protecting personal privacy in social networks and understanding camouflage patterns in transaction networks. To simulate interactive attack and defense behaviors, we further propose a game-theoretic framework, called CD-GAME.

The CD-GAME models the mutual influence and feedback mechanisms between the attacker and the defender, revealing the dynamic evolutionary process of the game. Both players dynamically update their strategies until they reach the Nash equilibrium. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack and defense methods, and both outperform existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, CD-GAME provides valuable insights for understanding interactive attack and defense scenarios in community detection problems.

However, safety alignment under Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from forgetting learned general abilities, which is also known as the alignment tax. To address this issue, we introduce Null-Space constrained Policy Optimization (NSPO), a novel RL framework for LLM safety alignment while preserving their core abilities. The safety policy gradients are geometrically projected into the null space of general tasks, thereby mitigating the safety alignment tax.

Our findings provide actionable guidelines for maximizing the value extracted from expert trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPlasticity-Ceiling\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u786e\u7acbSFT-then-RL\u4e3a\u6700\u4f73\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u6269\u5c55\u6307\u5357", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2dSFT\u548cRL\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6700\u4f18\u5229\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u8df5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPlasticity-Ceiling\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840SFT\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u540e\u7eedRL\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1", "result": "\u786e\u7acbSFT-then-RL\u987a\u5e8f\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e3a\u6700\u4f73\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u6269\u5c55\u6307\u5357\uff1a1)\u5728SFT\u7a33\u5b9a\u6216\u8f7b\u5ea6\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u9636\u6bb5\u8f6c\u5411RL\uff1b2)\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u51b3\u5b9a\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u96be\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u4e58\u6570\uff1b3)SFT\u6700\u5c0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6307\u6807", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ef7\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2dSFT\u548cRL\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u673a\u5236\u95ee\u9898"}}

The learnable physics integration captures large-scale, deterministic physical evolution, and transforms key physical parameters (e.g., diffusion coefficients) into learnable parameters, enabling the model to autonomously optimize its physical core via end-to-end training. Concurrently, a deep neural network learns to correct for subgrid-scale processes and discretization errors not captured by the physics model. Both components work in synergy, with their outputs integrated by a unified ODE solver.

We propose Co-TSFA (Contrastive Time Series Forecasting with Anomalies), a regularization framework that learns when to ignore anomalies and when to respond. Co-TSFA generates input-only and input-output augmentations to model forecast-irrelevant and forecast-relevant anomalies, and introduces a latent-output alignment loss that ties representation changes to forecast changes. This encourages invariance to irrelevant perturbations while preserving sensitivity to meaningful distributional shifts. Experiments on the Traffic and Electricity benchmarks, as well as on a real-world cash-demand dataset, demonstrate that Co-TSFA improves performance under anomalous conditions while maintaining accuracy on normal data.

Generative recommendation (GR) integrates LLMs to enhance the understanding of long user-item sequences. Despite employing attention-based architectures, GR's workload differs markedly from that of LLM serving. GR typically processes long prompt while producing short, fixed-length outputs, yet the computational cost of each decode phase is especially high due to the large beam width. In addition, since the beam search involves a vast item space, the sorting overhead becomes particularly time-consuming. We propose xGR, a GR-oriented serving system that meets strict low-latency requirements under highconcurrency scenarios. First, xGR unifies the processing of prefill and decode phases through staged computation and separated KV cache.

However, raw sensor streams are often imbalanced and contain significant redundancy, meaning that not all data points contribute equally to model generalization. In this paper, we show that, in some cases, \"less is more\" when considering datasets. We do this by reframing the data selection problem: rather than tuning model hyperparameters, we fix the model and optimize the composition of the training data itself. We introduce a framework for discovering the optimal \"training diet\" from a large, unlabeled time series corpus. Our framework first uses a large-scale encoder and k-means clustering to partition the dataset into distinct, behaviorally consistent clusters. These clusters represent the fundamental 'ingredients' available for training. We then employ the Optuna optimization framework to search the high-dimensional space of possible data mixtures. For each trial, Optuna proposes a specific sampling ratio for each cluster, and a new training set is constructed based on this recipe. A smaller target model is then trained and evaluated. Our experiments reveal that this data-centric search consistently discovers data mixtures that yield models with significantly higher performance compared to baselines trained on the entire dataset.

MKL seeks an optimal linear combination of base kernels that maximizes a generalized performance measure under a regularization constraint. Various norms have been used to regularize the kernel weights, including $l1$, $l2$ and $lp$, as well as the \"elastic-net\" penalty, which combines $l1$- and $l2$-norm to promote both sparsity and the selection of correlated kernels. This property makes elastic-net regularized MKL (ENMKL) especially valuable when model interpretability is critical and kernels capture correlated information, such as in neuroimaging. Previous ENMKL methods have followed a two-stage procedure: fix kernel weights, train a support vector machine (SVM) with the weighted kernel, and then update the weights via gradient descent, cutting-plane methods, or surrogate functions. Here, we introduce an alternative ENMKL formulation that yields a simple analytical update for the kernel weights. We derive explicit algorithms for both SVM and kernel ridge regression (KRR) under this framework, and implement them in the open-source Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo). We evaluate these ENMKL algorithms against $l1$-norm MKL and against SVM (or KRR) trained on the unweighted sum of kernels across three neuroimaging applications. Our results show that ENMKL matches or outperforms $l1$-norm MKL in all tasks and only underperforms standard SVM in one scenario. Crucially, ENMKL produces sparser, more interpretable models by selectively weighting correlated kernels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u591a\u6838\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u66f4\u65b0\u6838\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f39\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u591a\u6838\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u5f39\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u591a\u6838\u5b66\u4e60\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6838\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u548c\u6838\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u522b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728PRoNTo\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f39\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u591a\u6838\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u90fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u4f18\u4e8el1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u591a\u6838\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7565\u900a\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u591a\u6838\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6838\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u91ca\u76f8\u5173\u6838\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Current models, however, are often trained using a mask-and-reconstruct objective on small brain regions. This focus on low-level information leads to representations that are sensitive to noise and temporal fluctuations, necessitating extensive fine-tuning for downstream tasks. We introduce Brain-Semantoks, a self-supervised framework designed specifically to learn abstract representations of brain dynamics. Its architecture is built on two core innovations: a semantic tokenizer that aggregates noisy regional signals into robust tokens representing functional networks, and a self-distillation objective that enforces representational stability across time.

Using LIBERO demonstrations, AAS produces a validated dataset of 2,124 atomic segments labeled with action type, temporal span, and confidence. A stronger segmenter (Gemini 2.5 Pro) closely matches planner-defined plans and remains robust under keyframe jitter, while smaller models perform worse on multi-object tasks.

We analyze nonlinear models with the logistic loss and show that the steps of GD reduce to those of generalized perceptron algorithms (Rosenblatt, 1958), providing a new perspective on the dynamics. This reduction yields significantly simpler algorithmic steps, which we analyze using classical linear algebra tools. Using these tools, we demonstrate on a minimalistic example that the nonlinearity in a two-layer model can provably yield a faster iteration complexity $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{d})$ compared to $\u03a9(d)$ achieved by linear models, where $d$ is the number of features.

However, interpretability requires both sensible linguistic partitions and small rule-base sizes, which are not guaranteed by many existing fuzzy rule-mining algorithms. Evolutionary approaches can produce high-quality models but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while neural-based methods like ANFIS have problems retaining linguistic interpretations. In this work, we propose an adaptation of classical tree-based splitting algorithms from crisp rules to fuzzy trees, combining the computational efficiency of greedy algoritms with the interpretability advantages of fuzzy logic. This approach achieves interpretable linguistic partitions and substantially improves running time compared to evolutionary-based approaches while maintaining competitive predictive performance. Our experiments on tabular classification benchmarks proof that our method achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers with significantly lower computational cost and produces more interpretable rule bases with constrained complexity.

However, existing research communities address these challenges in isolation. Continual Learning (CL) focuses on long-term retention and mitigating catastrophic forgetting, often without strict real-time constraints. Stream Learning (SL) emphasizes rapid, efficient adaptation to high-frequency data streams, but typically neglects forgetting. Recent efforts have tried to combine these paradigms, yet no clear algorithmic overlap exists. We argue that large in-context tabular models (LTMs) provide a natural bridge for Streaming Continual Learning (SCL). In our view, unbounded streams should be summarized on-the-fly into compact sketches that can be consumed by LTMs. This recovers the classical SL motivation of compressing massive streams with fixed-size guarantees, while simultaneously aligning with the experience-replay desiderata of CL. To clarify this bridge, we show how the SL and CL communities implicitly adopt a divide-to-conquer strategy to manage the tension between plasticity (performing well on the current distribution) and stability (retaining past knowledge), while also imposing a minimal complexity constraint that motivates diversification (avoiding redundancy in what is stored) and retrieval (re-prioritizing past information when needed). Within this perspective, we propose structuring SCL with LTMs around two core principles of data selection for in-context learning: (1) distribution matching, which balances plasticity and stability, and (2) distribution compression, which controls memory size through diversification and retrieval mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f0f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65e0\u9650\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5b9e\u65f6\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u533a\u5c06\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\uff1a\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u9891\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u6ce8\u957f\u671f\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u957f\u671f\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f0f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u5c06\u65e0\u9650\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5b9e\u65f6\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u6458\u8981\u4f9b\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u5219\uff1a1) \u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\uff08\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\uff0c2) \u5206\u5e03\u538b\u7f29\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u63a7\u5236\u5185\u5b58\u5927\u5c0f\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u4e00\u5728\u6d41\u5f0f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f0f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u538b\u7f29\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u7684\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Bayesian optimization, a widely used black-box and sample-efficient learning method, constructs a probabilistic surrogate of the closed-loop performance from few experiments and uses it to select informative controller parameters. However, it typically struggles with dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations, as they may appear, for example, in tuning model predictive controllers, because standard surrogate models fail to capture the structure of such spaces. This work suggests that the use of Bayesian neural networks as surrogate models may help to mitigate this limitation. Through a comparison between Gaussian processes with Matern kernels, finite-width Bayesian neural networks, and infinite-width Bayesian neural networks on a cart-pole task, we find that Bayesian neural network surrogate models achieve faster and more reliable convergence of the closed-loop cost and enable successful optimization of parameterizations with hundreds of dimensions. Infinite-width Bayesian neural networks also maintain performance in settings with more than one thousand parameters, whereas Matern-kernel Gaussian processes rapidly lose effectiveness.

While robust aggregation methods (including Krum, Bulyan, and coordinate-wise defenses) offer theoretical guarantees under idealized assumptions, their effectiveness erodes substantially when client data distributions are heterogeneous (non-IID) and adversaries can observe or approximate the defense mechanism.\n  This paper introduces SpectralKrum, a defense that fuses spectral subspace estimation with geometric neighbor-based selection. The core insight is that benign optimization trajectories, despite per-client heterogeneity, concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold that can be estimated from historical aggregates. SpectralKrum projects incoming updates into this learned subspace, applies Krum selection in compressed coordinates, and filters candidates whose orthogonal residual energy exceeds a data-driven threshold. The method requires no auxiliary data, operates entirely on model updates, and preserves FL privacy properties.\n  We evaluate SpectralKrum against eight robust baselines across seven attack scenarios on CIFAR-10 with Dirichlet-distributed non-IID partitions (alpha = 0.1). Experiments spanning over 56,000 training rounds show that SpectralKrum is competitive against directional and subspace-aware attacks (adaptive-steer, buffer-drift), but offers limited advantage under label-flip and min-max attacks where malicious updates remain spectrally indistinguishable from benign ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpectralKrum\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u8c31\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u90bb\u5c45\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u805a\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u826f\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u5750\u6807\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528Krum\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6b63\u4ea4\u6b8b\u5dee\u80fd\u91cf\u8d85\u6807\u7684\u5019\u9009\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6ce8\u5165\u6076\u610f\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5f02\u6784\u4e14\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u80fd\u89c2\u5bdf\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "SpectralKrum\u7ed3\u5408\u8c31\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u90bb\u5c45\u9009\u62e9\uff1a1\uff09\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u805a\u5408\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u826f\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u4f20\u5165\u66f4\u65b0\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u8be5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u5750\u6807\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528Krum\u9009\u62e9\uff1b4\uff09\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6b63\u4ea4\u6b8b\u5dee\u80fd\u91cf\u8d85\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u9608\u503c\u7684\u5019\u9009\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cSpectralKrum\u5bf9\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u548c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\uff08adaptive-steer, buffer-drift\uff09\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u5927\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u4f18\u52bf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6076\u610f\u66f4\u65b0\u5728\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u4e0e\u826f\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "SpectralKrum\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u548c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

We propose the Adaptive Vekua Cascade (AVC), a hybrid architecture that bridges deep learning and classical approximation theory. AVC decouples manifold learning from function approximation by using a deep network to learn a diffeomorphic warping of the physical domain, projecting complex spatiotemporal dynamics onto a latent manifold where the solution is represented by a basis of generalized analytic functions. Crucially, we replace the standard gradient-descent output layer with a differentiable linear solver, allowing the network to optimally resolve spectral coefficients in a closed form during the forward pass. We evaluate AVC on a suite of five rigorous physics benchmarks, including high-frequency Helmholtz wave propagation, sparse medical reconstruction, and unsteady 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence. Our results demonstrate that AVC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing parameter counts by orders of magnitude (e.g., 840 parameters vs. 4.2 million for 3D grids) and converging 2-3x faster than implicit neural representations.

We develop a unified, measure-based framework for studying single-layer softmax attention under both finite and infinite prompts. For i.i.d.

Building on this insight, we establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the output and gradient of softmax attention, quantifying how rapidly the finite-prompt model approaches its infinite-prompt counterpart, and prove that this concentration remains stable along the entire training trajectory in general in-context learning settings with sub-Gaussian tokens. In the case of in-context linear regression, we use the tractable infinite-prompt dynamics to analyze training at finite prompt length. Our results allow optimization analyses developed for linear attention to transfer directly to softmax attention when prompts are sufficiently long, showing that large-prompt softmax attention inherits the analytical structure of its linear counterpart.

We present a simple geometric method for discovering interactions and redundancies: when elements are added in random sequential orders and their contributions plotted over many trials, characteristic L-shaped patterns emerge that directly reflect interaction structure. The approach quantifies how the contribution of each element depends on those added before it, revealing patterns that distinguish interaction, independence, and redundancy on a unified scale. When pairwise contributions are visualized as two--dimensional point clouds, redundant pairs form L--shaped patterns where only the first-added element contributes, while synergistic pairs form L--shaped patterns where only elements contribute together. Independent elements show order--invariant distributions. We formalize this with the L--score, a continuous measure ranging from $-1$ (perfect synergy, e.g. $Y=X_1X_2$) to $0$ (independence) to $+1$ (perfect redundancy, $X_1 \\approx X_2$). The relative scaling of the L--shaped arms reveals feature dominance in which element consistently provides more information. Although computed only from pairwise measurements, higher--order interactions among three or more elements emerge naturally through consistent cross--pair relationships (e.g. AB, AC, BC).

Traditional recommender systems primarily rely on user behavioral data such as clicks, views, or ratings, while neglecting users' real-time emotional and intentional states during content interaction. To address this limitation, this study proposes a Multi-Modal Emotion and Intent Recognition Model (MMEI) based on a BERT-based Cross-Modal Transformer with Attention-Based Fusion, integrated into a cloud-native personalized AIGC recommendation framework. The proposed system jointly processes visual (facial expression), auditory (speech tone), and textual (comments or utterances) modalities through pretrained encoders ViT, Wav2Vec2, and BERT, followed by an attention-based fusion module to learn emotion-intent representations. These embeddings are then used to drive personalized content recommendations through a contextual matching layer. Experiments conducted on benchmark emotion datasets (AIGC-INT, MELD, and CMU-MOSEI) and an AIGC interaction dataset demonstrate that the proposed MMEI model achieves a 4.3% improvement in F1-score and a 12.3% reduction in cross-entropy loss compared to the best fusion-based transformer baseline. Furthermore, user-level online evaluations reveal that emotion-driven recommendations increase engagement time by 15.2% and enhance satisfaction scores by 11.8%, confirming the model's effectiveness in aligning AI-generated content with users' affective and intentional states. This work highlights the potential of cross-modal emotional intelligence for next-generation AIGC ecosystems, enabling adaptive, empathetic, and context-aware recommendation experiences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u610f\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u7684AIGC\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u542c\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AIGC\u5728\u97f3\u4e50\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u6587\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\uff08\u70b9\u51fb\u3001\u89c2\u770b\u3001\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eBERT\u8de8\u6a21\u6001Transformer\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u610f\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff08MMEI\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ViT\u3001Wav2Vec2\u548cBERT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\uff08\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\uff09\u3001\u542c\u89c9\uff08\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8c03\uff09\u548c\u6587\u672c\uff08\u8bc4\u8bba\u6216\u8bdd\u8bed\uff09\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5b66\u4e60\u60c5\u611f\u610f\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5339\u914d\u5c42\u9a71\u52a8\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u60c5\u611f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08AIGC-INT\u3001MELD\u3001CMU-MOSEI\uff09\u548cAIGC\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cMMEI\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u878d\u5408Transformer\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e864.3%\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8612.3%\u3002\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u9a71\u52a8\u63a8\u8350\u4f7f\u53c2\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\u4e8615.2%\uff0c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8611.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3AIGC\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u5171\u60c5\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5c06AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

The result is a general computational mechanism linking developmental learning in the brain with principled representation learning in artificial systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Symmetry-Loss\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u5927\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u79f0\u7fa4\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u5efa\u7acb\u5927\u8111\u53d1\u80b2\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6865\u6881\u3002\u5927\u8111\u76ae\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u5728\u53d1\u80b2\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u4e0e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd9\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u673a\u5236\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u7fa4\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSymmetry-Loss\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u79f0\u7fa4\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u60ca\u5947\uff08\u5373\u504f\u79bb\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff09\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8111\u7684\u53d1\u80b2\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "conclusion": "Symmetry-Loss\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u7fa4\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u7edf\u4e00\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u5927\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8111\u53d1\u80b2\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We propose a biologically inspired mathematical model that uses this idea to identify and separate the self from the environment and then build and use a self-model for better predictions. This is a model of neocortical columns governed by the basal ganglia to make predictions and choose the next action, where some columns act as 'what' columns and others act as 'where' columns. Based on this model, we present a reinforcement learning agent that learns purposeful behavior in a virtual environment. We evaluate the agent on the Atari games Pong and Breakout, where it successfully learns to play. We conclude that the ability to separate the self from the environment gives advantages to the agent and therefore such a model could appear in living organisms during evolution.

While MLIPs could enable large-scale atomistic simulations with near-quantum accuracy, their usefulness is often limited by poor transferability to out-of-distribution samples. Here, we systematically evaluate different MLIP architectures with long-range corrections across diverse chemical spaces and show that such schemes are essential, not only for improving in-distribution performance but, more importantly, for enabling significant gains in transferability to unseen regions of chemical space. To enable a more rigorous benchmarking, we introduce biased train-test splitting strategies, which explicitly test the model performance in significantly different regions of chemical space. Together, our findings highlight the importance of long-range modeling for achieving generalizable MLIPs and provide a framework for diagnosing systematic failures across chemical space.

The method -- Spatial Transcriptomics via Adaptive Regularization and Kernels (STARK) -- augments kernel ridge regression with an incrementally adaptive graph Laplacian regularizer. In each iteration, we (1) perform kernel ridge regression with a fixed graph to update the image, and (2) update the graph based on the new image. The kernel ridge regression step involves reducing the infinite dimensional problem on a space of images to finite dimensions via a modified representer theorem. Starting with a purely spatial graph, and updating it as we improve our image makes the graph more robust to noise in low sequencing depth regimes. We show that the aforementioned approach optimizes a block-convex objective through an alternating minimization scheme wherein the sub-problems have closed form expressions that are easily computed.

In this work, we build treatment failure models based on the Real World Evidence (RWE) gathered from patients' profiles available in our oncology EMR/EHR system. We also describe our feature engineering pipeline, experimental methods, and valuable insights obtained about treatment failures from trained models.

The core methodology involves leveraging semantic information from image captions during model training to improve generalization capabilities. Two key strategies are presented: Image Text Matching (ITM) guidance and Image Text fusion. ITM guidance trains the model to discern fine grained alignments between images and texts to obtain enhanced multimodal representations. Image text fusion combines both modalities into comprehensive representations for improved fairness. Exensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate these approaches effectively mitigate bias and improve accuracy across gender racial groups compared to existing methods. Additionally, the unique integration of textual guidance underscores an interpretable and intuitive training paradigm for computer vision systems. By scrutinizing the extent to which semantic information reduces disparities, this research offers valuable insights into cultivating more equitable facial analysis algorithms. The proposed methodologies contribute to addressing the pivotal challenge of demographic bias in gender classification from facial images.

In the well-studied offline or batch outlier detection problem, traditional methods such as kernel One-Class SVM (OCSVM) are both computationally heavy and prone to large false-negative (Type II) errors under non-stationarity. To remedy this, we introduce SONAR, an efficient SGD-based OCSVM solver with strongly convex regularization. We show novel theoretical guarantees on the Type I/II errors of SONAR, superior to those known for OCSVM, and further prove that SONAR ensures favorable lifelong learning guarantees under benign distribution shifts. In the more challenging problem of adversarial non-stationary data, we show that SONAR can be used within an ensemble method and equipped with changepoint detection to achieve adaptive guarantees, ensuring small Type I/II errors on each phase of data.

However, it is limited to four languages: Czech, English, French, and German. This restriction has led many researchers to focus their investigations only on these languages. As a result, MMT research on diverse languages has been stalled because the official Multi30k dataset only represents European languages in Latin scripts. Previous efforts to extend Multi30k exist, but the list of supported languages, represented language families, and scripts is still very short. To address these issues, we propose MultiScript30k, a new Multi30k dataset extension for global languages in various scripts, created by translating the English version of Multi30k (Multi30k-En) using NLLB200-3.3B. The dataset consists of over \\(30000\\) sentences and provides translations of all sentences in Multi30k-En into Ar, Es, Uk, Zh\\_Hans and Zh\\_Hant. Similarity analysis shows that Multi30k extension consistently achieves greater than \\(0.8\\) cosine similarity and symmetric KL divergence less than \\(0.000251\\) for all languages supported except Zh\\_Hant which is comparable to the previous Multi30k extensions ArEnMulti30k and Multi30k-Uk. COMETKiwi scores reveal mixed assessments of MultiScript30k as a translation of Multi30k-En in comparison to the related work.

In many domains, such as personalized medicine, local interpretations for individual predictions are often required, rather than global scores summarizing overall feature importance. Random Forests (RFs) are widely used in these settings, and existing interpretability methods typically exploit tree structures and split statistics to provide model-specific insights. However, theoretical understanding of local FII methods for RF remains limited, making it unclear how to interpret high importance scores for individual predictions. We propose a novel, local, model-specific FII method that identifies frequent co-occurrences of features along decision paths, combining global patterns with those observed on paths specific to a given test point. We prove that our method consistently recovers the true local signal features and their interactions under a Locally Spike Sparse (LSS) model and also identifies whether large or small feature values drive a prediction.

TPV is a fully label-free object whose trace form separates the geometry of the trained model from the specific perturbation mechanism, allowing a broad family of parameter perturbations like SGD noise, label noise, finite-precision noise, and other post-training perturbations to be analyzed under a single framework. Theoretically, we show that TPV estimated on the training set converges to its test-set value in the overparameterized limit, providing the first result that prediction variance under local parameter perturbations can be inferred from training inputs alone. Empirically, TPV exhibits a striking stability across datasets and architectures -- including extremely narrow networks -- and correlates well with clean test loss. Finally, we demonstrate that modeling pruning as a TPV perturbation yields a simple label-free importance measure that performs competitively with state-of-the-art pruning methods, illustrating the practical utility of TPV.

In this work, we propose WeldNet: Windowed Encoders for Learning Dynamics, a data-driven nonlinear model reduction framework to build a low-dimensional surrogate model for complex evolution systems. Given time-dependent training data, we split the time domain into multiple overlapping windows, within which nonlinear dimension reduction is performed by auto-encoders to capture latent codes. Once a low-dimensional representation of the data is learned, a propagator network is trained to capture the evolution of the latent codes in each window, and a transcoder is trained to connect the latent codes between adjacent windows. The proposed windowed decomposition significantly simplifies propagator training by breaking long-horizon dynamics into multiple short, manageable segments, while the transcoders ensure consistency across windows. In addition to the algorithmic framework, we develop a mathematical theory establishing the representation power of WeldNet under the manifold hypothesis, justifying the success of nonlinear model reduction via deep autoencoder-based architectures. Our numerical experiments on various differential equations indicate that WeldNet can capture nonlinear latent structures and their underlying dynamics, outperforming both traditional projection-based approaches and recently developed nonlinear model reduction methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "WeldNet\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a97\u53e3\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u9636\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7a97\u53e3\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u6742\u6f14\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u95ee\u9898\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u62df\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4f4e\u7ef4\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b", "method": "\u5c06\u65f6\u57df\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u91cd\u53e0\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u964d\u7ef4\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u6f5c\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f20\u64ad\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u6f5c\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6c\u7801\u5668\u8fde\u63a5\u76f8\u90bb\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7f16\u7801", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eWeldNet\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u83b7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u5e95\u5c42\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8fd1\u671f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "WeldNet\u901a\u8fc7\u7a97\u53e3\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u5c06\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u77ed\u800c\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u4f20\u64ad\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8f6c\u7801\u5668\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u7a97\u53e3\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6f14\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u9636\u6846\u67b6"}}

The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance.

With the emergence of 3D generation, this task has undergone a transformative impact, shifting not only from visual fidelity to functional utility but also enabling editable CAD designs. Prior works have achieved early success in single-part CAD generation, which is not well-suited for real-world applications, as multiple parts need to be assembled under semantic and geometric constraints. In this paper, we propose CADKnitter, a compositional CAD generation framework with a geometry-guided diffusion sampling strategy. CADKnitter is able to generate a complementary CAD part that follows both the geometric constraints of the given CAD model and the semantic constraints of the desired design text prompt. We also curate a dataset, so-called KnitCAD, containing over 310,000 samples of CAD models, along with textual prompts and assembly metadata that provide semantic and geometric constraints.

Robust and scalable bibliographies ensure that we can measure the scientific impact of our facilities and archives. However, the growing rate of publications threatens to outpace our ability to manually label astronomical literature. We therefore present the Automated Mission Classifier (amc), a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to identify and categorize telescope references by processing large quantities of paper text. A modified version of amc performs well on the TRACS Kaggle challenge, achieving a macro $F_1$ score of 0.84 on the held-out test set. amc is valuable for other telescopes beyond TRACS; we developed the initial software for identifying papers that featured scientific results by NASA missions. Additionally, we investigate how amc can also be used to interrogate historical datasets and surface potential label errors. Our work demonstrates that LLM-based applications offer powerful and scalable assistance for library sciences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u6587\u732e\u5206\u7c7b\u5de5\u5177AMC\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u76f8\u5173\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u5728TRACS\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u6587\u732e\u5df2\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5f71\u54cd\u529b", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u8bba\u6587\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\u5668AMC\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u5f15\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6539\u8fdb\u7248\u672c\u7528\u4e8eTRACS\u6311\u6218", "result": "AMC\u5728TRACS Kaggle\u6311\u6218\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f970.84\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522bNASA\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u6210\u679c\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u9519\u8bef", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e3a\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u79d1\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5929\u6587\u6587\u732e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1"}}

Many recent methods represent the world through images, and reduce forecasting to stochastic video generation. Although such methods excel at realism and visual fidelity, predicting pixels is computationally intensive and not directly useful in many applications, as it requires translating RGB into signals useful for decision making. An alternative approach uses features from vision foundation models (VFMs) as world representations, performing deterministic regression to predict future world states. These features can be directly translated into actionable signals such as semantic segmentation and depth, while remaining computationally efficient. However, deterministic regression averages over multiple plausible futures, undermining forecast accuracy by failing to capture uncertainty. To address this crucial limitation, we introduce a generative forecaster that performs autoregressive flow matching in VFM feature space. Our key insight is that generative modeling in this space requires encoding VFM features into a compact latent space suitable for diffusion. We show that this latent space preserves information more effectively than previously used PCA-based alternatives, both for forecasting and other applications, such as image generation. Our latent predictions can be easily decoded into multiple useful and interpretable output modalities: semantic segmentation, depth, surface normals, and even RGB. With matched architecture and compute, our method produces sharper and more accurate predictions than regression across all modalities. Our results suggest that stochastic conditional generation of VFM features offers a promising and scalable foundation for future world models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6bd4\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6781\u7aef\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eVFM\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001", "method": "\u5728VFM\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u5c06VFM\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u9002\u5408\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8be5\u7a7a\u95f4\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684PCA\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u4fe1\u606f", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u8868\u9762\u6cd5\u7ebf\u3001RGB\uff09\u4e0a\u90fd\u6bd4\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d", "conclusion": "VFM\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8f93\u51fa"}}

Existing approaches excel at optimizing efficiency and enforcing safety constraints but lack mechanisms to ensure equitable service, resulting in systematic starvation of vehicles on low-demand approaches. We propose a hierarchical framework combining multi-objective reinforcement learning for local intersection control with strategic routing for network-level coordination. Our approach introduces a Conflict Threat Vector that provides agents with explicit risk signals for proactive conflict avoidance, and a queue parity penalty that ensures equitable service across all traffic streams. Extensive experiments on a real-world network across different robot vehicle (RV) penetration rates demonstrate substantial improvements: up to 53% reductions in average wait time, up to 86% reductions in maximum starvation, and up to 86\\% reduction in conflict rate compared to baselines, while maintaining fuel efficiency. Our analysis reveals that strategic routing effectiveness scales with RV penetration, becoming increasingly valuable at higher autonomy levels.

Classical methods usually follow a two-stage framework: machine learning algorithms are employed to produce forecasts that closely fit the realized returns, and the predicted values are then used in a downstream portfolio optimization problem to determine the asset weights. This separation leads to a fundamental misalignment between predictions and decision outcomes, while also ignoring the impact of transaction costs. To bridge this gap, recent studies have proposed the idea of end-to-end learning, integrating the two stages into a single pipeline. This paper introduces IPMO (Integrated Prediction and Multi-period Portfolio Optimization), a model for multi-period mean-variance portfolio optimization with turnover penalties. The predictor generates multi-period return forecasts that parameterize a differentiable convex optimization layer, which in turn drives learning via portfolio performance. For scalability, we introduce a mirror-descent fixed-point (MDFP) differentiation scheme that avoids factorizing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) systems, which thus yields stable implicit gradients and nearly scale-insensitive runtime as the decision horizon grows. In experiments with real market data and two representative time-series prediction models, the IPMO method consistently outperforms the two-stage benchmarks in risk-adjusted performance net of transaction costs and achieves more coherent allocation paths. Our results show that integrating machine learning prediction with optimization in the multi-period setting improves financial outcomes and remains computationally tractable.", "AI": {"tldr": "IPMO\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u591a\u671f\u6536\u76ca\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8003\u8651\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u671f\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIPMO\uff08\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u591a\u671f\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u751f\u6210\u591a\u671f\u6536\u76ca\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u53ef\u5fae\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u8868\u73b0\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u955c\u50cf\u4e0b\u964d\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\uff08MDFP\uff09\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5206\u89e3KKT\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u63a5\u8fd1\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cIPMO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6263\u9664\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c\u540e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u914d\u7f6e\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u591a\u671f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u591f\u6539\u5584\u8d22\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, SFT can have difficulty generalizing when the underlying data distribution changes, even when the new data does not fall completely outside the training domain. Recent reasoning-focused models such as o1 and R1 have demonstrated consistent gains over their non-reasoning counterparts, highlighting the importance of reasoning for improved generalization and reliability. However, collecting high-quality reasoning traces for SFT remains challenging -- annotations are costly, subjective, and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable models to learn reasoning strategies directly from task outcomes. We propose a pipeline in which LLMs generate reasoning steps that guide both the invocation of tools (e.g., function calls) and the final answer generation for conversational agents. Our method employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with rewards designed around tool accuracy and answer correctness, allowing the model to iteratively refine its reasoning and actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves both the quality of reasoning and the precision of tool invocations, achieving a 1.5% relative improvement over the SFT model (trained without explicit thinking) and a 40% gain compared to the base of the vanilla Qwen3-1.7B model. These findings demonstrate the promise of unifying reasoning and action learning through RL to build more capable and generalizable conversational agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4SFT\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f971.5%\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347", "motivation": "\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982o1\u548cR1\uff09\u663e\u793a\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff1aLLM\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u6307\u5bfc\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56f4\u7ed5\u5de5\u5177\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u52a8", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1a\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u7684SFT\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f971.5%\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840Qwen3-1.7B\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f9740%\u589e\u76ca", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u4e00\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86RL\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b"}}

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides reliable maritime surveillance under all weather and lighting conditions, but classifying small maritime objects in SAR imagery remains challenging. We investigate quantum machine learning for this task, focusing on Quantum Kernel Methods (QKMs) applied to real and complex SAR chips extracted from the SARFish dataset. We tackle two binary classification problems, the first for distinguishing vessels from non-vessels, and the second for distinguishing fishing vessels from other types of vessels. We compare QKMs applied to real and complex SAR chips against classical Laplacian, RBF, and linear kernels applied to real SAR chips. Using noiseless numerical simulations of the quantum kernels, we find that QKMs are capable of obtaining equal or better performance than the classical kernel on these tasks in the best case, but do not demonstrate a clear advantage for the complex SAR data.

However, the black-box nature of state-of-the-art models remains a significant barrier to adoption, as high-stakes safety decisions demand verifiable structural insights alongside predictive performance. To address this, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework designed to jointly enhance accuracy and interpretability. Our architecture integrates a shared chemical language model with task-specific attention modules. By imposing an L1 sparsity penalty on these modules, the framework is constrained to focus on a minimal set of salient molecular fragments for each distinct toxicity endpoint. The resulting framework is trained end-to-end and is readily adaptable to various transformer-based backbones. Evaluated on the ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21 benchmark datasets, our approach consistently outperforms both single-task and standard MTL baselines. Crucially, the sparse attention weights provide chemically intuitive visualizations that reveal the specific fragments influencing predictions, thereby enhancing insight into the model's decision-making process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5b50\u6bd2\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u6bd2\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u597d\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u51b3\u7b56\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53c8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5316\u5b66\u76f4\u89c9\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u65bd\u52a0L1\u7a00\u758f\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6bd2\u6027\u7ec8\u70b9\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5173\u952e\u5206\u5b50\u7247\u6bb5\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728ClinTox\u3001SIDER\u548cTox21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u5b50\u7247\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We introduce a model in which visible and hidden variables interact through two independently parametrized transition matrices, defining a Markov chain whose steady state is intrinsically out of equilibrium. Likelihood maximization drives this system toward nonequilibrium steady states with finite entropy production, reduced self-transition probabilities, and persistent probability currents in the latent space. These cycles are not imposed by the architecture but arise from training, and models that develop them avoid the low-log-likelihood regime associated with nearly reversible dynamics while more faithfully reproducing the empirical distribution of data classes. Compared with equilibrium approaches such as restricted Boltzmann machines, our model breaks the detailed balance between the forward and backward conditional transitions and relies on a log-likelihood gradient that depends explicitly on the last two steps of the Markov chain. Hence, this exploration of the interface between nonequilibrium statistical physics and modern machine learning suggests that introducing irreversibility into latent-variable models can enhance generative performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6253\u7834\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u81f4\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6982\u7387\u6d41\u7684\u81ea\u53d1\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u53d7\u9650\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u673a\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89c1\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u6001\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u5904\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u3002\u4f3c\u7136\u6700\u5927\u5316\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8b\u5411\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u71b5\u4ea7\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u81ea\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\u548c\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u6982\u7387\u6d41\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7a33\u6001\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u524d\u5411\u548c\u540e\u5411\u6761\u4ef6\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ec6\u81f4\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u660e\u786e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u6700\u540e\u4e24\u6b65\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u81ea\u53d1\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u72b6\u6001\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u662f\u7531\u67b6\u6784\u5f3a\u52a0\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4e4e\u53ef\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5730\u518d\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u4e0e\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u5f15\u5165\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In visual generation, however, these powerful core models are typically reduced to global text encoders for diffusion models, leaving most of their reasoning and planning ability unused. This creates a gap: current multimodal LLMs can parse complex layouts, attributes, and knowledge-intensive scenes, yet struggle to generate images or videos with equally precise and structured control. We propose MetaCanvas, a lightweight framework that lets MLLMs reason and plan directly in spatial and spatiotemporal latent spaces and interface tightly with diffusion generators. We empirically implement MetaCanvas on three different diffusion backbones and evaluate it across six tasks, including text-to-image generation, text/image-to-video generation, image/video editing, and in-context video generation, each requiring precise layouts, robust attribute binding, and reasoning-intensive control. MetaCanvas consistently outperforms global-conditioning baselines, suggesting that treating MLLMs as latent-space planners is a promising direction for narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "MetaCanvas\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7d27\u5bc6\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf/\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u6790\u590d\u6742\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u964d\u7ea7\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMetaCanvas\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9MLLMs\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7d27\u5bc6\u63a5\u53e3\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "MetaCanvas\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6587\u672c/\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3001\u56fe\u50cf/\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff09\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u7ed1\u5b9a\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06MLLMs\u89c6\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u662f\u7f29\u5c0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u5411\uff0cMetaCanvas\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u5411\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, SSL for 3D point clouds still faces critical challenges due to irregular geometry, shortcut-prone reconstruction, and unbalanced semantics distribution. In this work, we propose DOS (Distilling Observable Softmaps), a novel SSL framework that self-distills semantic relevance softmaps only at observable (unmasked) points. This strategy prevents information leakage from masked regions and provides richer supervision than discrete token-to-prototype assignments. To address the challenge of unbalanced semantics in an unsupervised setting, we introduce Zipfian prototypes and incorporate them using a modified Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, Zipf-Sinkhorn, which enforces a power-law prior over prototype usage and modulates the sharpness of the target softmap during training. DOS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on semantic segmentation and 3D object detection across multiple benchmarks, including nuScenes, Waymo, SemanticKITTI, ScanNet, and ScanNet200, without relying on extra data or annotations.

Deep learning is particularly effective for this task, as it integrates spectral, temporal, and spatial signals that jointly reflect the canopy structure. To address this need, we introduce THREASURE-Net, a novel end-to-end framework for Tree Height Regression And Super-Resolution. The model is trained on Sentinel-2 time series using reference height metrics derived from LiDAR HD data at multiple spatial resolutions over Metropolitan France to produce annual height maps. We evaluate three model variants, producing tree-height predictions at 2.5 m, 5 m, and 10 m resolution. THREASURE-Net does not rely on any pretrained model nor on reference very high resolution optical imagery to train its super-resolution module; instead, it learns solely from LiDAR-derived height information. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods based on Sentinel data and is competitive with methods based on very high resolution imagery. It can be deployed to generate high-precision annual canopy-height maps, achieving mean absolute errors of 2.62 m, 2.72 m, and 2.88 m at 2.5 m, 5 m, and 10 m resolution, respectively. These results highlight the potential of THREASURE-Net for scalable and cost-effective structural monitoring of temperate forests using only freely available satellite data.

Existing approaches for LLM auditing often focus on isolated aspects of model behavior, such as detecting specific biases or evaluating fairness. We are interested in a more general question -- can we understand how the outputs of black-box LLMs depend on each input token? There is a critical need to have such tools in real-world applications that rely on inaccessible API endpoints to language models. However, this is a highly non-trivial problem, as LLMs are stochastic functions (i.e. two outputs will be different by chance), while computing prompt-level gradients to approximate input sensitivity is infeasible. To address this, we propose Distribution-Based Sensitivity Analysis (DBSA), a lightweight model-agnostic procedure to evaluate the sensitivity of the output of a language model for each input token, without making any distributional assumptions about the LLM. DBSA is developed as a practical tool for practitioners, enabling quick, plug-and-play visual exploration of LLMs reliance on specific input tokens. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate how DBSA can enable users to inspect LLM inputs and find sensitivities that may be overlooked by existing LLM interpretability methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDBSA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5ba1\u8ba1\u9ed1\u76d2\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165token\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72LLM\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u9762\uff08\u5982\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165token\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u7531\u4e8eLLM\u662f\u9ed1\u76d2API\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDistribution-Based Sensitivity Analysis (DBSA)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9LLM\u505a\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8f93\u5165token\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "DBSA\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u68c0\u67e5LLM\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DBSA\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u63d2\u4ef6\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u5206\u6790\u9ed1\u76d2LLM\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165token\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional methods face challenges, such as noisy data, and manual parameter tuning, among others. Recently deep learning approaches have proposed alternative solutions to some of these problems. However, important challenges of existing deep learning approaches are spatially inconsistent results across neighboring seismic gathers and lack of user-control. We address these limitations by introducing ContextSeisNet, an in-context learning model, to seismic demultiple processing. Our approach conditions predictions on a support set of spatially related example pairs: neighboring common-depth point gathers from the same seismic line and their corresponding labels. This allows the model to learn task-specific processing behavior at inference time by observing how similar gathers should be processed, without any retraining. This method provides both flexibility through user-defined examples and improved lateral consistency across seismic lines. On synthetic data, ContextSeisNet outperforms a U-Net baseline quantitatively and demonstrates enhanced spatial coherence between neighboring gathers. On field data, our model achieves superior lateral consistency compared to both traditional Radon demultiple and the U-Net baseline.

Existing approaches vary in their flexibility, interpretability, scalability, and support for diverse outcome types, often limiting their utility in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose a neural network-based partial-linear single-index (NeuralPLSI) modeling framework that bridges semiparametric regression modeling interpretability with the expressive power of deep learning. The NeuralPLSI model constructs an interpretable exposure index via a learnable projection and models its relationship with the outcome through a flexible neural network. The framework accommodates continuous, binary, and time-to-event outcomes, and supports inference through a bootstrap-based procedure that yields confidence intervals for key model parameters. We evaluated NeuralPLSI through simulation studies under a range of scenarios and applied it to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to demonstrate its practical utility. Together, our contributions establish NeuralPLSI as a scalable, interpretable, and versatile modeling tool for mixture analysis.

As a result, LLMs answer without support, hallucinate under incomplete or misleading context, and rely on spurious evidence. We introduce a training framework that treats the entire RAG pipeline -- both the retriever and the generator -- as an interactive proof system via an adaptation of the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) protocol. Arthur (the generator LLM) trains on questions of unkown provenance: Merlin provides helpful evidence, while Morgana injects adversarial, misleading context. Both use a linear-time XAI method to identify and modify the evidence most influential to Arthur. Consequently, Arthur learns to (i) answer when the context support the answer, (ii) reject when evidence is insufficient, and (iii) rely on the specific context spans that truly ground the answer. We further introduce a rigorous evaluation framework to disentangle explanation fidelity from baseline predictive errors. This allows us to introduce and measure the Explained Information Fraction (EIF), which normalizes M/A certified mutual-information guarantees relative to model capacity and imperfect benchmarks. Across three RAG datasets and two model families of varying sizes, M/A-trained LLMs show improved groundedness, completeness, soundness, and reject behavior, as well as reduced hallucinations -- without needing manually annotated unanswerable questions. The retriever likewise improves recall and MRR through automatically generated M/A hard positives and negatives.

Tasks such as drug recommendation, treatment planning, and adverse-effect prediction demand robust, multi-step reasoning grounded in reliable biomedical knowledge. Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals.

However, this task faces a fundamental challenge when the governing equations are unknown and observational data are sparse. System stiffness, the coupling of multiple time-scales, further exacerbates this problem and hinders long-term prediction. Existing methods fall short: purely data-driven methods demand massive datasets, whereas physics-aware approaches are constrained by their reliance on known equations and fine-grained time steps. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an equation-free learning framework, namely, the Stable Spectral Neural Operator (SSNO), for modeling stiff partial differential equation (PDE) systems based on limited data. Instead of encoding specific equation terms, SSNO embeds spectrally inspired structures in its architecture, yielding strong inductive biases for learning the underlying physics. It automatically learns local and global spatial interactions in the frequency domain, while handling system stiffness with a robust integrating factor time-stepping scheme. Demonstrated across multiple 2D and 3D benchmarks in Cartesian and spherical geometries, SSNO achieves prediction errors one to two orders of magnitude lower than leading models. Crucially, it shows remarkable data efficiency, requiring only very few (2--5) training trajectories for robust generalization to out-of-distribution conditions.

Traditional formal verification tools fall short when faced with systems that embed both opaque, black-box AI components and complex stochastic dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce LUCID (Learning-enabled Uncertainty-aware Certification of stochastIc Dynamical systems), a verification engine for certifying safety of black-box stochastic dynamical systems from a finite dataset of random state transitions. As such, LUCID is the first known tool capable of establishing quantified safety guarantees for such systems. Thanks to its modular architecture and extensive documentation, LUCID is designed for easy extensibility. LUCID employs a data-driven methodology rooted in control barrier certificates, which are learned directly from system transition data, to ensure formal safety guarantees. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), where an RKHS ambiguity set is constructed that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. A key innovation within LUCID is its use of a finite Fourier kernel expansion to reformulate a semi-infinite non-convex optimization problem into a tractable linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. LUCID thus offers a robust and efficient verification framework, able to handle the complexities of modern black-box systems while providing formal guarantees of safety.

Although conformal methods can give guarantees on marginal coverage, no method can guarantee to produce sets with correct conditional coverage, leaving practitioners without a clear way to interpret local deviations. To overcome sample-inefficiency and overfitting issues of existing metrics, we cast conditional coverage estimation as a classification problem. Conditional coverage is violated if and only if any classifier can achieve lower risk than the target coverage. Through the choice of a (proper) loss function, the resulting risk difference gives a conservative estimate of natural miscoverage measures such as L1 and L2 distance, and can even separate the effects of over- and under-coverage, and non-constant target coverages. We call the resulting family of metrics excess risk of the target coverage (ERT). We show experimentally that the use of modern classifiers provides much higher statistical power than simple classifiers underlying established metrics like CovGap. Additionally, we use our metric to benchmark different conformal prediction methods. Finally, we release an open-source package for ERT as well as previous conditional coverage metrics. Together, these contributions provide a new lens for understanding, diagnosing, and improving the conditional reliability of predictive systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faERT\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u8bc4\u4f30\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u8fc7\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u6b20\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\u662f\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u6700\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u6311\u6218\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89e3\u91ca\u5c40\u90e8\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\u5f53\u4e14\u4ec5\u5f53\u4efb\u4f55\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4f4e\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5dee\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bef\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u98ce\u9669(ERT)\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807(\u5982CovGap)\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86ERT\u53ca\u5148\u524d\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u5305\u3002", "conclusion": "ERT\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}
