### [1] [Efficient Training-Free Online Routing for High-Volume Multi-LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02718)
*Fangzhou Wu,Sandeep Silwal*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无需训练的在线LLM路由算法，通过近似最近邻搜索和一次性优化，在高查询量和令牌预算约束下实现了竞争性能比的路由效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型服务需求的增长，部署和计算成本大幅上升。现有路由方案主要面向离线场景，无法满足在线高查询量和令牌预算约束的需求。

Method: 算法利用近似最近邻搜索来高效估计查询特征，并在小量初始查询集上进行一次性优化学习路由策略，以指导未来的路由。

Result: 算法在3个标准数据集和8个基线方法上进行了广泛实验，平均性能提升3.55倍，成本效率提升1.85倍，吞吐量提升近4.25倍。理论上证明在自然假设下达到竞争比为1-o(1)。

Conclusion: 该方法为大语言模型在线路由提供了一种高效、成本效益明显的解决方案，能够在高并发场景下保持竞争性能。

Abstract: Increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) services imposes
substantial deployment and computation costs on providers. LLM routing offers a
cost-efficient solution by directing queries to the optimal LLM based on model
and query features. However, existing works primarily focus on offline
scenarios and struggle to adapt to online settings with high query volume and
constrained token budgets. In this work, we introduce the first training-free
algorithm for online routing scenarios. Our algorithm leverages approximate
nearest neighbor search to efficiently estimate query features and performs a
one-time optimization over a small set of initial queries to learn a routing
strategy that guides future routing. We provide theoretical guarantees
demonstrating that our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $1 - o(1)$
under natural assumptions, which is further validated by extensive experiments
across 3 benchmark datasets and 8 baselines, showing an average improvement of
3.55$\times$ in overall performance, 1.85$\times$ in cost efficiency, and
nearly 4.25$\times$ in throughput.

### [2] [Cut Costs, Not Accuracy: LLM-Powered Data Processing with Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02896)
*Sepanta Zeighami,Shreya Shankar,Aditya Parameswaran*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: BARGAIN是一种新颖的模型级联方法，通过自适应采样和统计估计策略，在保证输出质量的同时显著降低LLM数据处理成本，平均比现有技术节省86%的成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型处理大规模文本数据时，顶级模型精度高但成本昂贵，廉价模型成本低但质量不稳定。现有模型级联方法成本节省有限且理论保证薄弱。

Method: 采用自适应采样策略和统计估计程序，利用数据和任务特征，基于最新统计工具进行准确估计并提供严格理论保证，支持对准确性、精确度或召回率的保证。

Result: 在8个真实数据集上的实验表明，BARGAIN平均比最先进方法节省86%的成本，同时提供更强的输出准确性理论保证，在保证精确度或召回率方面也有类似收益。

Conclusion: BARGAIN通过创新的统计方法有效解决了LLM数据处理中的成本-质量权衡问题，为大规模文本处理提供了经济高效且理论可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as a building block
in data systems to process large text datasets. To do so, LLM model providers
offer multiple LLMs with different sizes, spanning various cost-quality
trade-offs when processing text at scale. Top-of-the-line LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o,
Claude Sonnet) operate with high accuracy but are prohibitively expensive when
processing many records. To avoid high costs, more affordable but lower quality
LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku) can be used to process records, but we
need to ensure that the overall accuracy does not deviate substantially from
that of the top-of-the-line LLMs. The model cascade framework provides a
blueprint to manage this trade-off, by using the confidence of LLMs in their
output (e.g., log-probabilities) to decide on which records to use the
affordable LLM. However, existing solutions following this framework provide
only marginal cost savings and weak theoretical guarantees because of poor
estimation of the quality of the affordable LLM's outputs. We present BARGAIN,
a method that judiciously uses affordable LLMs in data processing to
significantly reduce cost while providing strong theoretical guarantees on the
solution quality. BARGAIN employs a novel adaptive sampling strategy and
statistical estimation procedure that uses data and task characteristics and
builds on recent statistical tools to make accurate estimations with tight
theoretical guarantees. Variants of BARGAIN can support guarantees on accuracy,
precision, or recall of the output. Experimental results across 8 real-world
datasets show that BARGAIN reduces cost, on average, by up to 86% more than
state-of-the-art, while providing stronger theoretical guarantees on accuracy
of output, with similar gains when guaranteeing a desired level of precision or
recall.

### [3] [CARPO: Leveraging Listwise Learning-to-Rank for Context-Aware Query Plan Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03102)
*Wenrui Zhou,Qiyu Liu,Jingshu Peng,Aoqian Zhang,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: CARPO是一个基于列表学习排序的查询优化框架，通过Transformer模型评估候选执行计划，结合OOD检测和top-k回退策略，显著提升查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于成本的查询优化器由于启发式规则不完善和成本模型不准确，经常生成次优执行计划。现有学习型查询优化器存在成对排序方法的不一致性和次优性问题。

Method: 提出CARPO框架，采用基于Transformer的模型对候选计划集进行整体评估，集成混合决策机制（包含OOD检测和top-k回退策略），可与现有计划嵌入技术无缝集成。

Result: 在TPC-H和STATS基准测试中，CARPO显著优于原生PostgreSQL和Lero，TPC-H基准上的Top-1率达到74.54%（Lero仅为3.63%），总执行时间降至3719.16ms（PostgreSQL为22577.87ms）。

Conclusion: CARPO通过列表学习排序方法和鲁棒的混合决策机制，有效解决了现有学习型查询优化器的局限性，在查询优化性能方面取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Efficient data processing is increasingly vital, with query optimizers
playing a fundamental role in translating SQL queries into optimal execution
plans. Traditional cost-based optimizers, however, often generate suboptimal
plans due to flawed heuristics and inaccurate cost models, leading to the
emergence of Learned Query Optimizers (LQOs). To address challenges in existing
LQOs, such as the inconsistency and suboptimality inherent in pairwise ranking
methods, we introduce CARPO, a generic framework leveraging listwise
learning-to-rank for context-aware query plan optimization. CARPO distinctively
employs a Transformer-based model for holistic evaluation of candidate plan
sets and integrates a robust hybrid decision mechanism, featuring
Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection with a top-$k$ fallback strategy to ensure
reliability. Furthermore, CARPO can be seamlessly integrated with existing plan
embedding techniques, demonstrating strong adaptability. Comprehensive
experiments on TPC-H and STATS benchmarks demonstrate that CARPO significantly
outperforms both native PostgreSQL and Lero, achieving a Top-1 Rate of
\textbf{74.54\%} on the TPC-H benchmark compared to Lero's 3.63\%, and reducing
the total execution time to 3719.16 ms compared to PostgreSQL's 22577.87 ms.

### [4] [Adaptive KV-Cache Compression without Manually Setting Budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03136)
*Chenxia Tang,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Liusheng Huang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: GVote是一种自适应的KV缓存压缩方案，通过蒙特卡洛采样预测未来查询需求，自动确定最优缓存预算，无需人工指定压缩比例，在保持精度的同时实现2倍内存减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前KV缓存压缩方法存在Procrustes' bed问题：强制不同工作负载使用固定压缩比例，导致资源分配和推理性能不佳。内存占用随序列长度快速增长成为效率瓶颈。

Method: 基于重要键值是未来查询所需键值聚合的原则，通过蒙特卡洛风格采样潜在查询并聚合选定键值，自动预测未来查询注意力需求，确定最优缓存预算。

Result: 在GSM8K、RULER和Longbench等多个基准测试中，GVote相比基线方法在保持相当或更高精度的同时，实现了2倍的内存减少。

Conclusion: GVote通过自适应压缩方案解决了固定压缩比例的问题，在精度和效率之间取得了优越的权衡，为大语言模型推理提供了更高效的KV缓存管理方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inference relies heavily on KV-caches to
accelerate autoregressive decoding, but the resulting memory footprint grows
rapidly with sequence length, posing significant efficiency challenges. Current
KV-cache compression methods suffer from a Procrustes' bed problem: they force
diverse workloads into fixed compression ratios, leading to suboptimal resource
allocation and inference performance. To this end, we present GVote, an
adaptive KV-cache compression scheme that eliminates manual budget
specification while achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. GVote
operates on the principle that the important keys are the aggregation of keys
required by future queries. The method predicts future query attention demands
by Monte-Carlo style sampling potential queries and aggregating selected keys
to determine the optimal cache budget without manual specification.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates GVote's effectiveness across multiple
benchmarks, including GSM8K, RULER and Longbench. Compared to baselines, GVote
exhibits 2$\times$ memory reduction while the accuracy maintains higher or
comparable.

### [5] [BAMG: A Block-Aware Monotonic Graph Index for Disk-Based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03226)
*Huiling Li,Jianliang Xu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出BMRNG和BAMG两种新型图索引结构，通过联合考虑几何距离和存储布局来优化磁盘I/O性能，在保持召回率的同时显著提升吞吐量和减少I/O读取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于磁盘的近似最近邻搜索图索引方法要么只优化存储布局，要么独立构建图结构，忽略了二者之间的交互作用，导致磁盘I/O成为性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出BMRNG图结构理论保证I/O单调搜索路径，开发BAMG实用变体（线性时间构建），集成块感知边剪枝、解耦存储设计、多层导航图和块优先搜索算法。

Result: 在真实数据集上实验表明，BAMG相比最先进方法吞吐量提升2.1倍，I/O读取减少52%，同时保持相当的召回率。

Conclusion: 联合考虑几何距离和存储布局的图索引设计能有效解决磁盘ANNS的性能瓶颈问题，BAMG方法在效率和效果上都表现出色。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) over high-dimensional vectors is a
foundational problem in databases, where disk I/O often emerges as the dominant
performance bottleneck at scale. Existing graph indexing solutions for
disk-based ANNS typically either optimize the storage layout for a given graph
or construct the graph independently of the storage layout, thus overlooking
their interaction. In this paper, we propose the Block-aware Monotonic Relative
Neighborhood Graph (BMRNG), a novel graph structure that jointly considers both
geometric distance and storage layout for edge selection, theoretically
guaranteeing the existence of I/O monotonic search paths. To address the
scalability challenge of BMRNG construction, we further develop a practical and
efficient variant, the Block-Aware Monotonic Graph (BAMG), which can be
constructed in linear time from a monotonic graph considering the storage
layout. BAMG integrates block-aware edge pruning with a decoupled storage
design that separates raw vectors from the graph index, thereby maximizing
block utilization and minimizing redundant disk reads. Additionally, we design
a multi-layer navigation graph for adaptive and efficient query entry, along
with a block-first search algorithm that prioritizes intra-block traversal to
fully exploit each disk I/O operation. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that BAMG achieves up to 2.1x higher throughput and
reduces I/O reads by up to 52% compared to state-of-the-art methods, while
maintaining comparable recall.

### [6] [NeurStore: Efficient In-database Deep Learning Model Management System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03228)
*Siqi Xiang,Sheng Wang,Xiaokui Xiao,Cong Yue,Zhanhao Zhao,Beng Chin Ooi*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: NeurStore是一个创新的数据库内模型管理系统，通过张量级存储、增量量化和压缩感知加载机制，实现了高效的深度学习模型存储和利用，在压缩比和模型加载性能方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据库内AI分析应用的普及，需要高效管理日益增长的大规模深度学习模型。现有数据库系统通常将模型作为整体文件存储或使用忽略模型结构特征的压缩技术，导致存储开销不理想。

Method: 1) 使用基于张量的模型存储引擎实现细粒度存储；2) 增强HNSW图索引张量，仅存储相似度阈值内的增量张量实现去重；3) 提出增量量化算法压缩增量张量；4) 设计压缩感知模型加载机制支持直接计算压缩张量。

Result: 实验评估表明，NeurStore相比最先进方法实现了更优的压缩比和具有竞争力的模型加载吞吐量。

Conclusion: NeurStore通过创新的张量级存储和压缩技术，为数据库内深度学习模型管理提供了高效的解决方案，在保持模型精度的同时显著降低了存储开销。

Abstract: With the prevalence of in-database AI-powered analytics, there is an
increasing demand for database systems to efficiently manage the ever-expanding
number and size of deep learning models. However, existing database systems
typically store entire models as monolithic files or apply compression
techniques that overlook the structural characteristics of deep learning
models, resulting in suboptimal model storage overhead. This paper presents
NeurStore, a novel in-database model management system that enables efficient
storage and utilization of deep learning models. First, NeurStore employs a
tensor-based model storage engine to enable fine-grained model storage within
databases. In particular, we enhance the hierarchical navigable small world
(HNSW) graph to index tensors, and only store additional deltas for tensors
within a predefined similarity threshold to ensure tensor-level deduplication.
Second, we propose a delta quantization algorithm that effectively compresses
delta tensors, thus achieving a superior compression ratio with controllable
model accuracy loss. Finally, we devise a compression-aware model loading
mechanism, which improves model utilization performance by enabling direct
computation on compressed tensors. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
NeurStore achieves superior compression ratios and competitive model loading
throughput compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

### [7] [A Novel IaaS Tax Model as Leverage Towards Green Cloud Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02767)
*Benedikt Pittl,Werner Mach,Erich Schikuta*

Main category: cs.DC

Result: 能源效率高的数据中心能够提供更便宜的服务价格，导致作业从能源效率低的数据中心向能效高的数据中心转移，从而降低整体能源消耗。

Conclusion: 经济税政手段是提升云数据中心能源效率的有效方法，GreenCloud税模型能够通过市场机制鼓励供应商投资更绿色的设施，实现能源效率的整体提升。

Abstract: The cloud computing technology uses datacenters, which require energy. Recent
trends show that the required energy for these datacenters will rise over time,
or at least remain constant. Hence, the scientific community developed
different algorithms, architectures, and approaches for improving the energy
efficiency of cloud datacenters, which are summarized under the umbrella term
Green Cloud computing. In this paper, we use an economic approach - taxes - for
reducing the energy consumption of datacenters. We developed a tax model called
GreenCloud tax, which penalizes energy-inefficient datacenters while fostering
datacenters that are energy-efficient. Hence, providers running
energy-efficient datacenters are able to offer cheaper prices to consumers,
which consequently leads to a shift of workloads from energy-inefficient
datacenters to energy-efficient datacenters. The GreenCloud tax approach was
implemented using the simulation environment CloudSim. We applied real data
sets published in the SPEC benchmark for the executed simulation scenarios,
which we used for evaluating the GreenCloud tax.

### [8] [Mycroft: Tracing Dependencies in Collective Communication Towards Reliable LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03018)
*Yangtao Deng,Lei Zhang,Qinlong Wang,Xiaoyun Zhi,Xinlei Zhang,Zhuo Jiang,Haohan Xu,Lei Wang,Zuquan Song,Gaohong Liu,Yang Bai,Shuguang Wang,Wencong Xiao,Jianxi Ye,Minlan Yu,Hong Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Mycroft系统，通过分布式追踪和根因分析来解决LLM训练中集体通信的可靠性问题，能在15秒内检测90%异常和20秒内确定60%根因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集体通信库如黑盒一样，隐藏了关键信息，导致LLM训练中的可靠性问题难以解决，造成资源浪费和模型性能降级。

Method: 设计Mycroft系统，追踪集体通信状态并利用内部控制和数据依赖关系来进行根因分析。这是一个轻量级的分布式追踪系统。

Result: 在字节跳动部署超过6个月，能在运行时调试集体通信相关问题。90%情况下15秒内检测异常，60%情况下20秒内确定根因。通过故障注入实验验证了系统能力。

Conclusion: Mycroft系统能够有效解决LLM训练中集体通信的可靠性问题，提高效率并减少资源浪费，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Reliability is essential for ensuring efficiency in LLM training. However,
many real-world reliability issues remain difficult to resolve, resulting in
wasted resources and degraded model performance. Unfortunately, today's
collective communication libraries operate as black boxes, hiding critical
information needed for effective root cause analysis. We propose Mycroft, a
lightweight distributed tracing and root cause analysis system designed to
address previously hidden reliability issues in collective communication.
Mycroft's key idea is to trace collective communication states and leverage
internal control and data dependencies to resolve reliability problems in LLM
training. Mycroft has been deployed at ByteDance for over six months to debug
collective communication related issues at runtime. It detected anomalies
within 15 seconds in 90% of cases and identified the root cause within 20
seconds in 60% of cases. We also conducted extensive fault injection
experiments to demonstrate Mycroft's capability and efficiency.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlashRecovery是一个快速低成本的故障恢复系统，通过实时故障检测、规模无关的任务重启和无检查点的一步恢复，显著提升大规模LLM训练的可靠性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型训练需要庞大的AI加速器集群和复杂的并行策略，硬件和软件故障会导致大量训练时间损失，需要解决长时间训练中的系统可靠性问题。

Method: 系统包含三个核心模块：1)主动实时故障检测，持续监控训练状态；2)规模无关任务重启，采用不同恢复策略和优化通信协议；3)无检查点一步恢复机制，完全消除对传统检查点方法的依赖。

Result: 实验结果显示，FlashRecovery能在150秒内恢复4800个设备的训练集群，且故障恢复时间在不同规模训练任务中保持基本一致。

Conclusion: FlashRecovery通过创新技术实现了最优的恢复时间目标和恢复点目标，大幅提升了长时间LLM训练的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made a profound impact across various
fields due to their advanced capabilities. However, training these models at
unprecedented scales requires extensive AI accelerator clusters and
sophisticated parallelism strategies, which pose significant challenges in
maintaining system reliability over prolonged training periods. A major concern
is the substantial loss of training time caused by inevitable hardware and
software failures. To address these challenges, we present FlashRecovery, a
fast and low-cost failure recovery system comprising three core modules: (1)
Active and real-time failure detection. This module performs continuous
training state monitoring, enabling immediate identification of hardware and
software failures within seconds, thus ensuring rapid incident response; (2)
Scale-independent task restart. By employing different recovery strategies for
normal and faulty nodes, combined with an optimized communication group
reconstruction protocol, our approach ensures that the recovery time remains
nearly constant, regardless of cluster scale; (3) Checkpoint-free recovery
within one step. Our novel recovery mechanism enables single-step restoration,
completely eliminating dependence on traditional checkpointing methods and
their associated overhead. Collectively, these innovations enable FlashRecovery
to achieve optimal Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective
(RPO), substantially improving the reliability and efficiency of long-duration
LLM training. Experimental results demonstrate that FlashRecovery system can
achieve training restoration on training cluster with 4, 800 devices in 150
seconds. We also verify that the time required for failure recovery is nearly
consistent for different scales of training tasks.

### [10] [The High Cost of Keeping Warm: Characterizing Overhead in Serverless Autoscaling Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03104)
*Leonid Kondrashov,Boxi Zhou,Hancheng Wang,Dmitrii Ustiugov*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文分析了无服务器计算系统中控制平面设计的性能-成本权衡，通过开源系统模拟商业平台行为，发现实例周转导致10-40%的CPU开销和2-10倍的内存浪费，并指出当前系统在减少开销时会导致性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无服务器计算正在改变云应用开发，但控制平面设计的性能-成本权衡由于缺乏跨平台基准测试和详细系统分析而未被充分理解。

Method: 设计近似商业提供商扩展行为的无服务器系统，通过重放真实工作负载和调整自动扩展参数，系统比较同步和异步自动扩展策略的性能和成本效率。采用混合方法结合真实控制平面部署和大规模仿真。

Result: 发现无服务器系统因实例周转产生显著计算开销（相当于请求处理CPU周期的10-40%），由于扩展策略导致高内存分配（比实际使用多2-10倍），且减少这些开销通常会导致性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前无服务器系统存在显著的资源开销问题，需要开发新的成本效益更高的自动扩展策略来平衡性能与成本效率。

Abstract: Serverless computing is transforming cloud application development, but the
performance-cost trade-offs of control plane designs remain poorly understood
due to a lack of open, cross-platform benchmarks and detailed system analyses.
In this work, we address these gaps by designing a serverless system that
approximates the scaling behaviors of commercial providers, including AWS
Lambda and Google Cloud Run. We systematically compare the performance and
cost-efficiency of both synchronous and asynchronous autoscaling policies by
replaying real-world workloads and varying key autoscaling parameters.
  We demonstrate that our open-source systems can closely replicate the
operational characteristics of commercial platforms, enabling reproducible and
transparent experimentation. By evaluating how autoscaling parameters affect
latency, memory usage, and CPU overhead, we reveal several key findings. First,
we find that serverless systems exhibit significant computational overhead due
to instance churn equivalent to 10-40% of the CPU cycles spent on request
handling, primarily originating from worker nodes. Second, we observe high
memory allocation due to scaling policy: 2-10 times more than actively used.
Finally, we demonstrate that reducing these overheads typically results in
significant performance degradation in the current systems, underscoring the
need for new, cost-efficient autoscaling strategies. Additionally, we employ a
hybrid methodology that combines real control plane deployments with
large-scale simulation to extend our evaluation closer to a production scale,
thereby bridging the gap between small research clusters and real-world
environments.

*Pengkun Ren,Hai Dong,Zahir Tari,Pengcheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 通过集成PVSS预提交机制的BFT协议，在4网络延迟内实现对1/2敌意参与者的容锐能力，提升了动态可用系统的延迟性能和链稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态可用系统中BFT共识协议在节点参与度波动时平衡延迟与安全性的挑战，现有方案多需多轮投票导致高延迟或容锐性不足

Method: 集成公开可验证秘密分享(PVSS)和预提交机制到消息传输中，通过PVSS绑定用户身份与消息，减少通信轮次

Result: 在常见场景下仅需4网络延迟(4Δ)，对1/2敌意参与者具有容锐能力，显著减少分叉出现次数，在中等参与度波动下保持更低延迟和更好的链稳定性

Conclusion: 该协议通过PVSS与预提交机制的创新集成，在不抑制完整性的前提下显著提升了BFT协议的效率和安全性，为动态可用系统提供了更优称的共识解决方案

Abstract: Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols for dynamically available
systems face a critical challenge: balancing latency and security in
fluctuating node participation. Existing solutions often require multiple
rounds of voting per decision, leading to high latency or limited resilience to
adversarial behavior. This paper presents a BFT protocol integrating a
pre-commit mechanism with publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) into
message transmission. By binding users' identities to their messages through
PVSS, our approach reduces communication rounds. Compared to other
state-of-the-art methods, our protocol typically requires only four network
delays (4$\Delta$) in common scenarios while being resilient to up to 1/2
adversarial participants. This integration enhances the efficiency and security
of the protocol without compromising integrity. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates the robustness of the protocol against Byzantine attacks.
Experimental evaluations show that, compared to traditional BFT protocols, our
protocol significantly prevents fork occurrences and improves chain stability.
Furthermore, compared to longest-chain protocol, our protocol maintains
stability and lower latency in scenarios with moderate participation
fluctuations.

*Amirhossein Shahbazinia,Darong Huang,Luis Costero,David Atienza*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CloudFormer是一个基于Transformer的双分支模型，用于在云环境黑盒条件下预测虚拟机性能退化，通过联合建模时间动态和系统级交互，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多租户云环境中虚拟机共享物理资源导致性能干扰问题严重，现有管理技术需要准确的性能预测，但在公有云黑盒环境下面临挑战。

Method: 提出CloudFormer双分支Transformer模型，利用206个系统指标以1秒分辨率建模时间动态和系统交互，无需场景特定调优即可适应不同工作负载条件。

Result: 实验表明CloudFormer在多个评估指标上持续优于现有基线方法，平均绝对误差仅为7.8%，比现有方法至少提升28%的预测准确性。

Conclusion: CloudFormer能够有效预测黑盒云环境中的性能退化，提供细粒度数据集支持，在不同工作负载下展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Cloud platforms are increasingly relied upon to host diverse,
resource-intensive workloads due to their scalability, flexibility, and
cost-efficiency. In multi-tenant cloud environments, virtual machines are
consolidated on shared physical servers to improve resource utilization. While
virtualization guarantees resource partitioning for CPU, memory, and storage,
it cannot ensure performance isolation. Competition for shared resources such
as last-level cache, memory bandwidth, and network interfaces often leads to
severe performance degradation. Existing management techniques, including VM
scheduling and resource provisioning, require accurate performance prediction
to mitigate interference. However, this remains challenging in public clouds
due to the black-box nature of VMs and the highly dynamic nature of workloads.
To address these limitations, we propose CloudFormer, a dual-branch
Transformer-based model designed to predict VM performance degradation in
black-box environments. CloudFormer jointly models temporal dynamics and
system-level interactions, leveraging 206 system metrics at one-second
resolution across both static and dynamic scenarios. This design enables the
model to capture transient interference effects and adapt to varying workload
conditions without scenario-specific tuning. Complementing the methodology, we
provide a fine-grained dataset that significantly expands the temporal
resolution and metric diversity compared to existing benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving robust generalization
across diverse and previously unseen workloads. Notably, CloudFormer attains a

### [13] [Sorting with constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02616)
*A. Manas*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 研究广义排序问题，在只能进行部分元素比较的情况下，基于禁止比较对形成的图的团数和色数来参数化算法，并扩展到非完全可排序图的部分序发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在只能进行有限元素比较的情况下如何高效完成排序或发现元素间部分序关系的问题，特别是在实际应用中无法进行所有可能比较的场景。

Method: 将问题建模为图论问题，通过分析禁止比较对形成的图的团数和色数来参数化算法复杂度，并设计算法处理非完全可排序图的部分序发现问题。

Result: 开发了一个简单算法，在输入图为Erdős–Rényi图时，总能以O(n^{3/2} log n)次探测确定底层部分序。

Conclusion: 该研究为广义排序问题提供了基于图论参数的算法框架，在有限比较约束下实现了高效的部分序发现，特别适用于随机图模型。

Abstract: In this work, we study the generalized sorting problem, where we are given a
set of $n$ elements to be sorted, but only a subset of all possible pairwise
element comparisons is allowed. We look at the problem from the perspective of
the graph formed by the ``forbidden'' pairs, and we parameterize algorithms
using the clique number and the chromatic number of this graph. We also extend
these results to the class of problems where the input graph is not necessarily
sortable, and one is only interested in discovering the partial order. We use
our results to develop a simple algorithm that always determines the underlying
partial order in $O(n^{3/2} \log n)$ probes, when the input graph is an
Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graph.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了LR-Aggregation算法，基于LR-tree数据结构和新颖的LR-distance，结合Pick-A-Perm算法，实现了动态排名聚合的高效解决方案，具有理论保证和优秀实践性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排名聚合问题在现实世界中有许多应用，在动态环境下需要高效更新聚合排名，现有方法在效率和理论保证方面存在不足。

Method: 开发LR-Aggregation算法（基于LR-tree和LR-distance），分析Pick-A-Perm算法的理论效率，并开发新数据结构将两者结合。

Result: 实验证明LR-Aggregation产生接近最优解，Pick-A-Perm具有理论最坏情况近似保证为2，两种算法组合可在O(n log n)时间内运行。

Conclusion: 这是第一个在动态设置中快速、接近线性时间的排名聚合算法，同时具有理论近似保证和优异的实际性能。

Abstract: The rank aggregation problem, which has many real-world applications, refers
to the process of combining multiple input rankings into a single aggregated
ranking. In dynamic settings, where new rankings arrive over time, efficiently
updating the aggregated ranking is essential. This paper develops a fast,
theoretically and practically efficient dynamic rank aggregation algorithm.
First, we develop the LR-Aggregation algorithm, built on top of the LR-tree
data structure, which is itself modeled on the LR-distance, a novel and
equivalent take on the classical Spearman's footrule distance. We then analyze
the theoretical efficiency of the Pick-A-Perm algorithm, and show how it can be
combined with the LR-aggregation algorithm using another data structure that we
develop. We demonstrate through experimental evaluations that LR-Aggregation
produces close to optimal solutions in practice. We show that Pick-A-Perm has a
theoretical worst case approximation guarantee of 2. We also show that both the
LR-Aggregation and Pick-A-Perm algorithms, as well as the methodology for
combining them can be run in $O(n \log n)$ time. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first fast, near linear time rank aggregation algorithm in the
dynamic setting, having both a theoretical approximation guarantee, and
excellent practical performance (much better than the theoretical guarantee).

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了三种近似算法来解决大规模图上的1-中位数问题，通过提前终止Dijkstra算法来减少计算量，在保持接近最优精度的同时显著提升运行效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统精确方法在大规模图上计算成本过高，而实际应用中客户节点数量相对较少且空间集中，不需要进行完整的图遍历

Method: 提出了三种基于提前终止Dijkstra算法的近似算法，通过理论分析证明其近似比分别为2和1.618

Result: 实验表明算法在运行时间上显著优于基线精确方法，在1000万节点的网格图上能在1毫秒内获得最优解，而基线方法需要70多秒

Conclusion: 所提算法能够有效解决大规模图上的1-中位数问题，在保证近似精度的同时大幅提升计算效率，特别适用于客户节点数量较少且集中的实际应用场景

Abstract: The 1-median problem (1MP) on undirected weighted graphs seeks to find a
facility location minimizing the total weighted distance to all customer nodes.
Although the 1MP can be solved exactly by computing the single-source shortest
paths from each customer node, such approaches become computationally expensive
on large-scale graphs with millions of nodes. In many real-world applications,
such as recommendation systems based on large-scale knowledge graphs, the
number of nodes (i.e., potential facility locations) is enormous, whereas the
number of customer nodes is relatively small and spatially concentrated. In
such cases, exhaustive graph exploration is not only inefficient but also
unnecessary. Leveraging this observation, we propose three approximation
algorithms that reduce computation by terminating Dijkstra's algorithm early.
We provide theoretical analysis showing that one of the proposed algorithms
guarantees an approximation ratio of 2, whereas the other two improve this
ratio to 1.618. We demonstrate that the lower bound of the approximation ratio
is 1.2 by presenting a specific instance. Moreover, we show that all proposed
algorithms return optimal solutions when the number of customer nodes is less
than or equal to three. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
significantly outperform baseline exact methods in runtime while maintaining
near-optimal accuracy across all tested graph types. Notably, on grid graphs
with 10 million nodes, our algorithms obtains all optimal solutions within 1
millisecond, whereas the baseline exact method requires over 70 seconds on
average.

TL;DR: 提出了一种非代数、保持局部性的三角形检测框架，在稀疏图中实现O(m log² n)时间复杂度和O(m log n)空间复杂度的高概率算法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏图中三角形检测问题，避免全局代数卷积方法可能破坏近线性计算或遇到细粒度障碍的问题，提供一种局部保持的高效检测方法

Method: 采用分层处理策略，将图分为O(log n)独立层，通过前缀分类和1-稀疏三元组维护，使用PK对齐发现潜在见证，并通过三阶段验证流程确保零假阳性

Result: 算法在O(m log² n)时间内以高概率完成三角形检测，峰值空间为O(m log n)，并生成可验证的Seeds+Logs证据

Conclusion: 该框架为稀疏图三角形检测提供了高效的非代数解决方案，通过局部性保持和概率放大技术实现了近乎最优的性能，并为Las Vegas和确定性变体奠定了基础

Abstract: We present a non-algebraic, locality-preserving framework for triangle
detection in worst-case sparse graphs. Our algorithm processes the graph in
$O(\log n)$ independent layers and partitions incident edges into prefix-based
classes where each class maintains a 1-sparse triple over a prime field.
Potential witnesses are surfaced by pair-key (PK) alignment, and every
candidate is verified by a three-stage, zero-false-positive pipeline: a
class-level 1-sparse consistency check, two slot-level decodings, and a final
adjacency confirmation. \textbf{To obtain single-run high-probability coverage,
we further instantiate $R=c_G\log n$ independent PK groups per class (each
probing a constant number of complementary buckets), which amplifies the
per-layer hit rate from $\Theta(1/\log n)$ to $1-n^{-\Omega(1)}$ without
changing the accounting.} A one-shot pairing discipline and class-term
triggering yield a per-(layer,level) accounting bound of $O(m)$, while
keep-coin concentration ensures that each vertex retains only $O(d^+(x))$ keys
with high probability. Consequently, the total running time is $O(m\log^2 n)$
and the peak space is $O(m\log n)$, both with high probability. The algorithm
emits a succinct Seeds+Logs artifact that enables a third party to replay all
necessary checks and certify a NO-instance in $\tilde O(m\log n)$ time. We also
prove a $\Theta(1/\log n)$ hit-rate lower bound for any single PK family under
a constant-probe local model (via Yao)--motivating the use of $\Theta(\log n)$
independent groups--and discuss why global algebraic convolutions would break
near-linear accounting or run into fine-grained barriers. We outline measured
paths toward Las Vegas $O(m\log n)$ and deterministic near-linear variants.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了一种在游程编码压缩字符串上进行字典匹配的新算法，无需解压缩即可高效处理模式匹配问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统字典匹配算法在处理压缩字符串时需要先解压缩，效率低下。研究目标是在不进行解压缩的情况下，直接在游程编码压缩的字符串上实现高效的字典匹配

Method: 使用新的压缩Aho-Corasick自动机表示方法和高效的字符串索引技术，支持在游程编码字符串上的快速查询

Result: 算法达到O((m̄+n̄)log log m + occ)期望时间复杂度和O(m̄)空间复杂度，其中m̄和n̄分别是模式和文本的游程编码块数，occ是匹配次数

Conclusion: 这是第一个非平凡的压缩字典匹配解决方案，时间复杂度在log log m因子内达到最优，为压缩字符串处理提供了新的技术途径

Abstract: Given a set of pattern strings $\mathcal{P}=\{P_1, P_2,\ldots P_k\}$ and a
text string $S$, the classic dictionary matching problem is to report all
occurrences of each pattern in $S$. We study the dictionary problem in the
compressed setting, where the pattern strings and the text string are
compressed using run-length encoding, and the goal is to solve the problem
without decompression and achieve efficient time and space in the size of the
compressed strings. Let $m$ and $n$ be the total length of the patterns
$\mathcal{P}$ and the length of the text string $S$, respectively, and let
$\overline{m}$ and $\overline{n}$ be the total number of runs in the run-length
encoding of the patterns in $\mathcal{P}$ and $S$, respectively. Our main
result is an algorithm that achieves $O( (\overline{m} + \overline{n})\log \log
m + \mathrm{occ})$ expected time, and $O(\overline{m})$ space, where
$\mathrm{occ}$ is the total number of occurrences of patterns in $S$. This is
the first non-trivial solution to the problem. Since any solution must read the
input, our time bound is optimal within an $\log \log m$ factor. We introduce
several new techniques to achieve our bounds, including a new compressed
representation of the classic Aho-Corasick automaton and a new efficient string
index that supports fast queries in run-length encoded strings.

TL;DR: 通过静态重构微服务源码为形式系统模型，利用SMT约束满足求解器进行形式验证，解决微服务系统在分布式开发中的维护性和可靠性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务系统在分布式开发和持续演进过程中容易出现沟通不畅和实现不兼容问题，影响系统维护性和可靠性

Method: 静态重构微服务源码为形式系统模型，从模型中派生SMT约束集，通过约束满足求解器进行形式验证

Result: 方法论支持多个横切关注点的软件验证，采用形式推理验证了方法论在系统架构关注点上的正确性和适用性

Conclusion: 提出了一种可扩展的形式验证方法论，为微服务系统的多种跨切关注点（如安全策略、系统架构）提供了验证支持，并建立了未来扩展和评估的方向

Abstract: Microservice systems are becoming increasingly adopted due to their
scalability, decentralized development, and support for continuous integration
and delivery (CI/CD). However, this decentralized development by separate teams
and continuous evolution can introduce miscommunication and incompatible
implementations, undermining system maintainability and reliability across
aspects from security policy to system architecture. We propose a novel
methodology that statically reconstructs microservice source code into a formal
system model. From this model, a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)
constraint set can be derived, enabling formal verification. Our methodology is
extensible, supporting software verification across multiple cross-cutting
concerns. We focus on applying the methodology to verify the system
architecture concern, presenting formal reasoning to validate the methodology's
correctness and applicability for this concern. Additional concerns such as
security policy implementation are considered. Future directions are
established to extend and evaluate the methodology.

*Fatih Pehlivan,Arçin Ülkü Ergüzen,Sahand Moslemi Yengejeh,Mayasah Lami,Anil Koyuncu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于提示工程的LLM评估方法，用于检测多语言代码库中的SOLID原则违反情况，测试了四种主流LLM模型和四种提示策略，发现GPT-4o Mini表现最佳但仍有挑战，提示策略对检测准确率有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态分析方法难以检测语义设计缺陷（如SOLID原则违反），现有解决方案通常只关注单个原则或特定语言，缺乏跨所有五个原则和多语言代码库的检测能力。

Method: 构建包含240个手动验证代码示例的新基准数据集，测试四种LLM模型（CodeLlama、DeepSeekCoder、QwenCoder、GPT-4o Mini）和四种提示策略（零样本、少样本、思维链、集成提示），系统评估其对SOLID原则违反检测准确率的影响。

Result: GPT-4o Mini明显优于其他模型，但在DIP等挑战性原则上仍有困难；提示策略对检测准确率有显著影响，但没有单一最佳策略；检测准确率受语言特性影响，并随代码复杂度增加而急剧下降。

Conclusion: 有效的AI驱动设计分析需要定制化方法，匹配适当的模型和提示策略到特定设计上下文，凸显了LLM通过AI辅助代码分析支持可维护性的潜力。

Abstract: Traditional static analysis methods struggle to detect semantic design flaws,
such as violations of the SOLID principles, which require a strong
understanding of object-oriented design patterns and principles. Existing
solutions typically focus on individual SOLID principles or specific
programming languages, leaving a gap in the ability to detect violations across
all five principles in multi-language codebases. This paper presents a new
approach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess
LLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. We
present a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder,
and GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID
principles. For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240
manually validated code examples. Using this dataset, we test four distinct
prompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and
chain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection
accuracy. Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with
GPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with
challenging principles like DIP. Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a
dramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a
deliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE
prompt is superior for DIP violations. Across all experiments, detection
accuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply
with increasing code complexity. These initial findings demonstrate that
effective, AI-driven design analysis requires not a single best model, but a
tailored approach that matches the right model and prompt to the specific
design context, highlighting the potential of LLMs to support maintainability
through AI-assisted code analysis.

Motivation: 电动汽车中的AI技术引入了新的安全保障挑战，传统ISO 26262评估方法无法有效评估AI基础功能，需要结合新标准来实现独立安全评估。

Method: 结合ISO 26262和ISO/PAS 8800标准，以AI驱动的电池电量状态(SOC)估计为例，通过系统性的故障注入实验来评估AI组件对输入变异的强固性。

Result: 识别了扩展评估方法的关键特征，通过注入受干扰传感器输入来测试AI组件的弹性和耐受能力。

Conclusion: 结合ISO 26262与ISO/PAS 8800的扩展评估框架可以有效地实现对电动汽车AI组件的独立安全评估，为汽车AI安全评估提供了可行的方法论证。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in electric vehicles (EV)
introduces unique challenges for safety assurance, particularly within the
framework of ISO 26262, which governs functional safety in the automotive
domain. Traditional assessment methodologies are not geared toward evaluating
AI-based functions and require evolving standards and practices. This paper
explores how an independent assessment of an AI component in an EV can be
achieved when combining ISO 26262 with the recently released ISO/PAS 8800,
whose scope is AI safety for road vehicles. The AI-driven State of Charge (SOC)
battery estimation exemplifies the process. Key features relevant to the
independent assessment of this extended evaluation approach are identified. As
part of the evaluation, robustness testing of the AI component is conducted
using fault injection experiments, wherein perturbed sensor inputs are
systematically introduced to assess the component's resilience to input
variance.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VulnRepairEval是一个基于PoC漏洞利用的评估框架，用于严格测试LLM在软件漏洞修复方面的真实能力，结果显示当前LLM表现不佳（仅21.7%成功率）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有漏洞修复评估方法主要依赖表面验证而非基于漏洞利用的功能验证，导致在安全敏感应用中高估了LLM的性能表现。

Method: 构建包含23个Python CVE的真实漏洞数据集，使用容器化评估管道进行可重现的差异评估，要求修复后原始漏洞利用必须失效。

Result: 评估12个流行LLM，表现最好的模型仅成功修复5/23个实例（21.7%），大多数失败源于漏洞识别不准确和补丁包含语法/语义错误。

Conclusion: 需要建立能够真实反映现实世界漏洞利用场景的严格评估协议，当前LLM在安全漏洞修复方面仍存在重大局限性。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated software
vulnerability patching has shown promising outcomes on carefully curated
evaluation sets. Nevertheless, existing datasets predominantly rely on
superficial validation methods rather than exploit-based verification, leading
to overestimated performance in security-sensitive applications. This paper
introduces VulnRepairEval, an evaluation framework anchored in functional
Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits. Our framework delivers a comprehensive,
containerized evaluation pipeline that enables reproducible differential
assessment, where repair success requires the original exploit to fail
execution against the modified code. The benchmark construction involved
extensive data curation: we processed over 400 CVEs and approximately 2,500
potential sources to extract a collection of authentic vulnerability instances
(23 Python CVEs) amenable to automated testing with working PoCs. Through
VulnRepairEval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 12 popular LLMs and
observe a significant performance deficit: even the top-performing model
successfully addresses merely 5/23 instances (about 21.7%), exposing critical
weaknesses in security-focused applications. Our failure analysis reveals that
most unsuccessful attempts stem from imprecise vulnerability identification and
patches containing syntactic or semantic errors. Enhanced prompting strategies
and multi-agent approaches yield minimal improvements, with overall
effectiveness remaining largely unaffected. This work contributes a stringent,
practical evaluation framework for LLM-driven vulnerability remediation and
underscores the necessity for assessment protocols that authentically reflect
real-world exploitation scenarios.

TL;DR: LADEX是一个基于LLM的迭代式生成-批判-优化流程，用于从自然语言描述中提取活动图，结合算法结构检查和LLM语义检查，显著提升了结构有效性和语义对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从自然语言描述自动生成模型时的两个关键问题：结构正确性（符合格式规则）和语义对齐性（准确反映源文本意图）。

Method: 使用LLM驱动的批判-优化流程，通过算法或LLM进行结构检查，LLM进行语义对齐检查，设计了五个消融变体来研究不同组件的影响。

Result: 实验表明：批判-优化循环比单次生成效果更好；算法结构检查比纯LLM检查平均提升正确率17.81%和完整度13.24%；结合算法结构检查和LLM语义检查达到最佳性能（正确率86.37%，完整度88.56%），平均只需不到5次LLM调用。

Conclusion: LADEX证明了结合算法结构检查和LLM语义检查的迭代方法在从自然语言生成活动图任务中的有效性，为自动化模型生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong potential for automating the
generation of models from natural-language descriptions. A common approach is
an iterative generate-critique-refine loop, where candidate models are
produced, evaluated, and updated based on detected issues. This process needs
to address: (1) structural correctness - compliance with well-formedness rules
- and (2) semantic alignment - accurate reflection of the intended meaning in
the source text. We present LADEX (LLM-based Activity Diagram Extractor), a
pipeline for deriving activity diagrams from natural-language process
descriptions using an LLM-driven critique-refine process. Structural checks in
LADEX can be performed either algorithmically or by an LLM, while alignment
checks are always performed by an LLM. We design five ablated variants of LADEX
to study: (i) the impact of the critique-refine loop itself, (ii) the role of
LLM-based semantic checks, and (iii) the comparative effectiveness of
algorithmic versus LLM-based structural checks.
  To evaluate LADEX, we compare the generated activity diagrams with
expert-created ground truths using trace-based operational semantics. This
enables automated measurement of correctness and completeness. Experiments on
two datasets indicate that: (1) the critique-refine loop improves structural
validity, correctness, and completeness compared to single-pass generation; (2)
algorithmic structural checks eliminate inconsistencies that LLM-based checks
fail to detect, improving correctness by an average of 17.81% and completeness
by 13.24% over LLM-only checks; and (3) combining algorithmic structural checks
with LLM-based semantic checks, implemented using the reasoning-focused O4
Mini, achieves the best overall performance - yielding average correctness of
up to 86.37% and average completeness of up to 88.56% - while requiring fewer
than five LLM calls on average.

Motivation: 移动应用性能严重依赖底层传输的拥塞控制设计，蜂窝链路带宽波动剧烈，需要更精确和及时的带宽测量方法。

Method: 提出Biscay系统，包含OpenDiag内核实时无线电KPI提取工具和基于KPI的精确带宽确定层，动态调整拥塞窗口以优化带宽利用。

Result: 在4G和5G场景的实验中，相比BBR和CUBIC等先进方案，平均和尾部延迟显著改善（通常降低90%以上），吞吐量相当或更好，OpenDiag的KPI测量粒度提升100%。

Conclusion: Biscay是一个实用且可部署的解决方案，通过在非root的Android 5G手机上实现，证明了其在实际移动网络环境中的有效性。

Abstract: Mobile application performance relies heavily on the congestion control
design of the underlying transport, which is typically bottlenecked by cellular
link and has to cope with rapid cellular link bandwidth fluctuations. We
observe that radio KPI measurements from the mobile device chipset can be
exploited for precise and timely measurement of available bandwidth on the
cellular link. Building on this insight, we propose Biscay, a practical and
radio KPI-driven congestion control system design for mobile networks. Biscay
leverages OpenDiag, the in-kernel real-time radio KPI extraction tool we
introduce in this paper, along with our KPI-based accurate bandwidth
determination layer towards dynamically adjusting the congestion window to
optimally use the available bandwidth while keeping delay to the minimum. Our
solution is practical and deployable, as shown through our implementation of
Biscay and OpenDiag on unrooted Android 5G phones. We extensively evaluate
Biscay against different state-of-the-art congestion control designs including
BBR and CUBIC with emulations driven by real measurement traces as well as
real-world experiments spanning diverse 4G and 5G scenarios, and show that it
provides significant average and tail delay improvements (typically over 90%
reduction) while yielding better or similar throughput. These gains are enabled
by 100% improvement in the granularity of on-device radio KPI measurements with
OpenDiag compared to existing alternatives like MobileInsight.

Conclusion: LoRa技术具备通过卫星网关支持物联网连接的潜力，但需要针对长距离通信中的碰撞问题进行网络优化设计。

Abstract: The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and Non-Terrestrial Networks
(NTNs) has emerged as a key paradigm to provide connectivity for sensors and
actuators via satellite gateways in remote areas where terrestrial
infrastructure is limited or unavailable. Among other Low-Power Wide-Area
Network (LPWAN) technologies for IoT, Long Range (LoRa) holds great potential
given its long range, energy efficiency, and flexibility. In this paper, we
explore the feasibility and performance of LoRa to support large-scale IoT
connectivity through Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite gateways. To do so, we
developed a new ns3-LoRa-NTN simulation module, which integrates and extends
the ns3-LoRa and ns3-NTN modules, to enable full-stack end-to-end simulation of
satellite communication in LoRa networks. Our results, given in terms of
average data rate and Packet Reception Ratio (PRR), confirm that LoRa can
effectively support direct communication from the ground to LEO satellites, but
network optimization is required to mitigate collision probability when end
nodes use the same Spreading Factors (SFs) over long distances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6GHz频段新开放给Wi-Fi使用，但需要AFC系统保护关键基础设施免受干扰。研究发现GPS定位报告机制存在安全风险

Method: 使用廉价商用无线电设备进行GPS欺骗攻击，在实验室环境中对商用AP和AFC系统进行测试验证

Result: 成功演示了通过GPS欺骗操纵AP行为，获得未授权频谱访问，造成有害干扰或完全禁用AP的能力

Conclusion: AFC系统的安全假设存在严重缺陷，需要更强的位置完整性保护机制

Abstract: The 6 GHz spectrum, recently opened for unlicensed use under Wi-Fi 6E and
Wi-Fi 7, overlaps with frequencies used by mission-critical incumbent systems
such as public safety communications and utility infrastructure. To prevent
interference, the FCC mandates the use of Automated Frequency Coordination
(AFC) systems, which assign safe frequency and power levels based on Wi-Fi
Access Point (AP)-reported locations. In this work, we demonstrate that
GPS-based location reporting, which Wi-Fi APs use, can be spoofed using
inexpensive, off-the-shelf radio equipment. This enables attackers to
manipulate AP behavior, gain unauthorized spectrum access, cause harmful
interference, or disable APs entirely by spoofing them into foreign locations.
We validate these attacks in a controlled lab setting against a commercial AP
and evaluate a commercial AFC system under spoofed scenarios. Our findings
highlight critical gaps in the security assumptions of AFC and motivate the
need for stronger location integrity protections.

TL;DR: 针对Open RAN多运营商共享部署中的安全盲点，提出了一个监控框架来主动验证配置状态和控制行为，确保符合租户定义的政策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open RAN的开放性和多厂商互操作性带来了新的安全挑战，特别是在多个移动网络运营商共享组件的部署中。现有的零信任架构假设认证组件会遵守操作政策，但存在配置错误或被入侵组件可能违反政策的盲点。

Method: 提出了一个监控框架，用于低信任度的O-RAN环境，主动验证配置状态和控制行为是否符合租户定义的政策。系统提供可扩展、可验证的监督。

Result: 使用标准化的O-RAN配置实现并评估了该框架，总处理延迟约为200毫秒，证明了其在多MNO部署中及时执行政策和合规审计的效率和实用性。

Conclusion: 该监控框架能够有效增强O-RAN操作的透明度和信任，解决了多运营商共享环境中的关键安全漏洞问题。

Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) is reshaping mobile network architecture
by promoting openness, disaggregation, and cross-vendor interoperability.
However, this architectural flexibility introduces new security challenges,
especially in deployments where multiple mobile network operators (MNOs)
jointly operate shared components. Existing Zero Trust Architectures (ZTA) in
O-RAN, as defined by governmental and industry standards, implicitly assume
that authenticated components will comply with operational policies. However,
this assumption creates a critical blind spot: misconfigured or compromised
components can silently violate policies, misuse resources, or corrupt
downstream processes (e.g., ML-based RIC xApps).
  To address this critical gap, we propose a monitoring framework for low-trust
O-RAN environments that proactively verifies configuration state and control
behavior against tenant-defined policies. Our system provides scalable,
verifiable oversight to enhance transparency and trust in O-RAN operations. We
implement and evaluate the framework using standardized O-RAN configurations,
with total processing latency of approximately 200 ms, demonstrating its
efficiency and practicality for timely policy enforcement and compliance
auditing in multi-MNO deployments.

Abstract: In the upcoming 6G era, the communication networks are expected to face
unprecedented challenges in terms of complexity and dynamics. Digital Twin (DT)
technology, with its various digital capabilities, holds great potential to
facilitate the transformation of the communication network from passive
responding to proactive adaptation. Thus, in this paper, we propose a
multi-layer DT system that coordinates local DT, edge DT, and cloud DT for
future network architecture and functions. In our vision, the proposed DT
system will not only achieve real-time data-driven decision-making and digital
agent functions previously handled by centralized DT, but will do so in a more
distributed, mobile, layer-by-layer manner. Moreover, it will supply essential
data, pre-trained models, and open interfaces for future metaverse
applications, enabling creators and users to efficiently develop and experience
metaverse services.

TL;DR: 基于O-RAN的主动异常检测框架，通过两种算法预测UE吞吐量下降和过滤异常小区，平均减少过手候选目41.27%，提高网络自恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 靠近关键服务对网络基础设施的依赖性不断增加，加上B5G/6G网络运维复杂性提升，必须开发主动自动化网络故障管理方案。O-RAN规范为AI/ML集成和主动网络健康监控提供了新机遇。

Method: 提出两种可行动异常检测算法：1）分析资源块利用率、信号质量等KPI指标，识别面临严重吞吐量下降风险的UE，启动主动过手候；2）评估邻小区无线覆盖质量，过滤信号强度或干扰水平异常的小区，减少过手候候选目。

Result: 算法平均减少过手候候选小区数量41.27%，有效减轻过手候失败和吞吐量下降问题，运行速度远快于近实时延迟要求。

Conclusion: 该框架为自恢复6G网络的实现排除了障碍，利用O-RAN规范与AI/ML技术提升了网络故障管理的主动性和自动化水平。

Abstract: The ever-increasing reliance of critical services on network infrastructure
coupled with the increased operational complexity of beyond-5G/6G networks
necessitate the need for proactive and automated network fault management. The
provision for open interfaces among different radio access network\,(RAN)
elements and the integration of AI/ML into network architecture enabled by the
Open RAN\,(O-RAN) specifications bring new possibilities for active network
health monitoring and anomaly detection. In this paper we leverage these
advantages and develop an anomaly detection framework that proactively detect
the possible throughput drops for a UE and minimize the post-handover failures.
We propose two actionable anomaly detection algorithms tailored for real-world
deployment. The first algorithm identifies user equipment (UE) at risk of
severe throughput degradation by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs)
such as resource block utilization and signal quality metrics, enabling
proactive handover initiation. The second algorithm evaluates neighbor cell
radio coverage quality, filtering out cells with anomalous signal strength or
interference levels. This reduces candidate targets for handover by 41.27\% on
average. Together, these methods mitigate post-handover failures and throughput
drops while operating much faster than the near-real-time latency constraints.
This paves the way for self-healing 6G networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ROS 2依赖DDS的20多个QoS策略，但用户缺乏安全策略组合和验证指导，导致试错调优和运行时故障。

Method: 分析DDS发布者-订阅者通信生命周期（发现、数据交换、解关联），提供16个QoS策略教程，推导QoS依赖链和41个依赖违规规则，开发QoS Guard工具进行离线静态验证。

Result: 提供了QoS策略的详细操作指南，形式化了策略间关系，分类了常见通信故障的约束条件，实现了无需建立实时ROS 2会话的安全预部署调优。

Conclusion: 这些贡献为ROS 2用户提供了概念性洞察和具体工具，能够早期检测错误配置，提高基于ROS 2的机器人系统的可靠性和资源效率。

Abstract: Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) relies on the Data Distribution Service
(DDS), which offers more than 20 Quality of Service (QoS) policies governing
availability, reliability, and resource usage. Yet ROS 2 users lack clear
guidance on safe policy combinations and validation processes prior to
deployment, which often leads to trial-and-error tuning and unexpected runtime
failures. To address these challenges, we analyze DDS Publisher-Subscriber
communication over a life cycle divided into Discovery, Data Exchange, and
Disassociation, and provide a user oriented tutorial explaining how 16 QoS
policies operate in each phase. Building on this analysis, we derive a QoS
dependency chain that formalizes inter-policy relationships and classifies 41
dependency violation rules, capturing constraints that commonly cause
communication failures in practice. Finally, we introduce QoS Guard, a ROS 2
package that statically validates DDS XML profiles offline, flags conflicts,
and enables safe, predeployment tuning without establishing a live ROS 2
session. Together, these contributions give ROS 2 users both conceptual insight
and a concrete tool that enables early detection of misconfigurations,
improving the reliability and resource efficiency of ROS 2 based robotic
systems.

low-altitude air corridors to guarantee safe operation and optimization.
Besides, we develop the multi-dimensional flight risk assessment through

collision avoidance for heterogeneous aircrafts. Finally, the open issues and
future directions are investigated to provide insights into HLAN development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长期神经元停用导致的训练不稳定问题，避免神经元复活时随机重新初始化带来的破坏性优化冲击。

Method: 提出生命周期(LC)原则，使用状态记忆机制，在神经元复活时恢复其上一次有效状态的参数，而非随机重新初始化。

Result: 理论分析显示该方法平滑了损失地形，导向更平坦的最小值；实验结果在图像分类任务上显示了改善的泛化性能和稳健性。

Conclusion: 状态记忆机制是获得性能改善的关键因素，生命周期原则通过保存学到的知识来提高正则化效果。

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for
extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like
Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge:
severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To
solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism
centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a
revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective
state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive
optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle
smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima
associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness.
Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for
achieving these gains.

Abstract: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching presents a critical
challenge, particularly in vast and partially observable environments where
real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the
context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) coordination in wildlife protection. By modeling hidden
environmental factors and inter-agent dynamics through latent variables, our
method enhances exploration and coordination under uncertainty.We implement and
evaluate our EM-MARL framework using a custom simulation involving 10 UAVs
tasked with patrolling protected habitats of the endangered Iranian leopard.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in detection
accuracy, adaptability, and policy convergence when compared to standard
algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG). Our findings underscore the potential of combining EM
inference with MARL to improve decentralized decisionmaking in complex,
high-stakes conservation scenarios. The full implementation, simulation
environment, and training scripts are publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 类别不平衡是机器学习中的基本挑战，传统解决方案常带来新问题。论文动机在找到比合成数据生成方法更简单、更可解释且更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用组感知阈值检测方法，为不同人口统计组设置不同的决策阈值。这种方法优化了平衡精度和最差组平衡精度之间的帕累托前沿，允许对组级别性能进行细粒度控制。

Result: 经过广泛实验，组特定阈值方法比SMOTE和CT-GAN增强模型实现了1.5-4%更高的平衡精度，同时改善了最差组平衡精度。结果涵盖七个模型家族，包括线性、树基、实例基和提升方法。

Conclusion: 组感知阈值检测提供了一种更简单、更可解释且更有效的类别不平衡解决方案。关键的发现是，将组阈值应用于合成增强数据上带来的额外收益最小，说明这些方法在根本上是重复的。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, with
traditional solutions often creating as many problems as they solve. We
demonstrate that group-aware threshold calibration--setting different decision
thresholds for different demographic groups--provides superior robustness
compared to synthetic data generation methods. Through extensive experiments,
we show that group-specific thresholds achieve 1.5-4% higher balanced accuracy
than SMOTE and CT-GAN augmented models while improving worst-group balanced
accuracy. Unlike single-threshold approaches that apply one cutoff across all
groups, our group-aware method optimizes the Pareto frontier between balanced
accuracy and worst-group balanced accuracy, enabling fine-grained control over
group-level performance. Critically, we find that applying group thresholds to
synthetically augmented data yields minimal additional benefit, suggesting
these approaches are fundamentally redundant. Our results span seven model
families including linear, tree-based, instance-based, and boosting methods,
confirming that group-aware threshold calibration offers a simpler, more
interpretable, and more effective solution to class imbalance.

Motivation: 公共卫生领域的序列资源分配问题具有复杂模糊目标和有限数据的挑战，需要开发能够处理偏好不确定性的鲁棒对齐方法

Method: DPO-PRO算法，在DPO基础上采用轻量级DRO公式来考虑偏好分布的不确定性，相比之前基于DRO的DPO方法保守性显著降低

Result: 在真实世界母婴移动健康项目和标准对齐基准测试中，DPO-PRO相比现有DPO变体对噪声偏好信号具有更好的鲁棒性，且与基于自反思的基线方法性能相当但推理成本显著降低

Conclusion: DPO-PRO为处理复杂公共卫生资源分配问题提供了一种有效且高效的奖励函数设计方法，在保持性能的同时大幅降低了计算成本

Abstract: We study an LLM fine-tuning task for designing reward functions for
sequential resource allocation problems in public health, guided by human
preferences expressed in natural language. This setting presents a challenging
testbed for alignment due to complex and ambiguous objectives and limited data
availability. We propose DPO-PRO, a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution using a lightweight Distributionally Robust
Optimization (DRO) formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based DPO methods, DPO-PRO is
significantly less conservative. We evaluate DPO-PRO on a real-world maternal
mobile health program operated by the non-profit organization ARMMAN, as well
as on standard alignment benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to
existing DPO variants. Moreover, DPO-PRO achieves comparable performance to
prior self-reflection-based baseline for reward function design, while
requiring significantly lower inference-time cost.

TL;DR: 论文提出Action Collapse现象，发现策略梯度方法中深度神经网络在特定约束下会出现类似神经坍缩的结构，并基于此提出了Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG)方法，通过固定ETF结构作为动作选择层来加速和稳定训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注策略网络的收敛性和全局最优性，但很少分析底层网络的表示结构。作者观察到在训练最优策略DNN时会出现类似神经坍缩的Action Collapse现象，这启发了使用ETF结构作为固定目标配置来学习最优策略的想法。

Method: 提出了Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG)方法，在动作选择层固定一个合成的等角紧框架(ETF)结构，诱导策略DNN产生理想的配置同时保持最优性。

Result: 在多个OpenAI Gym环境中的实验表明，ACPG可以集成到任何离散策略梯度方法中，能够更快、更稳定地获得更好的奖励改进。

Conclusion: 固定ETF结构作为动作选择层可以自然导致Action Collapse现象，ACPG方法通过利用这一现象实现了更快速和鲁棒的策略学习。

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently utilize
deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a shared backbone of feature
representations used to compute likelihoods in an action selection layer.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the convergence and global optima of
policy networks, but few have analyzed representational structures of those
underlying networks. While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that
under certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which
we refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the
state-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal
actions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)
the variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to
zero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations
collapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed
those aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since
the collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise
angles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:
can we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target
configuration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that
learning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads
to the AC. We thus propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method,
which accordingly affixes a synthetic ETF as our action selection layer. ACPG
induces the policy DNN to produce such an ideal configuration in the action
selection layer while remaining optimal. Our experiments across various OpenAI
Gym environments demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into any
discrete PG methods and lead to favorable reward improvements more quickly and
robustly.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This work explores the potential of foundation models, specifically a
Mamba-based selective state space model, for enhancing EEG analysis in
neurological disorder diagnosis. EEG, crucial for diagnosing conditions like
epilepsy, presents significant challenges due to its noisy, high-dimensional,
and nonlinear nature. Traditional machine learning methods have made advances
in automating EEG analysis but often fail to capture its complex
spatio-temporal dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in
sequence modeling, offer new avenues for creating more generalized and
expressive models capable of handling such complexities. By training a
Mamba-based model on a large dataset containing seizure and non-seizure EEG
recordings through a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure
detection task, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an AUROC of
0.72 on a held-out test set. This approach marks a significant step toward
developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data
analysis.

TL;DR: TopoMap是一种黑盒、模型无关的深度学习方法，通过维度缩减和聚类创建输入特征空间的拓扑地图，自动选择最优配置来区分不同故障特征，在变异测试中效果显著优于随机选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DL测试方法主要关注特定故障特征，但忽视了特征空间中不同区域的其它故障特征。需要一种系统性的方法来对输入特征空间进行拓扑映射，以全面识别和分组导致模型失败的输入特征。

Method: TopoMap采用黑盒方法，首先对输入进行维度缩减获得嵌入表示，然后进行聚类分析。使用深度神经网络作为人工评估器的近似，自动选择最优的嵌入/聚类配置来生成最具区分性的拓扑地图。

Result: TopoMap生成的拓扑地图包含可区分且有意义的区域。在变异分析中，TopoMap在可杀死变异体上平均比随机选择好35%，在不可杀死变异体上好61%。

Conclusion: TopoMap提供了一种有效的方法来系统性地探索和分组深度学习模型的故障特征，为DL系统测试提供了新的工具和视角，能够显著提高测试输入的效率和质量。

Abstract: Testing Deep Learning (DL)-based systems is an open challenge. Although it is
relatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping
of inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely
unexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may
focus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that
belong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an
explicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named
TopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features
that characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the
specific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain
input embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might
require specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a
meaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel
way to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering
techniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human
evaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based
on the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically
select the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are
produced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation
results show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and
meaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using
mutation analysis. In particular, we assess whether the clusters in our
topographical map allow for an effective selection of mutation-killing inputs.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms random selection by 35%
on average on killable mutants; by 61% on non-killable ones.

Motivation: 现有MoE剪枝方法主要减少内存使用但无法显著提升GPU推理性能，且固定激活专家数量导致计算冗余和次优性能

Method: LExI利用模型权重估计每层相对重要性，无需数据即可自适应确定每层最优激活专家数量

Result: 在语言和视觉MoE基准测试中，LExI显著优于传统剪枝方法，Qwen1.5-MoE在H100 GPU上达到相同吞吐量时精度提升10%

Conclusion: LExI提供了一种有效的MoE模型推理优化方案，通过层间专家数量自适应分配实现计算效率提升

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale efficiently by activating only a subset
of experts per token, offering a computationally sparse alternative to dense
architectures. While prior post-training optimizations, such as inter- and
intra-expert pruning, reduce memory usage they provide limited gains in
inference-time compute efficiency. Moreover, existing MoE architectures
typically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers,
resulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we
first demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint
but do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized
frameworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free
optimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per
layer in a pretrained MoE model. LExI leverages only the model weights to
estimate the relative importance of each layer and adaptively assigns the
number of active experts accordingly per layer. Experiments on state-of-the-art
language and vision MoE benchmarks demonstrate that LExI significantly
outperforms traditional MoE pruning approaches in terms of inference efficiency
with negligible accuracy loss. For example, using LExI, Qwen1.5-MoE achieves
the same throughput on Nvidia H100 GPU with 10% better accuracy than
traditional expert pruning.

Motivation: 为了解决从不同类型、不同稀疏度和分辨率的地下观测数据中重建地下属性的挑战，需要一种能够处理多模态数据并支持灵活扩展的模型架构。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，结合位置编码和模态编码（通过文本嵌入模型生成），支持八种模态（方向角度、分类类别、连续属性等），实现任意模态数量的扩展和上下文学习。

Conclusion: Transparent Earth作为地球地下的基础模型，能够预测地球上任何地方的地下属性，为地下属性重建提供了可扩展且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for
reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in
sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct
type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate
type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together
with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a
description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an
arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not
considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities
spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties
such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context
learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or
with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of
modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle
by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and
demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these
advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's
subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on
Earth.

Abstract: Existing approaches to predictive uncertainty rely either on multi-hypothesis
prediction, which promotes diversity but lacks principled aggregation, or on
ensemble learning, which improves accuracy but rarely captures the structured
ambiguity. This implicitly means that a unified framework consistent with the
loss geometry remains absent. The Structured Basis Function Network addresses
this gap by linking multi-hypothesis prediction and ensembling through
centroidal aggregation induced by Bregman divergences. The formulation applies
across regression and classification by aligning predictions with the geometry
of the loss, and supports both a closed-form least-squares estimator and a
gradient-based procedure for general objectives. A tunable diversity mechanism
provides parametric control of the bias-variance-diversity trade-off,
connecting multi-hypothesis generalisation with loss-aware ensemble
aggregation. Experiments validate this relation and use the mechanism to study
the complexity-capacity-diversity trade-off across datasets of increasing
difficulty with deep-learning predictors.

TL;DR: 提出通过归纳学习拉普拉斯特征向量来预训练图神经网络的新框架，解决传统MPNN因网络深度增加导致的过平滑问题，能更好地捕获全局和区域图结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消息传递神经网络(MPNN)随着网络深度增加容易出现过平滑风险，难以有效捕获全局和区域图结构。图拉普拉斯矩阵的低频特征向量编码了全局信息，通过预训练GNN预测这些特征向量可以鼓励网络自然学习图的大规模结构模式。

Method: 提出基于拉普拉斯特征向量学习的自监督预训练框架，通过让GNN预测图拉普拉斯矩阵的低频特征向量来学习图的结构模式。该方法适用于所有基于图的数据集，在任务特定数据稀疏时可以使用合成特征。

Result: 实验表明，通过该框架预训练的模型在各种基于图结构的任务上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该结构化的自监督预训练框架具有高度灵活性，能够有效提升GNN对图全局结构的建模能力，相比专注于领域特定任务的传统预训练方法更具通用性。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by
inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure
due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the
low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global
information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the
network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph.
Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform
baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most
existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge
feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is
structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all
graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when
task-specific data is sparse.

TL;DR: DP-SGD中的量化会导致比普通SGD更严重的精度下降，QPQuant通过动态量化层选择和损失感知优先级来减少量化方差，在保持隐私保护的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化技术虽然能大幅降低DP-SGD训练的时间和能耗成本，但噪声注入会放大量化方差，导致精度显著下降，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出QPQuant动态量化框架：1）每轮epoch概率性采样选择量化层；2）使用差分隐私损失敏感度估计器进行损失感知层优先级排序，识别对模型质量影响最小的层进行量化。

Result: 在ResNet18、ResNet50和DenseNet121上验证，QPQuant优于静态量化基线，达到接近帕累托最优的精度-计算权衡，理论吞吐量提升达2.21倍，验证精度下降小于2%。

Conclusion: QPQuant有效解决了DP-SGD中量化导致的精度下降问题，通过动态层选择和隐私保护的敏感度估计，在保持差分隐私保证的同时实现了高效的量化训练。

Abstract: Differentially-Private SGD (DP-SGD) is a powerful technique to protect user
privacy when using sensitive data to train neural networks. During training,
converting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,
quantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and
cost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that
quantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD
compared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in
DP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately
large accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a
dynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of
layers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that
effectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the
layers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware
layer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity
estimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model
quality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy
budget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,
and DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant
consistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near
Pareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical
throughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in
validation accuracy.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中冲突检测与冲突解决机制难以分离的挑战，以提升模型在复杂多模态场景下的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用线性探针进行监督度量分析和基于组的注意力模式分析，对LLaVA-OV-7B模型进行机制性研究。

Result: 发现模型中间层存在线性可解码的冲突信号，冲突检测和解决的注意力模式在网络不同阶段出现分化，证实了二者是功能上不同的机制。

Conclusion: 这种机制分解为实现更可操作的可解释性和针对性干预提供了可能，有助于提升模型在挑战性多模态环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper highlights the challenge of decomposing conflict detection from
conflict resolution in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and presents potential
approaches, including using a supervised metric via linear probes and
group-based attention pattern analysis. We conduct a mechanistic investigation
of LLaVA-OV-7B, a state-of-the-art VLM that exhibits diverse resolution
behaviors when faced with conflicting multimodal inputs. Our results show that
a linearly decodable conflict signal emerges in the model's intermediate layers
and that attention patterns associated with conflict detection and resolution
diverge at different stages of the network. These findings support the
hypothesis that detection and resolution are functionally distinct mechanisms.
We discuss how such decomposition enables more actionable interpretability and
targeted interventions for improving model robustness in challenging multimodal
settings.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型遗忘方法在彻底评估时效果不佳，需要更稳定有效的遗忘机制来确保模型安全，删除预训练中获得的私有数据或有害知识。

Method: 提出JensUn方法，利用Jensen-Shannon散度作为遗忘集和保留集的训练目标，相比常用损失函数能实现更稳定有效的遗忘动态。还引入了LKF数据集和基于LLM的语义评估方法。

Result: JensUn在广泛实验中比竞争方法获得更好的遗忘-效用权衡，表现出对良性重新学习的强韧性。新的评估框架显示许多现有方法效果不如之前认为的好。

Conclusion: JensUn提供了一种更有效的LLM遗忘方法，配合改进的评估框架，能够更准确地评估遗忘方法的真实效果，为模型安全提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) involves precisely removing
specific information from a pre-trained model. This is crucial to ensure safety
of LLMs by deleting private data or harmful knowledge acquired during
pre-training. However, existing unlearning methods often fall short when
subjected to thorough evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce JensUn, where
we leverage the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the training objective for both
forget and retain sets for more stable and effective unlearning dynamics
compared to commonly used loss functions. In extensive experiments, JensUn
achieves better forget-utility trade-off than competing methods, and even
demonstrates strong resilience to benign relearning. Additionally, for a
precise unlearning evaluation, we introduce LKF, a curated dataset of
lesser-known facts that provides a realistic unlearning scenario. Finally, to
comprehensively test unlearning methods, we propose (i) employing an LLM as
semantic judge instead of the standard ROUGE score, and (ii) using worst-case
unlearning evaluation over various paraphrases and input formats. Our improved
evaluation framework reveals that many existing methods are less effective than
previously thought.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肥胖是一个全球急需解决的健康问题，与多种慢性疾病相关。虽然机器学习已成为早期肥胖风险预测的有效方法，但对于集成技术（特别是混合多数投票和集成堆叠）的比较评估仍有限。

Method: 使用两个数据集评估三种集成模型：多数硬投票、权重硬投票和堆叠集成（以多层感知机作为元分类器）。分析了9种机器学习算法的50个超参数配置，选择前三个模型作为基学习器。预处理步骤包括数据集平衡和离群点检测，使用准确率和F1分数评估模型性能。

Conclusion: 结果证明集成堆叠方法具有更强的预测能力，特别是在复杂数据分布情况下，而混合多数投票仍然是一个健壮的备选方案。

Abstract: Obesity is a critical global health issue driven by dietary, physiological,
and environmental factors, and is strongly associated with chronic diseases
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Machine learning has
emerged as a promising approach for early obesity risk prediction, yet a
comparative evaluation of ensemble techniques -- particularly hybrid majority
voting and ensemble stacking -- remains limited. This study aims to compare
hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk
prediction, identifying which approach delivers higher accuracy and efficiency.
The analysis seeks to highlight the complementary strengths of these ensemble
techniques in guiding better predictive model selection for healthcare
applications. Two datasets were utilized to evaluate three ensemble models:
Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking (with a Multi-Layer
Perceptron as meta-classifier). A pool of nine Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, evaluated across a total of 50 hyperparameter configurations, was
analyzed to identify the top three models to serve as base learners for the
ensemble methods. Preprocessing steps involved dataset balancing, and outlier
detection, and model performance was evaluated using Accuracy and F1-Score. On
Dataset-1, weighted hard voting and stacking achieved nearly identical
performance (Accuracy: 0.920304, F1: 0.920070), outperforming majority hard
voting. On Dataset-2, stacking demonstrated superior results (Accuracy:
0.989837, F1: 0.989825) compared to majority hard voting (Accuracy: 0.981707,
F1: 0.981675) and weighted hard voting, which showed the lowest performance.
The findings confirm that ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive
capability, particularly for complex data distributions, while hybrid majority
voting remains a robust alternative.

Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this
gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online
conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We
prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under
minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6
synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 该TTC框架为更先进的PDE建模推理算法奠定了基础，包括构建基于强化学习的方法，可能彻底改变物理和工程领域的计算工作流程

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern
computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally
expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating
such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by
the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,
especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have
significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in
many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking"
strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first
test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational
resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer
training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of
reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for
spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible
Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures
improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive
inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced
reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building
reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational
workflows in physics and engineering.

Abstract: The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the
expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in
controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human
and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving
context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control
strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning
framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture
consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual
power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural
Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information
within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and
enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and
potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized
approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global
observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level
agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment
constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment
show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the
standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed
model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the
simulation-based Expert method.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in machine learning (ML),
particularly in the medical domain, where underrepresented minority classes
lead to biased models and reduced predictive performance. This study introduces
Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel data augmentation technique that
enhances the performance of ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Networks, by leveraging quantum
principles such as quantum evolution and layered entanglement. Unlike
conventional oversampling methods, QI-SMOTE generates synthetic instances that
preserve complex data structures, improving model generalization and
classification accuracy. We validate QI-SMOTE on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
datasets, using mortality detection as a benchmark task due to their clinical
significance and inherent class imbalance. We compare our method against
traditional oversampling techniques, including Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN,
SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TOMEK, and SVM-SMOTE, using key performance metrics such as
Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC. The results demonstrate that QI-SMOTE
significantly improves the effectiveness of ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA),
kernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches by producing more
informative and balanced training data. By integrating quantum-inspired
transformations into the ML pipeline, QI-SMOTE not only mitigates class
imbalance but also enhances the robustness and reliability of predictive models
in medical diagnostics and decision-making. This study highlights the potential
of quantum-inspired resampling techniques in advancing state-of-the-art ML
methodologies.

Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets that accurately reflect real-world
observational data is critical for evaluating causal estimators, but remains a
challenging task. Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing
synthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing
variation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of
confounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide
point estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed
estimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the
source data). This denies users the ability to express uncertainty over
parameter values and removes the potential for posterior inference, potentially
leading to unreliable estimator comparisons. We introduce simulation-based
inference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative
parameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source
dataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies
parameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with
the source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves
the reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,
which supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking
under uncertainty.

Abstract: Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic
aimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the
promising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of
elephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time
classification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our
previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting
resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and
computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection
technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically
for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were
conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average
(STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection
range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments.
Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a
Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across
multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73%
in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most
challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI
identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while
Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.

Abstract: Offloading footwear helps prevent and treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) by
lowering plantar pressure (PP), yet prescription decisions remain fragmented:
feature selection varies, personalization is limited, and evaluation practices
differ. We performed a narrative review of 45 studies (12 guidelines/protocols,
25 knowledge-based systems, 8 machine-learning applications) published to Aug
2025. We thematically analyzed knowledge type, decision logic, evaluation
methods, and enabling technologies. Guidelines emphasize PP thresholds (<=200
kPa or >=25--30\% reduction) but rarely yield actionable, feature-level
outputs. Knowledge-based systems use rule- and sensor-driven logic, integrating
PP monitoring, adherence tracking, and usability testing. ML work introduces
predictive, optimization, and generative models with high computational
accuracy but limited explainability and clinical validation. Evaluation remains
fragmented: protocols prioritize biomechanical tests; knowledge-based systems
assess usability/adherence; ML studies focus on technical accuracy with weak
linkage to long-term outcomes. From this synthesis we propose a five-part CDSS
framework: (1) a minimum viable dataset; (2) a hybrid architecture combining
rules, optimization, and explainable ML; (3) structured feature-level outputs;
(4) continuous validation and evaluation; and (5) integration with clinical and
telehealth workflows. This framework aims to enable scalable, patient-centered
CDSSs for DFU care; prioritizing interoperable datasets, explainable models,
and outcome-focused evaluation will be key to clinical adoption.

Conclusion: PDRL提供了一种简单高效的方法来解决集成方法在不确定性量化方面的高计算成本问题，同时避免了对已训练模型的影响。

Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs).
However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative
techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been
proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods
cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework
for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network
potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc
descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy
between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to
act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL
and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their
effectiveness and limitations.

### [54] [VendiRL: A Framework for Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning of Diversely Diverse Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02930)
*Erik M. Lintunen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了VendiRL框架，使用生态学中的Vendi Score度量技能多样性，解决了自监督强化学习中技能多样性的评估和扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督强化学习中，技能多样性学习面临两个主要挑战：高维特征空间中的可扩展性问题，以及缺乏统一的多样性评估标准导致结果难以比较。

Method: 采用Vendi Score作为多样性度量工具，开发了VendiRL框架，允许用户通过不同的相似性函数来定义和优化各种形式的技能多样性。

Result: VendiRL能够促进技能评估，并在新的丰富交互环境中支持多种多样性形式的技能预训练。

Conclusion: Vendi Score提供了一个灵活的多样性评估框架，VendiRL统一了技能多样性学习方法，为不同形式的多样性优化提供了理论基础和实践工具。

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is
learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.
Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent
issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured
by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across
downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what
constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific
notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to
inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across
different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity
unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity
that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --
allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We
demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,
a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given
distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity,
which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive
environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

TL;DR: 提出AR-KAN混合模型，结合KAN网络和自回归组件，解决非周期信号叠加问题，在72%的真实数据集上表现优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络和傅里叶神经网络在处理非周期信号叠加时存在局限，特别是在预测具有不可通约频率的准周期函数时，传统ARIMA模型往往优于神经网络

Method: 提出Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN混合模型，使用Kolmogorov-Arnold Network处理静态非线性部分，通过预训练的自回归组件引入记忆机制，保留有用信息并消除冗余

Result: 实验数据显示AR-KAN在72%的真实世界数据集上取得了优越的结果

Conclusion: AR-KAN模型成功解决了非周期信号叠加的挑战，结合了神经网络和传统时间序列方法的优势，在准周期函数预测方面表现出色

Abstract: Conventional neural networks frequently face challenges in spectral analysis
of signals. To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and
similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of
neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the
superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic
signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of
signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most
neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we
propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the
benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply
a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include
memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the
most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data
indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world
datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了D-Byz-SGDM方法，通过延迟动量聚合解决联邦学习中部分参与下的拜占庭攻击问题，在理论和实验上都证明了有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拜占庭鲁棒联邦学习方法假设全客户端参与，但在实际通信约束和客户端可用性下只能部分参与，当采样客户端包含拜占庭多数时会失败

Method: 引入延迟动量聚合原则，服务器聚合非参与客户端的最新接收梯度与活跃客户端的实时动量，开发D-Byz-SGDM优化器

Result: 建立了收敛保证，恢复了全参与结果并匹配部分参与设置的下界，深度学习实验验证了在各种拜占庭攻击下的稳定鲁棒训练

Conclusion: 延迟动量聚合是解决部分参与联邦学习中拜占庭攻击的有效方法，D-Byz-SGDM在理论和实践上都表现出色

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy, but it remains vulnerable to Byzantine
clients that exhibit malicious behavior. While existing Byzantine-robust FL
methods provide strong convergence guarantees (e.g., to a stationary point in
expectation) under Byzantine attacks, they typically assume full client
participation, which is unrealistic due to communication constraints and client
availability. Under partial participation, existing methods fail immediately
after the sampled clients contain a Byzantine majority, creating a fundamental
challenge for sparse communication. First, we introduce delayed momentum
aggregation, a novel principle where the server aggregates the most recently
received gradients from non-participating clients alongside fresh momentum from
active clients. Our optimizer D-Byz-SGDM (Delayed Byzantine-robust SGD with
Momentum) implements this delayed momentum aggregation principle for
Byzantine-robust FL with partial participation. Then, we establish convergence
guarantees that recover previous full participation results and match the
fundamental lower bounds we prove for the partial participation setting.
Experiments on deep learning tasks validated our theoretical findings, showing
stable and robust training under various Byzantine attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaGO结合了正交化动量更新和AdaGrad自适应学习率的优势，在保持正交更新方向的同时通过累积梯度范数自适应调整步长，在理论和实验上都优于Muon和Adam。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器通过正交化动量更新在大型语言模型训练中表现优异，但缺乏自适应学习率机制；而AdaGrad虽然能自适应调整步长，但更新方向不够优化。需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出AdaGO算法，将基于范数的AdaGrad型步长与正交化更新方向相结合，仅需增加一个标量变量（累积平方梯度范数）即可实现，计算和内存效率高。

Result: 在非凸函数的随机和确定性设置下建立了最优理论收敛速率，在CIFAR-10分类和函数回归任务上的实验结果表明AdaGO优于Muon和Adam。

Conclusion: AdaGO成功融合了正交化更新和自适应学习率的优势，既保持了Muon的谱下降方向特性，又获得了AdaGrad的自适应能力，是一个高效且理论保证的优化算法。

Abstract: The recently proposed Muon optimizer updates weight matrices via
orthogonalized momentum and has demonstrated strong empirical success in large
language model training. However, it remains unclear how to determine the
learning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a
widely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated
past gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based
AdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing
together the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of
Muon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be
interpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to
the optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past
gradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification
to Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared
gradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient.
Optimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions
in both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and
unbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10
classification and function regression demonstrate that AdaGO outperforms Muon
and Adam.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠分期模型在部署到具有未见生理特征或记录条件的患者时性能会下降，需要一种无需源数据或患者校准的实用自适应方法。

Method: 流式无源测试时自适应方法，结合熵最小化(Tent)、批归一化统计刷新，以及两个安全机制：熵门控(暂停不确定窗口的自适应)和EMA重置(防止漂移)。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF Expanded数据集上，使用单导联EEG，相比冻结基线模型在秒级延迟和最小内存占用下获得一致性能提升，报告了各阶段指标和Cohen's k。

Conclusion: 该方法模型无关，无需源数据或患者校准，适用于设备端或床旁使用，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Sleep staging models often degrade when deployed on patients with unseen
physiology or recording conditions. We propose a streaming, source-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) recipe that combines entropy minimization (Tent)
with Batch-Norm statistic refresh and two safety rails: an entropy gate to
pause adaptation on uncertain windows and an EMA-based reset to reel back
drift. On Sleep-EDF Expanded, using single-lead EEG (Fpz-Cz, 100 Hz, 30s
epochs; R&K to AASM mapping), we show consistent gains over a frozen baseline
at seconds-level latency and minimal memory, reporting per-stage metrics and
Cohen's k. The method is model-agnostic, requires no source data or patient
calibration, and is practical for on-device or bedside use.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种多模态数据融合方法，结合高成本X射线数据和低成本吸收率数据来预测激光粉末床熔融过程中的熔池动力学，通过迁移学习实现仅用吸收率数据就能准确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监测方法中，X射线成像成本高且不实用，而低成本光电二极管的吸收率数据噪声大且单独使用时预测精度不足，需要一种既能利用高质量数据又能实现低成本实时监测的方法。

Method: 使用多模态学习框架，结合CNN提取X射线数据的空间特征和RNN提取吸收率信号的时间特征，采用早期融合策略，并作为迁移学习模型来微调仅使用吸收率数据的RNN模型。

Result: 多模态训练显著提高了预测精度，训练后的模型仅需吸收率数据就能推断熔池特征，无需昂贵X射线成像。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了成本效益高的实时监测，在增材制造领域具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive
manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For
example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about
subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial
settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate
with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when
used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for
predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with
low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.
Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,
using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a
transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool
dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the
multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly
improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone.
Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using
only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This
multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has
broad applicability in additive manufacturing.

Conclusion: 该算法在存在共同噪声的情况下表现出鲁棒性和适应性，能够适应不同的初始分布和噪声源。

Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale
multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a
challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or
when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an
efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve
population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical
sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting
policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common
noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we
demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties
compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of
Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the
presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our
approach.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated
scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from
experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of
integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's
generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by
incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized
formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only
to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the
contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim
to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual
intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of
scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,
adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We
extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and
PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three
physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic
wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the
reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR
models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt
engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve
performance.

Motivation: 大语言模型需要大量内存和计算资源，二进制量化能大幅降低存储和推理成本，但传统二进制量化导致显著性能下降。

Method: 提出了一种专门为二进制量化设计的新题优化目标，以及三种实现该目标的算法，通过动态识别最优的非结构化子矩阵和适配分组策略来改进块量化。

Result: 量化后的LLaMA 3.2 3B模型达到迷失率8.23（原始为7.81），超越之前最佳二进制量化方法BiLLM（迷失率123.90），并与4比特方法GPTQ竞争。压缩效率极高，单CPU核仅14秒完成全部量化，整个过程小于100分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效的二进制量化解决方案，在极低的比特长度下保持了优异的模型性能，具有良好的并行性能和实用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require
substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which
compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in
{-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However,
such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation
compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we
propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along
with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances
blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured
sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007
bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA
3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original
7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90.
Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ
in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly
efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights
on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes
and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

Motivation: 为了通过离散几何结构来理解深度ReLU网络的功能行为，提供统一的分析框架来理解、诊断和改善泛化性能力。

Method: 扩展ReLU过渡图(RTG)框架，每个节点代表一个线性激活区域，边连接相差仅一个ReLU激活翻转的区域，形成离散几何结构。

Result: 证明了RTG在随机初始化时具有强扩展性、二项度分布和汇照性质，区域熵在过参数化时饱和，汇照间隔与泛化性相关，相邻区域间的KL散度反映功能平滑性。

Conclusion: 该工作通过离散功能几何视角提供了分析ReLU网络的统一框架，为理解、诊断和改善泛化性提供了新工具。

Abstract: We extend the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG) framework into a comprehensive
graph-theoretic model for understanding deep ReLU networks. In this model, each
node represents a linear activation region, and edges connect regions that
differ by a single ReLU activation flip, forming a discrete geometric structure
over the network's functional behavior. We prove that RTGs at random
initialization exhibit strong expansion, binomial degree distributions, and
spectral properties that tightly govern generalization. These structural
insights enable new bounds on capacity via region entropy and on generalization
via spectral gap and edge-wise KL divergence. Empirically, we construct RTGs
for small networks, measure their smoothness and connectivity properties, and
validate theoretical predictions. Our results show that region entropy
saturates under overparameterization, spectral gap correlates with
generalization, and KL divergence across adjacent regions reflects functional
smoothness. This work provides a unified framework for analyzing ReLU networks
through the lens of discrete functional geometry, offering new tools to
understand, diagnose, and improve generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their
reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like
mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be
automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other
reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of
high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In
this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for
scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of
reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)
LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples
across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired
with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic
data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to
produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an
agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based
agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align
with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad
suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and
reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,
difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at

Motivation: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)虽然能通过最小化损失和锐度来改善深度神经网络的泛化能力，但在分布式大批次训练中存在效率低下的问题

Method: LSAM将SAM的对抗性步骤与异步分布式采样策略相结合，生成异步分布式采样方案，产生平滑的锐度感知损失景观进行优化

Conclusion: LSAM在保持SAM泛化优势的同时，为分布式大批次训练提供了显著更高的效率

Abstract: While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in deep
neural networks by minimizing both loss and sharpness, it suffers from
inefficiency in distributed large-batch training. We present Landscape-Smoothed
SAM (LSAM), a novel optimizer that preserves SAM's generalization advantages
while offering superior efficiency. LSAM integrates SAM's adversarial steps
with an asynchronous distributed sampling strategy, generating an asynchronous
distributed sampling scheme, producing a smoothed sharpness-aware loss
landscape for optimization. This design eliminates synchronization bottlenecks,
accelerates large-batch convergence, and delivers higher final accuracy
compared to data-parallel SAM.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DHCP的分层深度强化学习模型，用于交通信号控制，通过高层代理分配南北和东西方向的总周期时间，低层代理进一步分配直行和左转的时间，解决了传统方法在相位选择和安全性与效率之间的权衡问题。

Motivation: 现有的深度强化学习交通信号控制方法存在两种主要范式："选择相位"可能导致不可预测的相位序列影响驾驶员安全，"切换"范式虽然保持可预测性但可能导致相位分配不公平和低效。需要一种既能保持可预测性又能灵活分配时间的方法。

Conclusion: DHCP模型通过分层周期时间分配，成功解决了传统交通信号控制方法在安全性、可预测性和效率之间的权衡问题，实现了更好的交通信号控制性能。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic
signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex
traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control
paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in
the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this
paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their
anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,
the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next
predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a
more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase
allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while
others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep
Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle
duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the
total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions
based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the
allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn
movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our
model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of
real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the

TL;DR: 使用人工智能框架结合数值谱模拟和深度学习，实现了无标准的自动化多核素TDCR谱分析，充分解决了多核素分析中的自动化限制和标准依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 液体闪烁TDCR谱以其高精度和自标定能力成为核素定量标准方法，但多核素分析面临自动化不足和依赖混合物标准的挑战。

Method: 结合Geant4模拟与统计检测器响应采样生成β谱数据，构建专门的神经网络结构进行训练，覆盖不同核素比例和氨化场景。

Result: 模型在活度比例(均值绝对误差=0.009)、检测效率(均值绝对误差=0.002)和谱图重建(结构相似性指数=0.9998)任务中都表现出高精度。

Conclusion: 这种AI驱动方法具有强大的演绎性、实时处理能力和工程可行性，尤其适用于缺乏参照材料或需要快速现场分析的场景。

Abstract: Liquid scintillation triple-to-doubly coincident ratio (TDCR) spectroscopy is
widely adopted as a standard method for radionuclide quantification because of
its inherent advantages such as high precision, self-calibrating capability,
and independence from radioactive reference sources. However, multiradionuclide
analysis via TDCR faces the challenges of limited automation and reliance on
mixture-specific standards, which may not be easily available. Here, we present
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that combines numerical spectral
simulation and deep learning for standard-free automated analysis. $\beta$
spectra for model training were generated using Geant4 simulations coupled with
statistically modeled detector response sampling. A tailored neural network
architecture, trained on this dataset covering various nuclei mix ratio and
quenching scenarios, enables autonomous resolution of individual radionuclide
activities and detecting efficiency through end-to-end learning paradigms. The
model delivers consistent high accuracy across tasks: activity proportions
(mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error =
0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998),
validating its physical plausibility for quenched $\beta$ spectroscopy. This
AI-driven methodology exhibits significant potential for automated
safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization,
real-time processing capabilities, and engineering feasibility, particularly in
scenarios where reference materials are unavailable or rapid field analysis is
required.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次实证量化了自动驾驶场景中可解释AI的Rashomon效应，发现不同模型对同一预测提供差异显著的解释，说明解释歧义是问题的固有属性而非建模缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶等安全关键应用中，可解释AI(XAI)的可靠性受到Rashomon效应的挑战——多个同样准确的模型可能对同一预测提供不同的解释。需要量化这种效应以验证XAI的可信度。

Method: 使用定性可解释图(QXGs)作为符号场景表示，训练两类模型的Rashomon集合：可解释的基于对的梯度提升模型和复杂的基于图的图神经网络(GNNs)，通过特征归因方法测量模型内部和模型间的解释一致性。

Result: 结果显示存在显著的解释分歧，不同模型对同一预测的解释差异很大。

Conclusion: 解释歧义是动作预测问题的固有属性，而不仅仅是建模方法的产物，这对安全关键应用中XAI的可靠性提出了重要挑战。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for validating and trusting models in
safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. However, the reliability
of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate
models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper
provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of
action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable
Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two
distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and
complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution
methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these
classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings
suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not
just a modeling artifact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有归因方法评估协议存在阈值选择偏差，单一阈值的选择可能导致方法排名反转和结论错误，影响方法评估的可靠性和一致性。

Method: 提出了一种无阈值的评价框架，通过计算交并比聚合曲线下面积(AUC-IoU)来评估归因质量，考察全部阈值范围内的表现。对七种归因方法在皮肤病影像数据上进行了评估。

Result: 无阈值评估框架能够提供可靠的方法差异化结果：XRAI比LIME提升30%，比零风格积分提升204%。样本大小分层分析显示不同病变规模下性能差异达269%。而单一阈值指标会产生矛盾的结果。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了消除评估偏差的方法标准，为医学影像及其他领域的归因方法选择提供了基于证据的指导。无阈值框架既提供了归因行为的理论见解，也为稳健比较提供了实践指南。

Abstract: Attribution methods explain neural network predictions by identifying
influential input features, but their evaluation suffers from threshold
selection bias that can reverse method rankings and undermine conclusions.
Current protocols binarize attribution maps at single thresholds, where
threshold choice alone can alter rankings by over 200 percentage points. We
address this flaw with a threshold-free framework that computes Area Under the
Curve for Intersection over Union (AUC-IoU), capturing attribution quality
across the full threshold spectrum. Evaluating seven attribution methods on
dermatological imaging, we show single-threshold metrics yield contradictory
results, while threshold-free evaluation provides reliable differentiation.
XRAI achieves 31% improvement over LIME and 204% over vanilla Integrated
Gradients, with size-stratified analysis revealing performance variations up to
269% across lesion scales. These findings establish methodological standards
that eliminate evaluation artifacts and enable evidence-based method selection.
The threshold-free framework provides both theoretical insight into attribution
behavior and practical guidance for robust comparison in medical imaging and
beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索TabPFN基础模型在地质工程数据预测中的应用潜力，解决传统分层贝叶斯模型计算效率低的问题

Method: 采用零训练、少样本、上下文学习方式，无需调参，利用大量间接数据库作为额外上下文信息

Result: 在副切强度预测任务中超过HBM预测准确性且运行速度提升10倍；在缺失值揕补任务中所有参数RMSE更低，但计算成本更高

Conclusion: TabPFN作为通用基础模型在地质工程预测中表现优异，可能带来概率性地质特征分析的范式转变

Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted
Network (TabPFN) - a transformer-based foundation model for tabular data - to
geotechnical site characterization problems defined in the GEOAI benchmark
BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025. Two tasks are addressed: (1) predicting the
spatial variation of undrained shear strength (su) across borehole depth
profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site
dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning
setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional
context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that
TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and
well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional
hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant
gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction),
TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an
order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical
parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target
parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative
computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time
inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation
model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in
probabilistic site characterization.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的公平决策树研究主要集中在将敏感属性纳入目标函数的单一方法上，而忽略了其他可能的设计空间选项，特别是基于约束的方法和双树独立建模方法。

Method: 提出了三种决策树公平性学习框架：(1)目标函数同时优化预测性能和公平性；(2)在预测性能优化的基础上添加公平性约束；(3)构建两个独立的树分别建模目标变量和敏感属性。重点研究了后两种之前未被充分探索的方法。

Result: 实验表明，约束方法和双树方法在多个数据集上都能有效平衡预测性能和公平性要求，提供了比传统单一目标函数方法更灵活的解决方案。

Conclusion: 决策树公平性学习存在多种可行的设计范式，约束优化和双独立树建模是有效且值得进一步研究的方向，为公平机器学习提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Decision trees have been studied extensively in the context of fairness,
aiming to maximize prediction performance while ensuring non-discrimination
against different groups. Techniques in this space usually focus on imposing
constraints at training time, constraining the search space so that solutions
which display unacceptable values of relevant metrics are not considered,
discarded, or discouraged. If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive
attribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as
follows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function
that is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on
the weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)
The second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function
in y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the
objective, but part of a constraint. This can be achieved greedily by aborting
a further split as soon as the condition that optimizes the objective in y
fails to satisfy the constraint on s. A simple way to explore other splits is
to backtrack during tree construction once a fairness constraint is violated.
(iii) The third option is to have two trees T_y and T_s, one for y and one for
s, such that the tree structure for y and s does not have to be shared. In this
way, information regarding y and regarding s can be used independently, without
having to constrain the choices in tree construction by the mutual information
between the two variables. Quite surprisingly, of the three options, only the
first one and the greedy variant of the second have been studied in the
literature so far. In this paper, we introduce the above two additional options
from that design space and characterize them experimentally on multiple
datasets.

Result: 通过实证评估证明，该算法克服了智能体初始偏见的限制，促进了更多探索行为，在各种挑战性环境中表现出更优越的性能

Conclusion: 整合对比学习的GCSL框架能够有效解决自我模仿学习的局限性，通过从成功和失败中学习，实现更好的策略识别和采用

Abstract: Reinforcement learning faces significant challenges when applied to tasks
characterized by sparse reward structures. Although imitation learning, within
the domain of supervised learning, offers faster convergence, it relies heavily
on human-generated demonstrations. Recently, Goal-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (GCSL) has emerged as a potential solution by enabling self-imitation
learning for autonomous systems. By strategically relabelling goals, agents can
derive policy insights from their own experiences. Despite the successes of
this framework, it presents two notable limitations: (1) Learning exclusively
from self-generated experiences can exacerbate the agents' inherent biases; (2)
The relabelling strategy allows agents to focus solely on successful outcomes,
precluding them from learning from their mistakes. To address these issues, we
propose a novel model that integrates contrastive learning principles into the
GCSL framework to learn from both success and failure. Through empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes limitations imposed by
agents' initial biases and thereby enables more exploratory behavior. This
facilitates the identification and adoption of effective policies, leading to
superior performance across a variety of challenging environments.

TL;DR: TeRA是一种新颖的参数高效微调方法，通过张量网络实现高秩权重更新，同时保持向量化方法的参数效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LoRA风格适配器在高秩表达性和参数效率之间的权衡问题，高秩适配器需要更多参数，而向量化方法参数效率高但表达能力有限

Method: 使用Tucker-like张量网络参数化权重更新矩阵，冻结大型随机初始化因子并在层间共享，仅训练由对角因子矩阵条目组成的小型层特定缩放向量

Result: TeRA在性能上匹配甚至超越高秩适配器，同时所需的可训练参数数量与向量化方法相当

Conclusion: TeRA成功实现了高秩权重更新与参数效率的平衡，理论分析和消融研究验证了该方法的有效性

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style
adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model
expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter
reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches
present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates
typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency
offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a
vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for
high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel
PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the
parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by
parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor
network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared
across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by
entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively
decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable
parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even
outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count
similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件检测评估指标(如F1和F1$_{pa}$)在实际应用中存在问题，特别是当地面真实标注为单点事件而实际现象是渐进性时，这些指标容易误导模型性能评估。

Method: 提出了窗口基于F1指标(F1$_w$)，该指标结合了时间宽容机制，允许在不完美对齐的情况下进行更稳健的事件检测评估。在三个生理数据集(包括两个野外数据集和一个实验数据集)中进行实验分析。

Result: 结果显示F1$_w$能够揭示传统指标无法发现的有意义模型性能模式。在两个野外应用场景中，只有这种时间宽容指标能够显示TimesFM预测结果较随机和空基准有统计学上显著的收益。

Conclusion: 该研究解决了时间序列评估中的关键空白，为健康养护应用提供了实用指南，特别是在不同上下文对时间精度要求不同的场景下。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of event detection in time series is essential for
applications such as stress monitoring with wearable devices, where ground
truth is typically annotated as single-point events, even though the underlying
phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused. Standard metrics like F1 and
point-adjusted F1 (F1$_{pa}$) often misrepresent model performance in such
real-world, imbalanced datasets. We introduce a window-based F1 metric (F1$_w$)
that incorporates temporal tolerance, enabling a more robust assessment of
event detection when exact alignment is unrealistic. Empirical analysis in
three physiological datasets, two in-the-wild (ADARP, Wrist Angel) and one
experimental (ROAD), indicates that F1$_w$ reveals meaningful model performance
patterns invisible to conventional metrics, while its window size can be
adapted to domain knowledge to avoid overestimation. We show that the choice of
evaluation metric strongly influences the interpretation of model performance:
using predictions from TimesFM, only our temporally tolerant metrics reveal
statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in the
two in-the-wild use cases. This work addresses key gaps in time series
evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where
requirements for temporal precision vary by context.

Abstract: The increasing demand for high data rates and seamless connectivity in
wireless systems has sparked significant interest in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) and artificial intelligence-based wireless applications. RIS
typically comprises passive reflective antenna elements that control the
wireless propagation environment by adequately tuning the phase of the
reflective elements. The allocation of RIS elements to multipleuser equipment
(UEs) is crucial for efficiently utilizing RIS. In this work, we formulate a
joint optimization problem that optimizes the RIS phase configuration and
resource allocation under an $\alpha$-fair scheduling framework and propose an
efficient way of allocating RIS elements. Conventional iterative optimization
methods, however, suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity
as the number of RIS elements increases and also complicate the generation of
training labels for supervised learning. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a five-layer fully connected neural network (FNN) combined with a
preprocessing technique to significantly reduce input dimensionality, lower
computational complexity, and enhance scalability. The simulation results show
that our proposed NN-based solution reduces computational overhead while
significantly improving system throughput by 6.8% compared to existing RIS
element allocation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves better
performance while reducing computational complexity, making it significantly
more scalable than the iterative optimization algorithms.

Conclusion: FoMEMO为昂贵多目标优化提供了新的范式，通过合成数据预训练实现强大的跨问题泛化能力

Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in
many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited
evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing
works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for
each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past
domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to
generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the
real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO
(Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables
the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory
and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the
predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing
extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that
pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of
synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without
necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization
process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and
real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive
performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to
communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this
paper, is how to devise \textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}
techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a
novel calculus, called \textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation
transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \textit{source}
representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us
to generate a \textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of
structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source
representation and the generated target representation satisfy \textit{any}
specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting
\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can
express \textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair
of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure
for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We
formalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\cite{raggi2022rst},
building on the key concept of a \textit{construction space}. The abstract
nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of
diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as
well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a
system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative
representations in a wide range of practical settings.

TL;DR: HyPV-LEAD是一个用于加密货币异常交易检测的早期预警框架，通过窗口-视界建模、峰谷采样和双曲嵌入技术，在比特币交易数据上实现了0.9624的PR-AUC性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币异常交易（如混币服务、欺诈转账、拉盘砸盘）对金融完整性构成日益严重的风险，但由于类别不平衡、时间波动性和复杂网络依赖关系，检测异常交易非常困难。现有方法主要是模型中心化和事后检测，只能在异常发生后进行标记，预防价值有限。

Method: HyPV-LEAD框架集成了三个创新：(1)窗口-视界建模确保可操作的提前预警，(2)峰谷采样缓解类别不平衡同时保持时间连续性，(3)双曲嵌入捕捉区块链交易网络的层次结构和无标度特性。

Result: 在大规模比特币交易数据上的实证评估显示，HyPV-LEAD始终优于最先进的基线方法，实现了0.9624的PR-AUC，在精确率和召回率方面都有显著提升。消融研究证实每个组件都提供互补的收益。

Conclusion: 通过将异常检测从被动分类转变为主动预警，HyPV-LEAD为实时风险管理、反洗钱合规和动态区块链环境中的金融安全建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent
transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial
integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance,
temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are
predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they
occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces
HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a
data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into
anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three
innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time
alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while
preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the
hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.
Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that
HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a
PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation
studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic
embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits,
with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly
detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD
establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money
laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain
environments.

Conclusion: 为现实世界机器学习系统提供了更鲁棒、模块化和可解释的预处理流程，推动了数据插补技术的发展

Abstract: Missing data represents a fundamental challenge in machine learning
applications, often reducing model performance and reliability. This problem is
particularly acute in fields like bioinformatics and clinical machine learning,
where datasets are frequently incomplete due to the nature of both data
generation and data collection. While numerous imputation methods exist, from
simple statistical techniques to advanced deep learning models, no single
method consistently performs well across diverse datasets and missingness
mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel Meta-Imputation approach that learns to
combine the outputs of multiple base imputers to predict missing values more
accurately. By training the proposed method called Meta-Imputation Balanced
(MIB) on synthetically masked data with known ground truth, the system learns
to predict the most suitable imputed value based on the behavior of each
method. Our work highlights the potential of ensemble learning in imputation
and paves the way for more robust, modular, and interpretable preprocessing
pipelines in real-world machine learning systems.

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型自动发现新的交通信号控制算法，通过程序合成和进化搜索优化，在信号交叉口实验中比Webster基准减少20.1%的平均延迟和47.1%的平均停车次数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定时间交通信号控制依赖手工公式和人工调整，劳动密集且在异构或拥堵条件下效果不佳，需要自动化算法设计方法

Method: 将问题表述为程序合成，候选算法表示为具有固定输入输出结构的Python函数，通过外部评估（交通模拟器）和进化搜索进行迭代优化

Result: 在信号交叉口实验中，发现的算法优于Webster基准，平均延迟减少20.1%，平均停车次数减少47.1%

Conclusion: 这项工作通过利用AI进行交通信号控制算法设计，开辟了新的研究方向，将程序合成与交通工程相结合

Abstract: In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely
used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design
depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by
engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields
suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper
introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding
agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We
formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are
represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and
iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator)
and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate
that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average
delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and
incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting
cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green
allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers.
This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design
in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation
engineering.

TL;DR: 提出基于流匹配的生成框架，用于建模分岔现象中的多模态概率分布，通过等变建模保持系统对称性，在多种系统中验证了优于非概率和变分方法的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非线性动力系统中的分岔现象常导致多个共存稳定解，传统确定性机器学习模型难以捕捉这种多重性，会平均不同解且无法表示低对称性结果

Method: 基于流匹配的生成框架，引入对称匹配策略，在群作用下对齐预测和目标输出，通过等变建模保持系统对称性

Result: 在从玩具模型到复杂物理问题（如屈曲梁和Allen-Cahn方程）的一系列系统中验证，流匹配在捕捉多模态分布和对称破缺分岔方面显著优于非概率和变分方法

Conclusion: 为高维系统中的多稳态建模提供了原则性且可扩展的解决方案，能够直接采样多个有效解同时保持系统对称性

Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple
coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking.
Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity,
averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In
this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model
the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables
direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries
through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that
aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate
learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of
systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams
and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching
significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in
capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering
a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in
high-dimensional systems.

TL;DR: GANs在差分隐私训练下比扩散模型对成员推理攻击具有更强的隐私鲁棒性，模型类型本身显著影响隐私泄露程度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GANs和扩散模型都可以在差分隐私下训练来保护敏感数据，但它们对成员推理攻击的敏感性尚未得到充分理解，这是数据机密性的关键威胁

Method: 通过基于稳定性的理论分析和标准化的MIA流程进行实证研究，评估不同数据集和隐私预算下的隐私泄露情况

Result: 研究结果显示GANs对数据扰动的基本敏感性低于扩散模型，在强差分隐私机制下GANs始终表现出明显的隐私鲁棒性优势

Conclusion: 模型类型本身是影响隐私泄露的关键因素，GANs在抵抗成员推理攻击方面具有结构性优势

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have emerged as
leading approaches for high-quality image synthesis. While both can be trained
under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality,
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified
theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially
private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based
analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data
perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in
resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical
study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across
datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy
robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that
model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.

Conclusion: 生成式与预测式模型结合的方法有助于表位发现，仅使用氨基酸一级序列，无需几何框架或手工特征工程，有望实现更快、更经济的合成表位生成和筛选。

Abstract: Epitopes are short antigenic peptide sequences which are recognized by
antibodies or immune cell receptors. These are central to the development of
immunotherapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. However, the rational design of
synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial
sequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids,
making screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental
techniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,
pre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,
which for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,
which are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of
known epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of
epitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to
predict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus
narrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying
specific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and
predictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery. The approach uses
only primary amino acid sequences of linear epitopes, bypassing the need for a
geometric framework or hand-crafted features of the sequences. By developing a
method to create biologically feasible sequences, we anticipate faster and more
cost-effective generation and screening of synthetic epitopes, with relevant
applications in the development of new biotechnologies.

TL;DR: Fair-Synergy是一个开源算法框架，通过利用智能体准确性与系统资源之间的凹关系，在多智能体智能系统中实现公平资源分配，在推理和学习任务中分别比基准方法提升25%和11%的性能。


<details>

Abstract: Resource allocation is crucial for the performance optimization of
cloud-assisted multi-agent intelligence. Traditional methods often overlook
agents' diverse computational capabilities and complex operating environments,
leading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution. To address this, we
open-sourced Fair-Synergy, an algorithmic framework that utilizes the concave
relationship between the agents' accuracy and the system resources to ensure
fair resource allocation across fleet intelligence. We extend traditional
allocation approaches to encompass a multidimensional machine learning utility
landscape defined by model parameters, training data volume, and task
complexity. We evaluate Fair-Synergy with advanced vision and language models
such as BERT, VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNets on datasets including MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, BDD, and GLUE. We demonstrate that Fair-Synergy
outperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11%
in multi-agent learning settings. Also, we explore how the level of fairness
affects the least advantaged, most advantaged, and average agents, providing
insights for equitable fleet intelligence.

Motivation: 探索夏令时制对不同国家睡眠时长的影响，以及地理位置在这一关系中的调节作用

Method: 采用61个国家的睡眠数据，按DST实施情况分组，进行统计相关分析，并考虑维度因素的调节作用

Result: DST实施国家平均睡眠时长更长，但维度交互作用显著：低维度地区DST国家睡眠更短，高维度地区DST国家睡眠更长

Conclusion: 夏令时制对睡眠的影响受到地理位置的调节，维度是重要的调节因素

Abstract: In this study we analyzed average sleep durations across 61 countries to
examine the impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) practices. Key metrics
influencing sleep were identified, and statistical correlation analysis was
applied to explore relationships among these factors. Countries were grouped
based on DST observance, and visualizations compared sleep patterns between DST
and non-DST regions. Results show that, on average, countries observing DST
tend to report longer sleep durations than those that do not. A more detailed
pattern emerged when accounting for latitude: at lower latitudes, DST-observing
countries reported shorter sleep durations compared to non-DST countries, while
at higher latitudes, DST-observing countries reported longer average sleep
durations. These findings suggest that the influence of DST on sleep may be
moderated by geographical location.

TL;DR: 该论文将似然函数校准从二元假设扩展到多元假设，利用Aitchison几何和等距对数比变换，提出了多类情况下的校准定义、幂等性和分布约束，并应用于机器学习中的非线性判别分析。


<details>

Motivation: 传统校准研究主要关注概率预测，而似然函数校准（特别是在生物识别中）仅限于二元假设情况。本文旨在将校准概念扩展到多于两个假设的多元情况。

Method: 使用Aitchison几何和单纯形空间理论，将二元情况下的对数似然比(LLR)扩展到多元情况下的等距对数比变换似然函数，恢复了贝叶斯规则的向量形式。

Result: 成功将校准定义、幂等性性质和似然函数分布约束扩展到多元假设情况，提出了多类LLR的对应概念。

Conclusion: 这项工作主要是概念性的，但通过非线性判别分析的应用展示了校准似然函数可以提高方法的可解释性和可靠性，为多类似然函数校准提供了理论框架。

Abstract: While calibration of probabilistic predictions has been widely studied, this
paper rather addresses calibration of likelihood functions. This has been
discussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and
mutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be
written as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs
and its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the
idempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the
LLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been
limited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two
hypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to
recover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending
therefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.
Especially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the
constraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple
hypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio
transformed likelihood function. This work is mainly conceptual, but we still
provide one application to machine learning by presenting a non-linear
discriminant analysis where the discriminant components form a calibrated
likelihood function over the classes, improving therefore the interpretability
and the reliability of the method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: t-SNE和UMAP等降维方法在可视化聚类数据时虽然能很好分离簇群，但往往会扭曲数据的全局几何结构

Method: 采用三阶段方法：先对数据进行聚类，然后分别嵌入每个簇，最后对齐所有簇得到全局嵌入

Result: 在多个合成和真实数据集上验证，该方法与现有方法竞争力相当，但更加透明

Conclusion: 模块化的聚类-嵌入-对齐方法提供了一种更透明且能更好保持全局结构的降维可视化方案

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular methods
for visualizing data with a potential (latent) clustered structure. They are
known to group data points at the same time as they embed them, resulting in
visualizations with well-separated clusters that preserve local information
well. However, t-SNE and UMAP also tend to distort the global geometry of the
underlying data. We propose a more transparent, modular approach consisting of
first clustering the data, then embedding each cluster, and finally aligning
the clusters to obtain a global embedding. We demonstrate this approach on
several synthetic and real-world datasets and show that it is competitive with
existing methods, while being much more transparent.

Conclusion: 图神经网络为医疗决策支持提供了有前景的新途径，但表示学习在医疗领域的复杂性仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition. When treating sepsis, it is
challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and
vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising
results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity
of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more
natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the
well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time.
Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and
GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of
decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are
trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that
predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy
learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation
confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the
complexity of representation learning in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR中的结果奖励模型(ORM)过于粗粒度，无法区分正确答案中的错误推理或错误答案中的正确推理，而过程奖励模型(PRM)虽然提供细粒度指导但存在不准确性和奖励攻击问题

Method: 提出PROF方法，通过一致性驱动的样本选择来协调PRM和ORM的互补优势，保留具有较高平均过程值的正确响应和较低平均过程值的错误响应，同时保持正负训练样本平衡

Result: 实验表明该方法相比混合方法持续提高最终准确率超过4%，同时增强了中间推理步骤的质量

Conclusion: PROF通过有效的数据处理策略解决了RLVR中奖励模型的粒度不匹配问题，在数学推理任务中取得了显著改进

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged to be a
predominant paradigm for mathematical reasoning tasks, offering stable
improvements in reasoning ability. However, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in
RLVR are too coarse-grained to distinguish flawed reasoning within correct
answers or valid reasoning within incorrect answers. This lack of granularity
introduces noisy and misleading gradients significantly and hinders further
progress in reasoning process quality. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer
fine-grained guidance for intermediate steps, they frequently suffer from
inaccuracies and are susceptible to reward hacking.
  To resolve this dilemma, we introduce PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF), an
effective data process curation method that harmonizes noisy, fine-grained
process rewards with accurate, coarse-grained outcome rewards. Rather than
naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function
(arXiv:archive/2506.18896), PROF leverages their complementary strengths
through consistency-driven sample selection. Our approach retains correct
responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with
lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training
sample balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only
consistently improves the final accuracy over $4\%$ compared to the blending
approaches, but also strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

Conclusion: 本文为KANs提供了有效的初始化策略，特别是幂律初始化方法在各种任务中表现最优，有助于提升KANs的训练效果和性能。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a recently introduced neural
architecture that replace fixed nonlinearities with trainable activation
functions, offering enhanced flexibility and interpretability. While KANs have
been applied successfully across scientific and machine learning tasks, their
initialization strategies remain largely unexplored. In this work, we study
initialization schemes for spline-based KANs, proposing two theory-driven
approaches inspired by LeCun and Glorot, as well as an empirical power-law
family with tunable exponents. Our evaluation combines large-scale grid
searches on function fitting and forward PDE benchmarks, an analysis of
training dynamics through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel, and
evaluations on a subset of the Feynman dataset. Our findings indicate that the
Glorot-inspired initialization significantly outperforms the baseline in
parameter-rich models, while power-law initialization achieves the strongest
performance overall, both across tasks and for architectures of varying size.

TL;DR: LINKER是首个基于序列的模型，仅使用蛋白质序列和配体SMILES就能预测残基-功能基团相互作用类型，无需3D结构输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法的局限性：需要3D结构输入或基于距离的接触标签，限制了应用范围和生物学相关性。需要开发仅基于序列就能准确预测生物相关相互作用的方法。

Method: 使用结构监督的注意力机制训练，通过功能基团基序提取从3D蛋白-配体复合物获得相互作用标签。将配体结构抽象为功能基团，关注化学有意义的子结构。

Result: 在LP-PDBBind基准测试中，基于功能基团抽象的结构监督产生了与真实生化注释高度一致的相互作用预测。

Conclusion: LINKER仅需序列级输入即可进行大规模应用，在缺乏结构数据的场景中具有重要价值，能够准确预测生物定义的相互作用类型。

Abstract: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand
functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide
rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand
interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based
contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We
introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional
group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using
only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with
structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D
protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By
abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on
chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather
than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level
input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where
structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark
demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group
abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth
biochemical annotations.

Conclusion: 该GNN框架为液体与动态空间体的复杂交互提供了有效的模拟方案，具有良好的泛化性和应用潜力。

Abstract: Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving
real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics,
and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on
graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems.
However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in
static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving
primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically
moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed
from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body
interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph
nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations
with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the
network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate
surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic
settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments.
Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our
model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel
manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the
learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using
gradient-based optimization methods.

TL;DR: 本文证明了Tuning without Forgetting (TwF)方法在非奇异控制下形成的参数子空间是一个有限余维的Banach子流形，并刻画了其切空间，为TwF在顺序训练中保持映射不变性提供了精确的理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为先前提出的TwF方法（顺序训练神经ODE时保持先前学习样本端点映射不变）提供严格的理论基础，超越一阶近似的局限性。

Method: 通过数学分析证明在非奇异控制下，TwF的参数子空间构成有限余维的Banach子流形，并精确刻画其切空间结构。

Result: 证明了TwF对应的参数子空间确实是Banach子流形，其切空间特征表明TwF方法能够沿着该子流形的切空间进行控制函数的连续变形，从而精确保持映射不变性。

Conclusion: 该研究为TwF方法提供了坚实的数学理论基础，表明该方法能够在顺序训练过程中精确保持先前学习样本的映射关系，而不仅仅是一阶近似意义上的保持。

Abstract: In our earlier work, we introduced the principle of Tuning without Forgetting
(TwF) for sequential training of neural ODEs, where training samples are added
iteratively and parameters are updated within the subspace of control functions
that preserves the end-point mapping at previously learned samples on the
manifold of output labels in the first-order approximation sense. In this
letter, we prove that this parameter subspace forms a Banach submanifold of
finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and we characterize its tangent
space. This reveals that TwF corresponds to a continuation/deformation of the
control function along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, providing
a theoretical foundation for its mapping-preserving (not forgetting) during the

### [95] [Robult: Leveraging Redundancy and Modality Specific Features for Robust Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03477)
*Duy A. Nguyen,Abhi Kamboj,Minh N. Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Robult是一个可扩展的多模态学习框架，通过信息论方法解决模态缺失和标注数据有限的问题，采用PU对比损失和潜在重构损失来保持模态特异性信息并利用冗余性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中模态缺失和有限标注数据的关键挑战，提升模型的鲁棒性和实用性。

Method: 提出软正未标注(PU)对比损失最大化任务相关特征对齐，以及潜在重构损失确保模态特异性信息保留，采用模块化设计。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Robult在半监督学习和缺失模态场景下均优于现有方法，具有优异的性能表现。

Conclusion: Robult框架通过轻量级设计实现了可扩展性，能够无缝集成到现有架构中，适用于实际多模态应用场景。

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for
advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework
designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific
information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic
approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while
effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)
a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information
is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance
performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete
modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets
validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in
both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its
lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing
architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

TL;DR: SafeProtein是首个针对蛋白质基础模型的红队测试框架，通过多模态提示工程和启发式束搜索方法，成功对现有蛋白质模型进行持续越狱攻击（最高70%成功率），揭示了潜在生物安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质基础模型缺乏系统性红队测试，存在被滥用于生成具有生物安全风险蛋白质的严重隐患，需要建立安全评估框架。

Method: 结合多模态提示工程和启发式束搜索方法，构建SafeProtein-Bench基准数据集和评估协议，系统设计红队测试方法。

Conclusion: SafeProtein框架有效暴露了蛋白质基础模型的生物安全风险，为前沿模型的安全防护技术发展提供了重要见解，代码将开源供社区使用。

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The
advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein
foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding
and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has
raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating
proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the
first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best
of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and
heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct
tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which
includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a
comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks
on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate
for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein
foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security
protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/jigang-fan/SafeProtein.

*Han Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AEnt是一种针对LLM-RL训练的新颖熵控制方法，通过钳制熵奖励和自动调整系数来解决传统熵正则化在大语言模型强化学习中的失效问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统熵正则化方法在机器人控制和游戏RL中有效，但在LLM-RL训练中效果不佳，主要因为LLM响应空间极大且最优输出稀疏

Method: 提出AEnt方法：使用钳制熵奖励（在更小的标记空间上重新归一化策略计算）和自动调整的熵系数，鼓励在紧凑响应集中探索

Result: 在数学推理任务中，AEnt在不同基础模型和数据集上均优于基线方法，在多个基准测试中表现一致优秀

Conclusion: AEnt通过创新的熵控制机制有效解决了LLM-RL训练中的熵正则化问题，为大规模语言模型的强化学习提供了更有效的探索策略

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their
effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy
regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including
PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic
and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in
LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL
setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy
regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the
sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy
control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically
adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized
policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration
within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically
adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively
controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.
AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and
datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently
across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究构建了全球作物类型数据集CropGlobe，开发了轻量级CNN模型CropNet，通过时序数据增强技术提升跨区域作物分类的泛化能力，发现Sentinel-2的2D中值时序特征具有最强的地理不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球尺度作物类型识别对粮食安全至关重要，但现有方法在地理迁移时性能下降严重，需要寻找对地理变化不变的特征表示来提升跨区域泛化能力。

Method: 构建包含30万个样本的全球作物数据集CropGlobe；比较Sentinel-2时序多光谱特征和EMIT高光谱特征的迁移性；设计轻量CNN模型CropNet，结合时间偏移、时间尺度和幅度扭曲等时序数据增强技术。

Result: Sentinel-2的2D中值时序特征在所有迁移场景中表现出最强的地理不变性；数据增强技术显著提升了模型鲁棒性，特别是在训练数据多样性有限时效果更明显。

Conclusion: 研究发现了更具不变性的特征表示，增强了地理可迁移性，为在全球多样化区域实现可扩展、低成本的作物类型应用提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Accurately obtaining crop type and its spatial distribution at a global scale
is critical for food security, agricultural policy-making, and sustainable
development. Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop
classification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many
regions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address
performance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote
sensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes
strategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a
global crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries
across five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,
soybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,
CropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,
and cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal
multi-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic
coefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization
under spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and
robust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal
data augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that
simulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median
temporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance
across all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,
particularly when training data diversity is limited. Overall, the work
identifies more invariant feature representations that enhance geographic
transferability and suggests a promising path toward scalable, low-cost crop
type applications across globally diverse regions.

TL;DR: ZOWarmUp是一种联邦学习的零阶优化算法，允许内存和通信受限的边缘设备参与模型训练，通过方差减少技术实现从随机初始化开始的高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中，由于内存和通信限制，许多边缘设备无法参与训练，导致数据不可访问和系统偏差增加。需要一种方法让低资源设备也能参与训练，提高数据多样性和训练效果。

Method: 基于MeZO零阶优化方法，设计了ZOWarmUp算法，利用不同客户端能力和方差减少技术，仅需传输少量随机种子而非完整梯度，显著降低通信成本。

Result: 实验表明ZOWarmUp在各种数据集和模型架构下都具有鲁棒性，能够有效利用低资源设备的数据，提高训练结果的多样性和质量。

Conclusion: ZOWarmUp为高比例低资源边缘设备的系统提供了有效的训练解决方案，能够访问更多样化的数据，改善联邦学习训练效果。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across numerous edge
devices without requiring participants to share data; however, memory and
communication constraints on these edge devices may preclude their
participation in training. We consider a setting in which a subset of edge
devices are below a critical memory or communication threshold required to
conduct model updates. Under typical federated optimization algorithms, these
devices are excluded from training which renders their data inaccessible and
increases system induced bias. We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method
used for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to
zeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order
optimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to
correct. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,
ZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.
ZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction
techniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource
clients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp
eliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the
server and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the
up-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various
datasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm
that can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with
a high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from
training, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of
data, thus improving training outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现通用智能需要结合语言、物理世界和结构化数据的基础模型，当前缺乏专门处理结构化数据的统一模型

Method: 使用掩码联合分布建模和情景条件目标进行预训练，将结构化数据视为变量和缺失值的联合分布，支持基于查询的条件预测

Conclusion: LimiX展示了单一模型处理多样化表格任务的可行性，为结构化数据基础模型的发展奠定了基础

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary
foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured
data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large
structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint
distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide
range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single
model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an
episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query
subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,
training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large
structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature
dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,
missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified
interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including
gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation
models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,
regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial
margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per
task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications
raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional
falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM
knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains
underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior
of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical
scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the
neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal
interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control
deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce
behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying
tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task
performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal
optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics,
shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in
high-stakes environments. Code and more illustrations are available at

TL;DR: 比较两种机器人远程操作界面：耦合式（整合手臂操作和底座导航）与解耦式（分开控制），以及VR和屏幕两种视觉反馈方式。VR反馈增加任务时间和认知负荷，耦合式操作在用户负荷相当的情况下可能获得更好的模仿学习数据。

Motivation: 为移动操作机器人开发直观的远程操作界面，确保高质量数据收集同时降低操作员工作负荷，特别是在需要全身协调的复杂长时程任务中。

Method: 系统评估两种控制范式（耦合式和解耦式）和两种视觉反馈机制（VR和屏幕显示），在复杂多阶段任务序列中进行测试。

Result: VR反馈增加了任务完成时间、认知负荷和感知努力；耦合式操作与解耦式操作在用户负荷方面相当，但初步实验显示耦合式远程操作获得的数据能带来更好的模仿学习性能。

Conclusion: 研究为收集高质量、高维度移动操作数据提供了有价值的见解，强调了以人为中心的远程操作界面设计的重要性。

Abstract: Intuitive Teleoperation interfaces are essential for mobile manipulation
robots to ensure high quality data collection while reducing operator workload.
A strong sense of embodiment combined with minimal physical and cognitive
demands not only enhances the user experience during large-scale data
collection, but also helps maintain data quality over extended periods. This
becomes especially crucial for challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation
tasks that require whole-body coordination. We compare two distinct robot
control paradigms: a coupled embodiment integrating arm manipulation and base
navigation functions, and a decoupled embodiment treating these systems as
separate control entities. Additionally, we evaluate two visual feedback
mechanisms: immersive virtual reality and conventional screen-based
visualization of the robot's field of view. These configurations were
systematically assessed across a complex, multi-stage task sequence requiring
integrated planning and execution. Our results show that the use of VR as a
feedback modality increases task completion time, cognitive workload, and
perceived effort of the teleoperator. Coupling manipulation and navigation
leads to a comparable workload on the user as decoupling the embodiments, while
preliminary experiments suggest that data acquired by coupled teleoperation
leads to better imitation learning performance. Our holistic view on intuitive
teleoperation interfaces provides valuable insight into collecting
high-quality, high-dimensional mobile manipulation data at scale with the human
operator in mind. Project

TL;DR: WOMD数据集在行为分析中存在局限性，与真实AV操作数据相比，无法准确捕捉实际驾驶行为的动态性和交互性，特别是在短车距和急减速方面表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Waymo开放运动数据集(WOMD)是否准确反映真实自动驾驶车辆的行为动态和交互，因为该数据集存在专有后处理、缺乏误差量化以及轨迹分段等问题。

Method: 使用凤凰城独立收集的L4级AV自然驾驶数据(PHX)进行对比分析，涵盖三种典型城市驾驶场景：信号灯路口排队、跟车和变道行为。采用人工提取车头时距、SIMEX方法处理测量误差、DTW距离量化行为差异。

Result: 所有场景分析一致显示，PHX数据的行为超出了WOMD的行为范围，WOMD明显低估了短车距和急减速行为。

Conclusion: 仅基于WOMD校准的行为模型可能系统性低估自然驾驶的变异性、风险和复杂性，使用WOMD进行行为建模时需要谨慎并进行独立数据验证。

Abstract: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for
data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its
validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary
post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of
trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately
captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.
Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV
operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across
three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized
intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging
analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure
negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we
apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically
estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to
quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show
that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,
WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings
suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically
underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.
Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without
proper validation against independently collected data.

Abstract: We introduce Lattice Annotated Temporal (LAT) Logic, an extension of
Generalized Annotated Logic Programs (GAPs) that incorporates temporal
reasoning and supports open-world semantics through the use of a lower lattice
structure. This logic combines an efficient deduction process with temporal
logic programming to support non-Markovian relationships and open-world
reasoning capabilities. The open-world aspect, a by-product of the use of the
lower-lattice annotation structure, allows for efficient grounding through a
Skolemization process, even in domains with infinite or highly diverse
constants.
  We provide a suite of theoretical results that bound the computational
complexity of the grounding process, in addition to showing that many of the
results on GAPs (using an upper lattice) still hold with the lower lattice and
temporal extensions (though different proof techniques are required). Our
open-source implementation, PyReason, features modular design, machine-level
optimizations, and direct integration with reinforcement learning environments.
Empirical evaluations across multi-agent simulations and knowledge graph tasks
demonstrate up to three orders of magnitude speedup and up to five orders of
magnitude memory reduction while maintaining or improving task performance.
Additionally, we evaluate LAT Logic's value in reinforcement learning
environments as a non-Markovian simulator, achieving up to three orders of
magnitude faster simulation with improved agent performance, including a 26%
increase in win rate due to capturing richer temporal dependencies. These
results highlight LAT Logic's potential as a unified, extensible framework for
open-world temporal reasoning in dynamic and uncertain environments. Our

TL;DR: TraceLLM是一个利用LLM整合执行轨迹分析和反编译合约代码的框架，用于以太坊智能合约安全分析，能够自动识别攻击路径并生成安全报告，准确率比现有基线方法高25.93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有以太坊安全分析方法存在局限性：异常交易检测无法深入分析执行轨迹中的具体攻击策略，代码漏洞检测无法分析未验证合约且难以展示实际攻击利用方式。分析师仍需手动对齐交易轨迹和合约代码来重建攻击场景。

Method: 提出TraceLLM框架，结合LLM整合执行轨迹级检测和反编译合约代码。引入新的异常执行路径识别算法和LLM优化的反编译工具，识别易受攻击函数并为LLM提供明确的攻击路径。

Result: 在27个有专家报告的真实案例中，TraceLLM识别攻击者和受害者地址的精确度达85.19%，自动化报告的事实精确度为70.37%，比最佳基线准确率高25.93%。在148个真实以太坊事件中，自动化报告的专家验证准确率达66.22%。

Conclusion: TraceLLM建立了首个联合轨迹和合约代码驱动的安全分析基准，展示了强大的泛化能力，能够自动生成高质量的安全分析报告，显著提升以太坊智能合约安全分析的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Ethereum smart contracts hold tens of billions of USD in DeFi and NFTs, yet
comprehensive security analysis remains difficult due to unverified code,
proxy-based architectures, and the reliance on manual inspection of complex
execution traces. Existing approaches fall into two main categories: anomaly
transaction detection, which flags suspicious transactions but offers limited
insight into specific attack strategies hidden in execution traces inside
transactions, and code vulnerability detection, which cannot analyze unverified
contracts and struggles to show how identified flaws are exploited in real
incidents. As a result, analysts must still manually align transaction traces
with contract code to reconstruct attack scenarios and conduct forensics. To
address this gap, TraceLLM is proposed as a framework that leverages LLMs to
integrate execution trace-level detection with decompiled contract code. We
introduce a new anomaly execution path identification algorithm and an
LLM-refined decompile tool to identify vulnerable functions and provide
explicit attack paths to LLM. TraceLLM establishes the first benchmark for
joint trace and contract code-driven security analysis. For comparison, proxy
baselines are created by jointly transmitting the results of three
representative code analysis along with raw traces to LLM. TraceLLM identifies
attacker and victim addresses with 85.19\% precision and produces automated
reports with 70.37\% factual precision across 27 cases with ground truth expert
reports, achieving 25.93\% higher accuracy than the best baseline. Moreover,
across 148 real-world Ethereum incidents, TraceLLM automatically generates
reports with 66.22\% expert-verified accuracy, demonstrating strong
generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出了Add-remove Heterogeneous Differential Privacy (AHDP)框架，解决了传统HDP在用户数据与隐私需求相关时的不足，提供了对数据-隐私相关性的鲁棒性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异构差分隐私(HDP)框架假设用户数据和隐私级别不相关，但在实际应用中这种相关性普遍存在，导致标准HDP框架失效。

Method: 提出AHDP框架，通过假设检验形式化隐私保证，设计了不需要先验知识数据-隐私相关性的机制，应用于均值估计、频率估计和线性回归等核心统计任务。

Result: AHDP框架能够有效处理数据与隐私需求的相关性，提出的机制实现简单、假设最少，适合实际应用，并通过LLM生成的合成数据集进行了实证评估。

Conclusion: AHDP框架为解决数据与隐私需求相关性提供了有效的解决方案，所提机制具有实际应用价值，为未来隐私保护研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Previous works in the differential privacy literature that allow users to
choose their privacy levels typically operate under the heterogeneous
differential privacy (HDP) framework with the simplifying assumption that user
data and privacy levels are not correlated. Firstly, we demonstrate that the
standard HDP framework falls short when user data and privacy demands are
allowed to be correlated. Secondly, to address this shortcoming, we propose an
alternate framework, Add-remove Heterogeneous Differential Privacy (AHDP), that
jointly accounts for user data and privacy preference. We show that AHDP is
robust to possible correlations between data and privacy. Thirdly, we formalize
the guarantees of the proposed AHDP framework through an operational hypothesis
testing perspective. The hypothesis testing setup may be of independent
interest in analyzing other privacy frameworks as well. Fourthly, we show that
there exists non-trivial AHDP mechanisms that notably do not require prior
knowledge of the data-privacy correlations. We propose some such mechanisms and
apply them to core statistical tasks such as mean estimation, frequency
estimation, and linear regression. The proposed mechanisms are simple to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统依赖敏感数据引发隐私担忧，全同态加密可保护隐私但处理大型稀疏用户-物品评分矩阵效率低下，通信开销也是关键问题

Method: 将压缩稀疏行表示与基于全同态加密的矩阵分解相结合，在加密域中高效处理矩阵稀疏性

Result: 实验结果显示在加密数据上实现高推荐精度的同时达到最低通信成本

Conclusion: 该方法有效保护用户隐私，解决了加密推荐系统中稀疏矩阵处理和通信开销的关键挑战

Abstract: In today's data-driven world, recommendation systems personalize user
experiences across industries but rely on sensitive data, raising privacy
concerns. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) can secure these systems, but a
significant challenge in applying FHE to recommendation systems is efficiently
handling the inherently large and sparse user-item rating matrices. FHE
operations are computationally intensive, and naively processing various sparse
matrices in recommendation systems would be prohibitively expensive.
Additionally, the communication overhead between parties remains a critical
concern in encrypted domains. We propose a novel approach combining Compressed
Sparse Row (CSR) representation with FHE-based matrix factorization that
efficiently handles matrix sparsity in the encrypted domain while minimizing
communication costs. Our experimental results demonstrate high recommendation
accuracy with encrypted data while achieving the lowest communication costs,
effectively preserving user privacy.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的感叹词分类任务，并创建了专门的感叹词数据集，通过深度学习模型和数据增帽技术提高了分类准确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人机交互中，感叹词如"mmm"和"hmm"常用于表达同意、犹豫或请求信息，但被ASR引擎忽视为"非词语"，需要解决这个问题。

Method: 收集专门的感叹词数据集，训练基线深度学习模型，使用节奏和音高变换等数据增帽技术提高性能。

Result: 数据增帽技术显著提高了分类准确度，使模型更加稳健。数据集、Python库、基线模型和评估脚本已开源。

Conclusion: 该研究先驱性地解决了感叹词分类的挑战，为改善人机对话的自然性提供了重要技术支持。

Abstract: In the realm of human-computer interaction, fostering a natural dialogue
between humans and machines is paramount. A key, often overlooked, component of
this dialogue is the use of interjections such as "mmm" and "hmm". Despite
their frequent use to express agreement, hesitation, or requests for
information, these interjections are typically dismissed as "non-words" by
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engines. Addressing this gap, we introduce a
novel task dedicated to interjection classification, a pioneer in the field to
our knowledge. This task is challenging due to the short duration of
interjection signals and significant inter- and intra-speaker variability. In
this work, we present and publish a dataset of interjection signals collected
specifically for interjection classification. We employ this dataset to train
and evaluate a baseline deep learning model. To enhance performance, we augment
the training dataset using techniques such as tempo and pitch transformation,
which significantly improve classification accuracy, making models more robust.
The interjection dataset, a Python library for the augmentation pipeline,
baseline model, and evaluation scripts, are available to the research
community.

TL;DR: 提出基于零膨胀泊松(ZIP)框架的驾驶风险评估模型，通过EM算法学习潜在行为群体，解决周度近失事件数据的稀疏性和异质性问题，在保险定价中实现更准确的周度风险预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计模型在处理稀疏、零膨胀且行为异质的周度近失事件数据时存在欠拟合问题，需要开发能够识别不同驾驶风格并提供校准风险预测的方法。

Method: 使用零膨胀泊松(ZIP)框架，通过EM算法学习潜在行为群体，拟合基于偏移量的计数模型，对354名商业驾驶员一年的多传感器遥测数据进行分析。

Result: 模型在样本内具有更低的AIC/BIC值，样本外校准效果更好，相比基线方法和现有遥测模型有持续改进，对聚类数量的敏感性分析显示结果稳健可解释。

Conclusion: 该方法支持基于周度的情境感知费率制定，通过识别异质驾驶风格实现更公平的保费定价，为基于使用的保险(UBI)提供了有效的风险评估工具。

Abstract: Driving behavior big data leverages multi-sensor telematics to understand how
people drive and powers applications such as risk evaluation, insurance
pricing, and targeted intervention. Usage-based insurance (UBI) built on these
data has become mainstream. Telematics-captured near-miss events (NMEs) provide
a timely alternative to claim-based risk, but weekly NMEs are sparse, highly
zero-inflated, and behaviorally heterogeneous even after exposure
normalization. Analyzing multi-sensor telematics and ADAS warnings, we show
that the traditional statistical models underfit the dataset. We address these
challenges by proposing a set of zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) frameworks that
learn latent behavior groups and fit offset-based count models via EM to yield
calibrated, interpretable weekly risk predictions. Using a naturalistic dataset
from a fleet of 354 commercial drivers over a year, during which the drivers
completed 287,511 trips and logged 8,142,896 km in total, our results show
consistent improvements over baselines and prior telematics models, with lower
AIC/BIC values in-sample and better calibration out-of-sample. We also
conducted sensitivity analyses on the EM-based grouping for the number of
clusters, finding that the gains were robust and interpretable. Practically,
this supports context-aware ratemaking on a weekly basis and fairer premiums by
recognizing heterogeneous driving styles.

Motivation: 研究美国精神分裂症的种族和性别差异，探索医生偏见是否是导致这些差异的关键因素，特别是在压力较大的急诊环境中。

Method: 分析纳米山健康系统的急诊精神科患者数据，通过计算患者首次急诊记录中负面句子的比例来量化医生偏见，使用逻辑回归模型控制风险因素后分析偏见对精神分裂症诊断的影响。

Result: 负面语言比例增加与精神分裂症诊断概率显著相关（OR=1.408）；黑人和男性更容易被诊断；高社会经济地位的黑人女性患者诊断概率最高（OR=1.629），显示社会经济地位并非保护因素。

Conclusion: 医生偏见在真实世界数据中可被量化且与污名化诊断的增加相关，强调了需要更多关注健康差异的量化和交叉性影响。

Abstract: In the United States, schizophrenia (SCZ) carries a race and sex disparity
that may be explained by clinician bias - a belief held by a clinician about a
patient that prevents impartial clinical decision making. The emergency
department (ED) is marked by higher rates of stress that lead to clinicians
relying more on implicit biases during decision making. In this work, we
considered a large cohort of psychiatric patients in the ED from the Mount
Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York City to investigate the effects of
clinician bias on SCZ diagnosis while controlling for known risk factors and
patient sociodemographic information. Clinician bias was quantified as the
ratio of negative to total sentences within a patient's first ED note. We
utilized a logistic regression to predict SCZ diagnosis given patient race,
sex, age, history of trauma or substance use disorder, and the ratio of
negative sentences. Our findings showed that an increased ratio of negative
sentences is associated with higher odds of obtaining a SCZ diagnosis [OR (95%
CI)=1.408 (1.361-1.456)]. Identifying as male [OR (95% CI)=1.112 (1.055-1.173)]
or Black [OR (95% CI)=1.081(1.031-1.133)] increased one's odds of being
diagnosed with SCZ. However, from an intersectional lens, Black female patients
with high SES have the highest odds of obtaining a SCZ diagnosis [OR (95%
CI)=1.629 (1.535-1.729)]. Results such as these suggest that SES does not act
as a protective buffer against SCZ diagnosis in all patients, demanding more
attention to the quantification of health disparities. Lastly, we demonstrated
that clinician bias is operational with real world data and related to
increased odds of obtaining a stigmatizing diagnosis such as SCZ.

Motivation: 基于代理的模型(ABMs)在模拟复杂系统时面临计算压力大、参数检定困难的挑战，限制了其广泛应用

Method: 将自动微分(AD)技术应用于ABMs，获取模拟器的梯度信息，并采用变分推断(VI)技术进行高效参数检定

Result: 在三个重要ABMs(Axtell公司模型、Sugarscape、SIR传染病模型)上实验，显示了显著的性能提升和计算节省

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了ABMs在复杂系统研究中的实用性和可扩展性

Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate complex systems by capturing the bottom-up
interactions of individual agents comprising the system. Many complex systems
of interest, such as epidemics or financial markets, involve thousands or even
millions of agents. Consequently, ABMs often become computationally demanding
and rely on the calibration of numerous free parameters, which has
significantly hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we demonstrate
that automatic differentiation (AD) techniques can effectively alleviate these
computational burdens. By applying AD to ABMs, the gradients of the simulator
become readily available, greatly facilitating essential tasks such as
calibration and sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show how AD enables
variational inference (VI) techniques for efficient parameter calibration. Our
experiments demonstrate substantial performance improvements and computational
savings using VI on three prominent ABMs: Axtell's model of firms; Sugarscape;
and the SIR epidemiological model. Our approach thus significantly enhances the
practicality and scalability of ABMs for studying complex systems.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of mortality, underscoring the
critical importance of precise diagnosis through X-ray angiography. Manual
coronary artery segmentation from these images is time-consuming and
inefficient, prompting the development of automated models. However, existing
methods, whether rule-based or deep learning models, struggle with issues like
poor performance and limited generalizability. Moreover, current knowledge
distillation methods applied in this field have not fully exploited the
hierarchical knowledge of the model, leading to certain information waste and
insufficient enhancement of the model's performance capabilities for
segmentation tasks. To address these issues, this paper introduces Deep
Self-knowledge Distillation, a novel approach for coronary artery segmentation
that leverages hierarchical outputs for supervision. By combining Deep
Distribution Loss and Pixel-wise Self-knowledge Distillation Loss, our method
enhances the student model's segmentation performance through a hierarchical
learning strategy, effectively transferring knowledge from the teacher model.
Our method combines a loosely constrained probabilistic distribution vector
with tightly constrained pixel-wise supervision, providing dual regularization
for the segmentation model while also enhancing its generalization and
robustness. Extensive experiments on XCAD and DCA1 datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms the dice coefficient, accuracy, sensitivity and IoU
compared to other models in comparative evaluations.

Motivation: 现有方法主要基于静态结构，如何利用原子分子动力学模拟开发更通用的模型以提高新分子结构的预测准确性是一个开放性问题。

Method: 提出SurGBSA方法，在CASF-2016基准测试的140万个3D轨迹上训练MMGBSA的替代函数，采用物理信息预训练策略。

Result: 相比传统单点MMGBSA计算，SurGBSA实现了6497倍的速度提升，在姿态排序问题上准确率差异仅为-0.4%。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过证明在MD模拟上训练可以改进模型，推动了分子基础模型的发展，相关模型、代码和训练数据已公开。

Abstract: Self-supervised pretraining from static structures of drug-like compounds and
proteins enable powerful learned feature representations. Learned features
demonstrate state of the art performance on a range of predictive tasks
including molecular properties, structure generation, and protein-ligand
interactions. The majority of approaches are limited by their use of static
structures and it remains an open question, how best to use atomistic molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations to develop more generalized models to improve
prediction accuracy for novel molecular structures. We present SURrogate mmGBSA
(SurGBSA) as a new modeling approach for MD-based representation learning,
which learns a surrogate function of the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born
Surface Area (MMGBSA). We show for the first time the benefits of
physics-informed pre-training to train a surrogate MMGBSA model on a collection
of over 1.4 million 3D trajectories collected from MD simulations of the
CASF-2016 benchmark. SurGBSA demonstrates a dramatic 6,497x speedup versus a
traditional physics-based single-point MMGBSA calculation while nearly matching
single-point MMGBSA accuracy on the challenging pose ranking problem for
identification of the correct top pose (-0.4% difference). Our work advances
the development of molecular foundation models by showing model improvements
when training on MD simulations. Models, code and training data are made

TL;DR: EEG-MSAF是一个端到端的EEG微状态分析框架，通过机器学习分类和SHAP特征排名，在痴呆症早期诊断中达到89-95%的准确率，超越了深度学习基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 痴呆症是全球性健康挑战，需要早期准确诊断。传统EEG方法难以捕捉脑电活动的瞬时复杂性，因此需要开发新的分析框架来识别痴呆相关的生物标志物。

Method: EEG-MSAF包含三个阶段：1）自动化微状态特征提取；2）机器学习分类；3）使用SHAP进行特征排名以识别关键生物标志物。在两个EEG数据集（CAUEEG和Thessaloniki临床队列）上进行评估。

Result: 在CAUEEG数据集上达到89%±0.01准确率，超越CEEDNET基线19.3%；在Thessaloniki数据集上达到95%±0.01准确率，与EEGConvNeXt相当。SHAP分析发现平均相关性和出现频率是最具信息量的指标。

Conclusion: EEG-MSAF通过结合准确性、泛化性和可解释性，推进了基于EEG的痴呆症诊断，并揭示了跨认知谱系的大脑动态变化，微状态C和新型微状态F被确定为关键生物标志物。

Abstract: Dementia (DEM) is a growing global health challenge, underscoring the need
for early and accurate diagnosis. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a
non-invasive window into brain activity, but conventional methods struggle to
capture its transient complexity. We present the \textbf{EEG Microstate
Analysis Framework (EEG-MSAF)}, an end-to-end pipeline that leverages EEG
microstates discrete, quasi-stable topographies to identify DEM-related
biomarkers and distinguish DEM, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal
cognition (NC). EEG-MSAF comprises three stages: (1) automated microstate
feature extraction, (2) classification with machine learning (ML), and (3)
feature ranking using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to highlight key
biomarkers. We evaluate on two EEG datasets: the public Chung-Ang University
EEG (CAUEEG) dataset and a clinical cohort from Thessaloniki Hospital. Our
framework demonstrates strong performance and generalizability. On CAUEEG,
EEG-MSAF-SVM achieves \textbf{89\% $\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, surpassing the deep
learning baseline CEEDNET by \textbf{19.3\%}. On the Thessaloniki dataset, it
reaches \textbf{95\% $\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, comparable to EEGConvNeXt. SHAP
analysis identifies mean correlation and occurrence as the most informative
metrics: disruption of microstate C (salience/attention network) dominates DEM
prediction, while microstate F, a novel default-mode pattern, emerges as a key
early biomarker for both MCI and DEM. By combining accuracy, generalizability,
and interpretability, EEG-MSAF advances EEG-based dementia diagnosis and sheds
light on brain dynamics across the cognitive spectrum.

Abstract: As one of the most effective methods for cardiovascular disease (CVD)
diagnosis, multi-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals present a characteristic
multi-sensor information fusion challenge that has been continuously researched
in deep learning domains. Despite the numerous algorithms proposed with
different DL architectures, maintaining a balance among performance,
computational complexity, and multi-source ECG feature fusion remains
challenging. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various fields. Their inherent
design for high-efficiency computation and linear complexity makes them
particularly suitable for low-dimensional data like ECGs. This work proposes
S2M2ECG, an SSM architecture featuring three-level fusion mechanisms: (1)
Spatio-temporal bi-directional SSMs with segment tokenization for low-level
signal fusion, (2) Intra-lead temporal information fusion with bi-directional
scanning to enhance recognition accuracy in both forward and backward
directions, (3) Cross-lead feature interaction modules for spatial information
fusion. To fully leverage the ECG-specific multi-lead mechanisms inherent in
ECG signals, a multi-branch design and lead fusion modules are incorporated,
enabling individual analysis of each lead while ensuring seamless integration
with others. Experimental results reveal that S2M2ECG achieves superior
performance in the rhythmic, morphological, and clinical scenarios. Moreover,
its lightweight architecture ensures it has nearly the fewest parameters among
existing models, making it highly suitable for efficient inference and
convenient deployment. Collectively, S2M2ECG offers a promising alternative
that strikes an excellent balance among performance, computational complexity,
and ECG-specific characteristics, paving the way for high-performance,
lightweight computations in CVD diagnosis.

Result: 在三个胰腺癌队列的多组学数据中，hEFS相比传统的CoxLasso模型识别出更少、更稳定的生物标志物，同时保持相当的判别性能。

Conclusion: hEFS提供了一个稳健、可解释且具有临床价值的工具，用于高维生存环境下的预后建模和生物标志物发现。

Abstract: Prediction of patient survival using high-dimensional multi-omics data
requires systematic feature selection methods that ensure predictive
performance, sparsity, and reliability for prognostic biomarker discovery. We
developed a hybrid ensemble feature selection (hEFS) approach that combines
data subsampling with multiple prognostic models, integrating both embedded and
wrapper-based strategies for survival prediction. Omics features are ranked
using a voting-theory-inspired aggregation mechanism across models and
subsamples, while the optimal number of features is selected via a Pareto
front, balancing predictive accuracy and model sparsity without any
user-defined thresholds. When applied to multi-omics datasets from three
pancreatic cancer cohorts, hEFS identifies significantly fewer and more stable
biomarkers compared to the conventional, late-fusion CoxLasso models, while
maintaining comparable discrimination performance. Implemented within the
open-source mlr3fselect R package, hEFS offers a robust, interpretable, and
clinically valuable tool for prognostic modelling and biomarker discovery in
high-dimensional survival settings.

Conclusion: 该研究为AI驱动分析领域提供了一种有前景的方向，通过结合语义运算符的优化执行和深度研究系统的灵活性，能够在保持高效的同时提供更好的分析效果。

Abstract: With advances in large language models (LLMs), researchers are creating new
systems that can perform AI-driven analytics over large unstructured datasets.
Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic
operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural
language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be
expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution
semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another
line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer
natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more
LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively
refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their
query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven
analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of
semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep
Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype
which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic
operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can
outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research
systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,
our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we
give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still
achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its

TL;DR: app.build是一个开源框架，通过系统化验证和结构化环境改进基于LLM的应用程序生成，实现了73.3%的可行率和30%的完美质量评分


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高LLM应用生成的可靠性和质量，通过系统化验证和结构化环境来解决现有方法在生成可靠AI代理方面的局限性

Method: 结合多层验证管道、特定技术栈编排和模型无关架构，在三个参考技术栈上实现，包含30个生成任务的评估

Result: 全面验证实现73.3%的可行率，30%达到完美质量评分；开源模型在结构化环境中达到闭源模型80.8%的性能；社区已生成3000多个应用

Conclusion: 扩展可靠AI代理需要扩展环境而不仅仅是模型，为生产导向的代理系统提供了实证见解和完整参考实现

Abstract: We present app.build (https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent/), an open-source
framework that improves LLM-based application generation through systematic
validation and structured environments. Our approach combines multi-layered
validation pipelines, stack-specific orchestration, and model-agnostic
architecture, implemented across three reference stacks. Through evaluation on
30 generation tasks, we demonstrate that comprehensive validation achieves
73.3% viability rate with 30% reaching perfect quality scores, while
open-weights models achieve 80.8% of closed-model performance when provided
structured environments. The open-source framework has been adopted by the
community, with over 3,000 applications generated to date. This work
demonstrates that scaling reliable AI agents requires scaling environments, not
just models -- providing empirical insights and complete reference
implementations for production-oriented agent systems.

Abstract: This community paper developed out of the NSF Workshop on the Future of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Mathematical and Physics Sciences (MPS),
which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains
(Astronomy, Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics)
can best capitalize on, and contribute to, the future of AI. We present here a
summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer
2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming
increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link
between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully
leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes
opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from
fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic
priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an
interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and
workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with
a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational
institutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to
be a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of

Motivation: 解决自适应探索方法中何时在探索和利用之间切换的关键问题，特别是在需要学习长而复杂动作序列的领域中

Method: 提出了一个通用的自适应探索框架，使用不确定性来原则性地处理切换时机问题，可以整合各种不确定性测量机制（如内在动机或认知不确定性方法）

Result: 实验证明该框架产生的自适应探索策略在多个MuJoCo环境中优于标准方法

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个原则性的方法来处理探索-利用切换问题，具有通用性且性能优越

Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via
alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for
such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between
exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that
require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we
present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to
address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes
previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can
incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for
instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based
exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives
rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across
several MuJoCo environments.

### [124] [Lower Bounds for Linear Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02730)
*Young Kun Ko*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: 该论文证明了在cell-probe模型下，对于随机线性算子，任何数据结构计算线性查询的时间复杂度下界为Ω(min{log(m/s), n/log s})，突破了传统对数障碍，并部分解决了多个长期猜想。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 突破静态数据结构中的对数障碍，验证非线性预处理对大多数线性算子计算无实质性帮助的民间猜想，并推进Multiphase猜想和Jukna-Schnitger猜想的解决。

Method: 使用随机线性算子，通过cell-probe模型分析数据结构的查询时间下界，并扩展到电路复杂度下界证明。

Result: 证明了对于随机线性算子M∈F₂^{m×n}，任何大小为s的数据结构计算查询⟨M_i,X⟩的时间下界为t≥Ω(min{log(m/s), n/log s})，同时获得了深度d电路的线数下界Ω(n·log^{1/d}(n))。

Conclusion: 该工作首次显著突破了静态数据结构的对数障碍，部分解决了多个长期存在的猜想，为线性算子计算的理论下界提供了重要进展。

Abstract: We consider a static data structure problem of computing a linear operator
under cell-probe model. Given a linear operator $M \in \mathbb{F}_2^{m \times
n}$, the goal is to pre-process a vector $X \in \mathbb{F}_2^n$ into a data
structure of size $s$ to answer any query $\langle M_i , X \rangle$ in time
$t$. We prove that for a random operator $M$, any such data structure requires:
  $$ t \geq \Omega ( \min \{ \log (m/s) , n / \log s \} ).$$ This result
overcomes the well-known logarithmic barrier in static data structures [MNSW98,
Sie04, PD06, PTW08, Pat11, DGW19] by using a random linear operator.
Furthermore, it provides the first significant progress toward confirming a
decades-old folklore conjecture: that non-linear pre-processing does not
substantially help in computing most linear operators.
  A straightforward modification of our proof also yields a wire lower bound of
$\Omega(n \cdot \log^{1/d}(n))$ for depth-$d$ circuits with arbitrary gates
that compute a specific linear operator $M \in \mathbb{F}_2^{O(n) \times n}$,
even against some small constant advantage over random guessing. This bound
holds even for circuits with only a small constant advantage over random
guessing, improving upon longstanding results [RS03, Che08a, Che08b, GHK+13]
for a random operator.
  Finally, our work partially resolves the communication form of the Multiphase
Conjecture [Pat10] and makes progress on Jukna-Schnitger's Conjecture [JS11,
Juk12]. We address the former by considering the Inner Product (mod 2) problem
(instead of Set Disjointness) when the number of queries $m$ is
super-polynomial (e.g., $2^{n^{1/3}}$), and the total update time is
$m^{0.99}$. Our result for the latter also applies to cases with
super-polynomial $m$.

TL;DR: 提出在匿名图中使用量子pebbles进行静态宝藏搜索的新方法，量子pebbles通过发射量子比特编码路径信息，使oblivious agent能在D步内找到宝藏


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统经典pebbles在匿名图搜索中存在信息传输受限和遍历复杂度高的问题，特别是对于oblivious agents不够有效，需要探索量子信息的新方法

Method: 使用量子pebbles周期性发射固定量子态的qubits，每个pebble用唯一量子态编码下一节点的端口号，agent通过多基测量来区分状态确定正确路径

Result: oblivious agent能在D步内使用D个量子pebbles找到宝藏，每个节点仅需O((log D + log Δ)/(log 1/δ))次测量即可确保高成功概率

Conclusion: 量子pebbles不仅能模拟经典pebbles功能，还能提供更高效率，为量子增强分布式算法提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: We investigate the problem of finding a static treasure in anonymous graphs
using oblivious agents and introduce a novel approach that leverages quantum
information. In anonymous graphs, vertices are unlabelled, indistinguishable,
and edges are locally labelled with port numbers. Agents typically rely on
stationary classical pebbles placed by an oracle to guide their search.
However, this classical approach is constrained by limited information
transmission and high traversal complexity. Classical pebbles are not
sufficient for search if the agents are oblivious. We propose the first use of
quantum pebbles for search in anonymous graphs. Quantum pebbles periodically
emit qubits in a fixed quantum state. Each pebble encodes the port number to
the next node using a unique quantum state. The agent determines the correct
path by performing measurements in multiple bases, exploiting the probabilistic
nature of quantum measurement to distinguish states. We show that this strategy
enables an oblivious agent to locate the treasure in $D$ steps using $D$
quantum pebbles, where $D$ is the length of the shortest path between the
starting point and the treasure. Moreover, only $O((\log D + \log \Delta)/(\log
1/\delta))$ measurements per node are required to ensure high success
probability in a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ where $\delta =
\cos^2(\frac{\pi}{2\Delta})$. We propose the use of quantum information as a
guidance mechanism in anonymous graph search. We demonstrate that quantum
pebbles can not only emulate the functionality of classical pebbles but can do
so with improved efficiency, offering a promising direction for future
quantum-enhanced distributed algorithms.

Abstract: Quantum communication resources offer significant advantages for
fault-tolerant distributed protocols, particularly in Byzantine Agreement (BA),
where reliability against adversarial interference is essential. Quantum
Detectable Byzantine Agreement (QDBA) enables consensus protocols that surpass
classical limitations by leveraging entangled quantum states. In this work, we
focus on the practical realization of QDBA using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
pairs, the simplest maximally entangled quantum resources, making the protocol
experimentally accessible across current quantum hardware platforms. We present
a comprehensive computational study of the EPRQDBA protocol under realistic
quantum network conditions, utilizing the Aliro Quantum Network Simulator to
evaluate the performance and robustness of the protocol. Our simulations
systematically explore the protocol's parameter space --including variations in
network size, traitorous node count, the amount of entanglement consumed in the
protocol, and physically motivated noise models tailored specifically for
superconducting and photonic qubit technologies. Through extensive numerical
experiments, we provide insights into how these physically realistic parameters
impact protocol performance, establishing critical thresholds and optimal
operational regimes for experimental implementations. This work bridges
theoretical advances in quantum consensus protocols with practical network
implementations, offering a concrete reference for experimentalists. Our
findings serve as a guideline for evaluating and optimizing QDBA
implementations in realistic, noisy environments.

Motivation: 量子计算机的发展需要可访问的软件框架，但量子调试缺乏系统性指南。研究者希望通过分析真实的量子bug来提供调试技巧的指导。

Method: 收集14个来自量子软件开发经验和GitHub开源仓库的量子bug，详细描述它们的上下文、症状、识别和修复技术，并进行分类分析。

Result: 发现大多数量子bug是由算法或工作流中多个方面的独特交互引起的，这解释了为什么量子调试更养复杂。调试策略与bug类型之间没有明确关联。

Conclusion: 量子调试面临着重大挑战，需要进一步研究来开发有效的系统性调试策略。对量子bug的实证研究为调试方法的发展提供了重要见解。

Abstract: As quantum computers continue to improve in quality and scale, there is a
growing need for accessible software frameworks for programming them. However,
the unique behavior of quantum systems means specialized approaches, beyond
traditional software development, are required. This is particularly true for
debugging due to quantum bugs, i.e., bugs that occur precisely because an
algorithm is a quantum algorithm. Pinpointing a quantum bug's root cause often
requires significant developer time, as there is little established guidance
for quantum debugging techniques. Developing such guidance is the main
challenge we sought to address. In this work, we describe a set of 14 quantum
bugs, sourced primarily from our experience as quantum software developers, and
supplemented by analysis of open-source GitHub repositories. We detail their
context, symptoms, and the techniques applied to identify and fix them. While
classifying these bugs based on existing schemes, we observed that most emerged
due to unique interactions between multiple aspects of an algorithm or
workflow. In other words, they occurred because more than one thing went wrong,
which provided important insight into why quantum debugging is more
challenging. Furthermore, based on this clustering, we found that -
unexpectedly - there is no clear relationship between debugging strategies and
bug classes. Further research is needed to develop effective and systematic
quantum debugging strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交流系统研究需要解决大量AC载负流问题以模拟多样化场景，量子计算的最新进展为加速这些研究提供了新的可能性。

Method: 1）将AC PF问题构造为非线性最小二乘拟合问题，使用VQC进行混合经典/量子计算解决
2）将PF规格作为特征输入到数据嵌入式VQC中，训练量子机器学习模型
3）开发新的协议来高效测量AC-PF量子观测量，利用电力网络的图结构

Result: 初步数值测试显示，所提出的VQC模型虽然使用更少的权重，但预测性能超过了深度神经网络。

Conclusion: 这个量子AC-PF框架为通过量子计算处理更复杂的电网任务奠定了基础。

Abstract: Interconnection studies require solving numerous instances of the AC load or
power flow (AC PF) problem to simulate diverse scenarios as power systems
navigate the ongoing energy transition. To expedite such studies, this work
leverages recent advances in quantum computing to find or predict AC PF
solutions using a variational quantum circuit (VQC). VQCs are trainable models
that run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to
accomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks. Our first
contribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear
least-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it
using a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is
to feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the
resultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third
contribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF
quantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network.
Preliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain
enhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much
fewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for
addressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing.

Motivation: 研究动机是量化停电事件的社会影响，特别是人口密度不同区域的差异影响，以及停电对不同社会组群的不平等影响。

Method: 研究提出了一个标准化流程，将用户权重停电暳露转换为沪失指标，结合三个恢复指标：平均停电天数、恢复持续时间和相对恢复速率，并与邮政编码区域人口统计数据相结合。应用于四次美国台风事件的分析。

Result: 结果显示了退行性模式，低收入区域承受更大的停电负担。机制分析显示沪失随着恢复持续时间增加而增加，随着恢复速率提高而减少。恢复持续时间被识别为主要驱动因素。聚类分析揭示了传统可靠性指标无法捐捕的特异恢复类型。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种可转移的方法，用于评估停电影响和公平性，为跨事件比较提供了证据，并支持基于公平性的恢复规划和弹性投资。

Abstract: The multifaceted nature of disaster impact shows that densely populated areas
contribute more to aggregate burden, while sparsely populated but heavily
affected regions suffer disproportionately at the individual level. This study
introduces a framework for quantifying the societal impacts of power outages by
translating customer weighted outage exposure into deprivation measures,
integrating welfare metrics with three recovery indicators, average outage days
per customer, restoration duration, and relative restoration rate, computed
from sequential EAGLE I observations and linked to Zip Code Tabulation Area
demographics. Applied to four United States hurricanes, Beryl 2024 Texas,
Helene 2024 Florida, Milton 2024 Florida, and Ida 2021 Louisiana, this
standardized pipeline provides the first cross event, fine scale evaluation of
outage impacts and their drivers. Results demonstrate regressive patterns with
greater burdens in lower income areas, mechanistic analysis shows deprivation
increases with longer restoration durations and decreases with faster
restoration rates, explainable modeling identifies restoration duration as the
dominant driver, and clustering reveals distinct recovery typologies not
captured by conventional reliability metrics. This framework delivers a
transferable method for assessing outage impacts and equity, comparative cross
event evidence linking restoration dynamics to social outcomes, and actionable
spatial analyses that support equity informed restoration planning and
resilience investment.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于神经场和高斯过程的物理感知复合核方法，用于连续表示声场导向向量，解决了传统确定性超分辨率方法在测量空间非均匀不确定性下的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导向向量表示方法无法处理声场散射效应，而现有的物理感知深度学习方法虽然有效，但在测量空间非均匀不确定性下容易过拟合，需要更好的概率框架来解决这个问题。

Method: 将神经场（NF）的表达性表示集成到基于高斯过程（GP）的概率框架中，提出了物理感知复合核来建模方向性入射波和后续散射效应。

Result: 在数据不足条件下，该方法表现出有效性。在下游任务如语音增强和双耳渲染中，使用SPEAR挑战赛的模拟数据，仅需不到十分之一的测量次数就能达到oracle性能。

Conclusion: 提出的NF-GP复合方法能够有效解决声场导向向量连续表示中的不确定性建模问题，在数据稀缺情况下仍能保持优异性能，为增强听觉应用提供了精确的声场控制手段。

Abstract: This paper investigates continuous representations of steering vectors over
frequency and position of microphone and source for augmented listening (e.g.,
spatial filtering and binaural rendering) with precise control of the sound
field perceived by the user. Steering vectors have typically been used for
representing the spatial characteristics of the sound field as a function of
the listening position. The basic algebraic representation of steering vectors
assuming an idealized environment cannot deal with the scattering effect of the
sound field. One may thus collect a discrete set of real steering vectors
measured in dedicated facilities and super-resolve (i.e., upsample) them.
Recently, physics-aware deep learning methods have been effectively used for
this purpose. Such deterministic super-resolution, however, suffers from the
overfitting problem due to the non-uniform uncertainty over the measurement
space. To solve this problem, we integrate an expressive representation based
on the neural field (NF) into the principled probabilistic framework based on
the Gaussian process (GP). Specifically, we propose a physics-aware composite
kernel that model the directional incoming waves and the subsequent scattering
effect. Our comprehensive comparative experiment showed the effectiveness of
the proposed method under data insufficiency conditions. In downstream tasks
such as speech enhancement and binaural rendering using the simulated data of
the SPEAR challenge, the oracle performances were attained with less than ten
times fewer measurements.

Abstract: We present a system for automatic multi-axis perceptual quality prediction of
generative audio, developed for Track 2 of the AudioMOS Challenge 2025. The
task is to predict four Audio Aesthetic Scores--Production Quality, Production
Complexity, Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness--for audio generated by
text-to-speech (TTS), text-to-audio (TTA), and text-to-music (TTM) systems. A
main challenge is the domain shift between natural training data and synthetic
evaluation data. To address this, we combine BEATs, a pretrained
transformer-based audio representation model, with a multi-branch long
short-term memory (LSTM) predictor and use a triplet loss with buffer-based
sampling to structure the embedding space by perceptual similarity. Our results
show that this improves embedding discriminability and generalization, enabling
domain-robust audio quality assessment without synthetic training data.

Motivation: 解决现有自动说话评估方法的两大问题：1）语音SSL模型忽视语言内容，文本SSL模垃依赖ASR输出且无法编码语调细微差别；2）大多数方法将语言能力级别作为名义分类，忽视了其顺序结构和非均匀间隔。

Method: 提出结合SSL表征与手工特征的新题模型范式，并介绍了多边远秩损失函数，能够联合模型语言能力级别的顺序性和非均匀间隔特性。

Conclusion: 该研究有效解决了自动说话评估中的关键问题，通过结合SSL表征与手工特征的方法，以及考虑语言能力级别顺序性和非均匀间隔的模型设计，显著提升了评估性能。

Abstract: A recent line of research on automated speaking assessment (ASA) has
benefited from self-supervised learning (SSL) representations, which capture
rich acoustic and linguistic patterns in non-native speech without underlying
assumptions of feature curation. However, speech-based SSL models capture
acoustic-related traits but overlook linguistic content, while text-based SSL
models rely on ASR output and fail to encode prosodic nuances. Moreover, most
prior arts treat proficiency levels as nominal classes, ignoring their ordinal
structure and non-uniform intervals between proficiency labels. To address
these limitations, we propose an effective ASA approach combining SSL with
handcrafted indicator features via a novel modeling paradigm. We further
introduce a multi-margin ordinal loss that jointly models both the score
ordinality and non-uniform intervals of proficiency labels. Extensive
experiments on the TEEMI corpus show that our method consistently outperforms
strong baselines and generalizes well to unseen prompts.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper studies the complexity of finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point
for stochastic bilevel optimization when the upper-level problem is nonconvex
and the lower-level problem is strongly convex. Recent work proposed the
first-order method, F${}^2$SA, achieving the
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$ upper complexity bound for first-order
smooth problems. This is slower than the optimal $\Omega(\epsilon^{-4})$
complexity lower bound in its single-level counterpart. In this work, we show
that faster rates are achievable for higher-order smooth problems. We first
reformulate F$^2$SA as approximating the hyper-gradient with a forward
difference. Based on this observation, we propose a class of methods
F${}^2$SA-$p$ that uses $p$th-order finite difference for hyper-gradient
approximation and improves the upper bound to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(p
\epsilon^{4-p/2})$ for $p$th-order smooth problems. Finally, we demonstrate
that the $\Omega(\epsilon^{-4})$ lower bound also holds for stochastic bilevel
problems when the high-order smoothness holds for the lower-level variable,
indicating that the upper bound of F${}^2$SA-$p$ is nearly optimal in the
highly smooth region $p = \Omega( \log \epsilon^{-1} / \log \log
\epsilon^{-1})$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代成像科学中的逆问题需要高效的数据驱动正则化方法，学习去噪器作为隐式先验在迭代重建算法中展现出卓越性能

Method: 利用近端分裂算法(如ADMM和PGD)将学习去噪器替代近端算子，讨论Tweedie公式连接最优高斯去噪器和分数估计，分析RED和扩散后验采样方法

Result: 建立了PnP算法的收敛理论框架，明确了去噪器需要满足的非扩张性、Lipschitz连续性和局部同质性等结构假设

Conclusion: PnP方法为成像逆问题提供了强大的数据驱动正则化框架，理论分析和实践设计为该方法的应用奠定了坚实基础

Abstract: Inverse problems lie at the heart of modern imaging science, with broad
applications in areas such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and microscopy.
Recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in solving imaging inverse
problems, where data-driven regularizers are used increasingly, leading to
remarkably high-fidelity reconstruction. A particularly notable approach for
data-driven regularization is to use learned image denoisers as implicit priors
in iterative image reconstruction algorithms. This survey presents a
comprehensive overview of this powerful and emerging class of algorithms,
commonly referred to as plug-and-play (PnP) methods. We begin by providing a
brief background on image denoising and inverse problems, followed by a short
review of traditional regularization strategies. We then explore how proximal
splitting algorithms, such as the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) and proximal gradient descent (PGD), can naturally accommodate learned
denoisers in place of proximal operators, and under what conditions such
replacements preserve convergence. The role of Tweedie's formula in connecting
optimal Gaussian denoisers and score estimation is discussed, which lays the
foundation for regularization-by-denoising (RED) and more recent
diffusion-based posterior sampling methods. We discuss theoretical advances
regarding the convergence of PnP algorithms, both within the RED and proximal
settings, emphasizing the structural assumptions that the denoiser must satisfy
for convergence, such as non-expansiveness, Lipschitz continuity, and local
homogeneity. We also address practical considerations in algorithm design,
including choices of denoiser architecture and acceleration strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社区检测方法常产生不连通或弱连通簇，影响可解释性和鲁棒性。虽然WCC和CM算法能改善这一问题，但在大规模图上计算成本过高。

Method: 使用HPE Chapel编程语言设计并行算法，利用其并行构造实现性能提升和可扩展性，并将软件集成到Arkouda/Arachne高性能图分析框架中。

Conclusion: 该工作为大规模图上的连通性保持聚类提供了实用解决方案，显著提升了WCC和CM算法在大规模图上的计算效率。

Abstract: Community detection plays a central role in uncovering meso scale structures
in networks. However, existing methods often suffer from disconnected or weakly
connected clusters, undermining interpretability and robustness. Well-Connected
Clusters (WCC) and Connectivity Modifier (CM) algorithms are post-processing
techniques that improve the accuracy of many clustering methods. However, they
are computationally prohibitive on massive graphs. In this work, we present
optimized parallel implementations of WCC and CM using the HPE Chapel
programming language. First, we design fast and efficient parallel algorithms
that leverage Chapel's parallel constructs to achieve substantial performance
improvements and scalability on modern multicore architectures. Second, we
integrate this software into Arkouda/Arachne, an open-source, high-performance
framework for large-scale graph analytics. Our implementations uniquely enable
well-connected community detection on massive graphs with more than 2 billion
edges, providing a practical solution for connectivity-preserving clustering at
web scale. For example, our implementations of WCC and CM enable community
detection of the over 2-billion edge Open-Alex dataset in minutes using 128
cores, a result infeasible to compute previously.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了四种时序图神经网络(GNN)在移动通信网络数据上的表现，发现ROLAND GNN在大多数情况下超过基准模型，但性能优势并不显著，需要更专门的GNN架构研究。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GNN已成为图结构数据分析的独钢技术，但在使用移动通信数据分析时序社交网络方面还未得到充分研究。本研究旨在填补这一空白，评估GNN在移动通信网络数据分析中的效果。

Method: 研究了四种基于快照的时序GNN模型，用于预测移动通信网络中用户间的电话和短信活动。同时开发了一个简单的非GNN基准模型(EdgeBank)进行对比。

Result: ROLAND时序GNN在大多数情况下表现超过基准模型，但其他三种GNN的平均表现不如基准模型。GNN方法在时序社交网络分析中展现了潜力，但ROLAND与基准模型的性能差距较小。

Conclusion: GNN基础方法在通过移动连接数据分析时序社交网络方面具有前景，但由于性能优势不显著，需要进一步研究专门的GNN架构来提高时序社交网络分析的性能。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art data-driven
tool for modeling connectivity data of graph-structured complex networks and
integrating information of their nodes and edges in space and time. However, as
of yet, the analysis of social networks using the time series of people's
mobile connectivity data has not been extensively investigated. In the present
study, we investigate four snapshot - based temporal GNNs in predicting the
phone call and SMS activity between users of a mobile communication network. In
addition, we develop a simple non - GNN baseline model using recently proposed
EdgeBank method. Our analysis shows that the ROLAND temporal GNN outperforms
the baseline model in most cases, whereas the other three GNNs perform on
average worse than the baseline. The results show that GNN based approaches
hold promise in the analysis of temporal social networks through mobile
connectivity data. However, due to the relatively small performance margin
between ROLAND and the baseline model, further research is required on
specialized GNN architectures for temporal social network analysis.

Motivation: 自动说话评估(ASA)模型遇到类别不平衡问题，导致对少数类的偏见预测，影响评估的准确性和公平性

Method: 提出平衡逻辑变异(BLV)损失函数，通过干扰模型预测来改善少数类的特征表征，无需修改数据集

Result: 在ICNALE标准数据集上，将BLV损失集成到BERT模型中显著提升了分类准确性和公平性

Conclusion: BLV损失函数能够有效解决ASA模型的类别不平衡问题，使自动语音评估更加稳健适合多样化学习者

Abstract: Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) plays a crucial role in evaluating
second-language (L2) learners proficiency. However, ASA models often suffer
from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions. To address this, we
introduce a novel objective for training ASA models, dubbed the Balancing Logit
Variation (BLV) loss, which perturbs model predictions to improve feature
representation for minority classes without modifying the dataset. Evaluations
on the ICNALE benchmark dataset show that integrating the BLV loss into a
celebrated text-based (BERT) model significantly enhances classification
accuracy and fairness, making automated speech evaluation more robust for
diverse learners.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用知识编辑作为轻量级指纹注入方法保护LLM知识产权，并针对大规模微调导致的指纹退化问题提出了指纹子空间感知微调(FSFT)方法，显著提升了指纹持久性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有通过指令调优注入指纹的方法会显著降低模型性能、需要大量计算资源，且在模型修改后指纹持久性差。知识编辑提供了一种更轻量级的替代方案。

Method: 首次将知识编辑应用于指纹注入，使用乱码文本作为指纹防止被微调覆盖。针对大规模微调导致的退化问题，提出了FSFT方法，通过约束指纹子空间的更新来减少指纹退化。

Result: FSFT在最坏情况下性能超过普通微调10%。研究发现指纹注入模型难以区分指纹和相似文本，因为它们的特征高度相似。

Conclusion: 知识编辑是有效的轻量级指纹注入方法，FSFT能显著提升指纹持久性。当前方法仍需更鲁棒和细粒度的指纹注入技术来解决特征相似性问题。

Abstract: The intellectual property (IP) protection of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly critical. Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through
instruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may
significantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational
resources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue
that knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable
for fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to
fingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability.
Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being
overwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale
fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning
(FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the
fingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even
in the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the
fingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and
similar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding
underscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting
injection methods for LLMs.

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation systems face the challenge of integrating
fine-grained user and item relationships across various product domains. To
address this, we introduce RankGraph, a scalable graph learning framework
designed to serve as a core component in recommendation foundation models
(FMs). By constructing and leveraging graphs composed of heterogeneous nodes

user-user graphs to support similarity-based retrieval and real-time
clustering. Furthermore, RankGraph integrates graph-based pretrained
representations as contextual tokens into FM sequence models, enriching them

Method: 提出RecBase模型，使用推荐导向目标预训练，采用统一项目分词器将项目编码为分层概念标识符，通过自回归目标捕捉项目级序列模式

Result: 在8个真实数据集上，1.5B参数的模型在零样本和跨域推荐任务中匹配或超越了7B参数的LLM基线模型

Conclusion: RecBase通过推荐导向的预训练和统一的项目表示，有效解决了LLM在跨域推荐中的泛化问题，为推荐系统提供了新的基础模型解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-based recommendation have shown promise, yet their
cross-domain generalization is hindered by a fundamental mismatch between
language-centric pretraining and the recommendation task. Existing methods,
relying on language-level knowledge, fail to capture dynamic, item-level user
interests across domains. To bridge this gap, we propose RecBase, a
domain-agnostic foundational model pretrained with a recommendation-oriented
objective. RecBase leverages a large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-domain corpus
with unified textual representations and feature mappings to enhance
cross-domain generalization. To further align item semantics across domains, we
introduce a unified item tokenizer that encodes items into hierarchical concept
identifiers, enabling structured representation and efficient vocabulary
sharing. The model is trained using an autoregressive objective to capture
complex item-level sequential patterns. On eight real-world datasets, our
1.5B-parameter model matches or surpasses the performance of LLM baselines up
to 7B parameters in zero-shot and cross-domain recommendation tasks.

Abstract: We propose a general model-agnostic Contrastive learning framework with
Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing (CCSS) for modeling the monotonicity
between the neural network output and numerical features which is critical for
interpretability and effectiveness of recommender systems. CCSS models the
monotonicity via a two-stage process: synthesizing counterfactual samples and
contrasting the counterfactual samples. The two techniques are naturally
integrated into a model-agnostic framework, forming an end-to-end training
process. Abundant empirical tests are conducted on a publicly available dataset
and a real industrial dataset, and the results well demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed CCSS. Besides, CCSS has been deployed in our real

Motivation: 传统高保真求解器在参数空间中数值评估参数化偏微分方程计算成本高昂，需要开发更高效的替代模型。

Method: 使用POD降维技术参数化高维PDE解，在降维系数空间进行GP建模；结合物理定律和少量参数样本来校正GP后验均值；构建插值函数描述参数空间到物理校正项的映射；集成RBF-FD方法处理不规则几何。

Conclusion: 该方法成功整合了数据驱动学习和物理约束，避免了依赖计算昂贵的数值求解器，为复杂几何上的多耦合变量提供了灵活高效的代理建模解决方案。

Abstract: Parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental mathematical
tools for modeling complex physical systems, yet their numerical evaluation
across parameter spaces remains computationally intensive when using
conventional high-fidelity solvers. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel physical law-corrected prior Gaussian process (LC-prior GP) surrogate
modeling framework that effectively integrates data-driven learning with
underlying physical constraints to flexibly handle multi-coupled variables
defined on complex geometries. The proposed approach leverages proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD) to parameterize high-dimensional PDE solutions
via their dominant modes and associated coefficients, thereby enabling
efficient Gaussian process (GP) surrogate modeling within a reduced-dimensional
coefficient space. A key contribution lies in the incorporation of physical
laws together with a limited number of parameter samples to correct the GP
posterior mean, thus avoiding reliance on computationally expensive numerical
solvers. Furthermore, interpolation functions are constructed to describe the
mapping from the full parameter space to the physics-based correction term.
This mapping is subsequently backpropagated to constrain the original GP
surrogate, yielding a more physically consistent conditional prior. To handle
irregular geometries, the radial basis function-finite difference (RBF-FD)
method is incorporated during training set computation, with its inherent
differentiation matrices providing both computational efficiency and numerical
accuracy for physical constraint optimization. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments involving a
reaction-diffusion model, miscible flooding models, and Navier-Stokes equations
with multi-physics coupling defined on irregular domains.

Abstract: Kernel methods are powerful tools in statistical learning, but their cubic
complexity in the sample size n limits their use on large-scale datasets. In
this work, we introduce a scalable framework for kernel regression with O(n log
n) complexity, fully leveraging GPU acceleration. The approach is based on a
Fourier representation of kernels combined with non-uniform fast Fourier
transforms (NUFFT), enabling exact, fast, and memory-efficient computations. We
instantiate our framework in three settings: Sobolev kernel regression,
physics-informed regression, and additive models. When known, the proposed
estimators are shown to achieve minimax convergence rates, consistent with
classical kernel theory. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods can
process up to tens of billions of samples within minutes, providing both
statistical accuracy and computational scalability. These contributions
establish a flexible approach, paving the way for the routine application of
kernel methods in large-scale learning tasks.

Motivation: 流式生成模型在处理具有多尺度傅里叶谱的科学数据时，往往在精细尺度特征上产生较大误差，需要改进噪声分布和插值策略来提高建模效果。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models can face significant challenges when modeling
scientific data with multiscale Fourier spectra, often producing large errors
in fine-scale features. We address this problem within the framework of
stochastic interpolants, via principled design of noise distributions and
interpolation schedules. The key insight is that the noise should not be
smoother than the target data distribution -- measured by Fourier spectrum
decay rates -- to ensure bounded drift fields near the initial time. For
Gaussian and near-Gaussian distributions whose fine-scale structure is known,
we show that spectrum-matched noise improves numerical efficiency compared to
standard white-noise approaches. For complex non-Gaussian distributions, we
develop scale-adaptive interpolation schedules that address the numerical
ill-conditioning arising from rougher-than-data noise. Numerical experiments on
synthetic Gaussian random fields and solutions to the stochastic Allen-Cahn and
Navier-Stokes equations validate our approach and demonstrate its ability to
generate high-fidelity samples at lower computational cost than traditional
approaches.

Method: 基于函数ANOVA分解扩展BART模型，将函数变异性分解为不同交互作用，每个交互代表不同协变量集的贡献

Result: ANOVA-BART在预测精度和不确定性量化方面超越BART，后验集中率接近极小极大最优，并提供各交互作用的收敛速率

Conclusion: ANOVA-BART通过平衡预测准确性、可解释性和理论一致性，成为BART的有力替代方案

Abstract: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a powerful statistical model
that leverages the strengths of Bayesian inference and regression trees. It has
received significant attention for capturing complex non-linear relationships
and interactions among predictors. However, the accuracy of BART often comes at
the cost of interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose ANOVA
Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (ANOVA-BART), a novel extension of BART
based on the functional ANOVA decomposition, which is used to decompose the
variability of a function into different interactions, each representing the
contribution of a different set of covariates or factors. Our proposed
ANOVA-BART enhances interpretability, preserves and extends the theoretical
guarantees of BART, and achieves superior predictive performance. Specifically,
we establish that the posterior concentration rate of ANOVA-BART is nearly
minimax optimal, and further provides the same convergence rates for each
interaction that are not available for BART. Moreover, comprehensive
experiments confirm that ANOVA-BART surpasses BART in both accuracy and
uncertainty quantification, while also demonstrating its effectiveness in
component selection. These results suggest that ANOVA-BART offers a compelling
alternative to BART by balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and
theoretical consistency.

Result: 预研究结果显示KL-Shampoo提升了Shampoo的性能，无需Adam即可稳定，甚至超越了Adam稳定版本SOAP在神经网络预训练中的表现。

Conclusion: 从KL散度最小化角度分析Shampoo揭礴了其隐藏限制，KL-Shampoo作为一种改进方案，不仅节省内存，还提高了性能。

Abstract: As an adaptive method, Shampoo employs a structured second-moment estimation,
and its effectiveness has attracted growing attention. Prior work has primarily
analyzed its estimation scheme through the Frobenius norm. Motivated by the
natural connection between the second moment and a covariance matrix, we
propose studying Shampoo's estimation as covariance estimation through the lens
of Kullback-Leibler (KL) minimization. This alternative perspective reveals a
previously hidden limitation, motivating improvements to Shampoo's design.
Building on this insight, we develop a practical estimation scheme, termed
KL-Shampoo, that eliminates Shampoo's reliance on Adam for stabilization,
thereby removing the additional memory overhead introduced by Adam. Preliminary
results show that KL-Shampoo improves Shampoo's performance, enabling it to
stabilize without Adam and even outperform its Adam-stabilized variant, SOAP,
in neural network pretraining.

Abstract: We consider the problem of directly optimizing a non-linear function of an
outcome, where this outcome itself is the sum of many small contributions. The
non-linearity of the function means that the problem is not equivalent to the
maximization of the expectation of the individual contribution. By leveraging
the concentration properties of the sum of individual outcomes, we derive a
scalable descent algorithm that directly optimizes for our stated objective.
This allows for instance to maximize the probability of successful A/B test,
for which it can be wiser to target a success criterion, such as exceeding a
given uplift, rather than chasing the highest expected payoff.

assuming that better estimators inherently yield superior policies. Although
theoretically justified, we argue this estimator-centric approach neglects a
critical practical obstacle: challenging optimization landscapes. In this
paper, we provide theoretical insights and extensive empirical evidence showing
that current OPL methods encounter severe optimization issues, particularly as
action spaces become large. We demonstrate that simpler weighted log-likelihood
objectives enjoy substantially better optimization properties and still recover
competitive, often superior, learned policies. Our findings emphasize the
necessity of explicitly addressing optimization considerations in the
development of OPL algorithms for large action spaces.

Abstract: This study explores the deployment of three machine learning (ML) approaches
for real-time prediction of glucose, lactate, and ammonium concentrations in
cell culture processes, using Raman spectroscopy as input features. The
research addresses challenges associated with limited data availability and
process variability, providing a comparative analysis of pretrained models,
just-in-time learning (JITL), and online learning algorithms. Two industrial
case studies are presented to evaluate the impact of varying bioprocess
conditions on model performance. The findings highlight the specific conditions
under which pretrained models demonstrate superior predictive accuracy and
identify scenarios where JITL or online learning approaches are more effective
for adaptive process monitoring. This study also highlights the critical
importance of updating the deployed models/agents with the latest offline
analytical measurements during bioreactor operations to maintain the model
performance against the changes in cell growth behaviours and operating
conditions throughout the bioreactor run. Additionally, the study confirms the
usefulness of a simple mixture-of-experts framework in achieving enhanced
accuracy and robustness for real-time predictions of metabolite concentrations
based on Raman spectral data. These insights contribute to the development of
robust strategies for the efficient deployment of ML models in dynamic and
changing biomanufacturing environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于梯度的敏感性度量方法来解决决策依赖博弈中的分布偏移问题，无需依赖不切实际的β平滑性假设，并开发了敏感性感知的重复训练算法来保证收敛到性能稳定均衡。

Conclusion: 所提出的敏感性度量方法和算法能够有效处理任意数据分布映射，保证收敛到性能稳定均衡，为决策依赖博弈提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In decision-dependent games, multiple players optimize their decisions under
a data distribution that shifts with their joint actions, creating complex
dynamics in applications like market pricing. A practical consequence of these
dynamics is the \textit{performatively stable equilibrium}, where each player's
strategy is a best response under the induced distribution. Prior work relies
on $\beta$-smoothness, assuming Lipschitz continuity of loss function gradients
with respect to the data distribution, which is impractical as the data
distribution maps, i.e., the relationship between joint decision and the
resulting distribution shifts, are typically unknown, rendering $\beta$
unobtainable. To overcome this limitation, we propose a gradient-based
sensitivity measure that directly quantifies the impact of decision-induced
distribution shifts. Leveraging this measure, we derive convergence guarantees
for performatively stable equilibria under a practically feasible assumption of
strong monotonicity. Accordingly, we develop a sensitivity-informed repeated
retraining algorithm that adjusts players' loss functions based on the
sensitivity measure, guaranteeing convergence to performatively stable
equilibria for arbitrary data distribution maps. Experiments on prediction
error minimization game, Cournot competition, and revenue maximization game
show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving lower
losses and faster convergence.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is central to computational advertising, achieving notable
commercial success by optimizing advertisers' bids within economic constraints.
Recently, large generative models show potential to revolutionize auto-bidding
by generating bids that could flexibly adapt to complex, competitive
environments. Among them, diffusers stand out for their ability to address
sparse-reward challenges by focusing on trajectory-level accumulated rewards,
as well as their explainable capability, i.e., planning a future trajectory of
states and executing bids accordingly. However, diffusers struggle with
generation uncertainty, particularly regarding dynamic legitimacy between
adjacent states, which can lead to poor bids and further cause significant loss
of ad impression opportunities when competing with other advertisers in a
highly competitive auction environment. To address it, we propose a Causal
auto-Bidding method based on a Diffusion completer-aligner framework, termed
CBD. Firstly, we augment the diffusion training process with an extra random
variable t, where the model observes t-length historical sequences with the
goal of completing the remaining sequence, thereby enhancing the generated
sequences' dynamic legitimacy. Then, we employ a trajectory-level return model
to refine the generated trajectories, aligning more closely with advertisers'
objectives. Experimental results across diverse settings demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves superior performance on large-scale auto-bidding
benchmarks, such as a 29.9% improvement in conversion value in the challenging
sparse-reward auction setting, but also delivers significant improvements on
the Kuaishou online advertising platform, including a 2.0% increase in target
cost.

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

Motivation: 脑内动脉瘤存在重大临床风险，但缺乏注释的3D数据限制了其检测、描述和建模能力，需要创新方法来解决这些挑战

Method: 提出跨领域特征转移方法，利用TRELLIS生成模型在大规模非医疗3D数据上学习的载体几何嵌入特征，替代传统的点法向或网格描述符，应用于三个下游任务

Result: 实验结果显示，包含TRELLIS特征在准确性、F1分数和分割质量方面都显著超越了最先进的基线方法，并将模拟误差减少15%

Conclusion: 这些结果证明了将通用生成模型的3D表示转移到专业医疗任务的广阔潜力，为解决医疗图像分析中的数据稀缺问题提供了新的视角

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to
detect, delineate and model due to limited annotated 3D data. We propose a
cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader
potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative
models to specialized medical tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TADM-3D模型，使用3D扩散模型和脑年龄估计器来准确预测MRI脑部随时间的变化，解决了现有方法在时间关系建模和3D上下文利用方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI预测方法存在三个主要问题：无法明确捕捉结构变化与时间间隔的关系、仅依赖扫描插值缺乏临床实用性、以及大多基于2D架构忽略3D解剖上下文。需要开发能够准确预测脑部病理进展的3D方法。

Method: 提出3D时间感知扩散模型(TADM-3D)，使用预训练的脑年龄估计器(BAE)指导扩散模型生成准确反映年龄差异的MRI。引入回溯时间正则化(BITR)，通过双向训练（从基线到随访以及从随访到基线）提高时间准确性。

Conclusion: TADM-3D通过结合脑年龄估计和双向训练正则化，有效解决了现有方法在时间建模和3D上下文利用方面的限制，为临床提供更准确的脑部病理进展预测工具。

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 解决人群密度估计中依赖精细位置标注的问题，这些标注收集耗时且难以扩展，限制了实际应用的可扩展性

Method: 使用历史图库生成伪密度图，通过超几何分布采样估计人群区域，并添加自监督对比空间正则化器来增强空间感知能力

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于跨域适应方法，在半监督设置下比现有最先进方法表现更好，能够有效从计数标注中提取空间信息

Conclusion: Count2Density成功证明了仅使用计数级标注就能训练出准确的人群密度估计模型，为减少标注负担提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理高速数据流时，每步重新计算SVD分解成本过高，需要更高效的增量更新算法来处理短时间低秩变化。

Method: 提出两种新算法：1)基于家建子变换的紧凑算法，将稀疏部分与低秩更新解耦，内存需求降低一半；2)基于吉雷斯旋转的算法，每次旋转只需约10次浮点运算，复杂度从立方降为平方。

Result: 算法精度与SVD相似，在推荐系统和网络大子空间追踪中表现优异，效王超过LAPACK和增量SVD等常见软件。

Conclusion: 新算法能够高效处理高通量数据流更新，在保持精度的同时显著提升计算效王。

Abstract: For a datastream, the change over a short interval is often of low rank. For
high throughput information arranged in matrix format, recomputing an optimal
SVD approximation after each step is typically prohibitive. Instead,
incremental and truncated updating strategies are used, which may not scale for
large truncation ranks. Therefore, we propose a set of efficient new algorithms
that update a bidiagonal factorization, and which are similarly accurate as the
SVD methods. In particular, we develop a compact Householder-type algorithm
that decouples a sparse part from a low-rank update and has about half the
memory requirements of standard bidiagonalization methods. A second algorithm
based on Givens rotations has only about 10 flops per rotation and scales
quadratically with the problem size, compared to a typical cubic scaling. The
algorithm is therefore effective for processing high-throughput updates, as we
demonstrate in tracking large subspaces of recommendation systems and networks,
and when compared to well known software such as LAPACK or the incremental SVD.

Abstract: Accurate breast MRI lesion detection is critical for early cancer diagnosis,
especially in high-risk populations. We present a classification pipeline that
adapts a pretrained foundation model, the Medical Slice Transformer (MST), for
breast lesion classification using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI).
Leveraging DINOv2-based self-supervised pretraining, MST generates robust
per-slice feature embeddings, which are then used to train a Kolmogorov--Arnold
Network (KAN) classifier. The KAN provides a flexible and interpretable
alternative to conventional convolutional networks by enabling localized
nonlinear transformations via adaptive B-spline activations. This enhances the
model's ability to differentiate benign from malignant lesions in imbalanced
and heterogeneous clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the
MST+KAN pipeline outperforms the baseline MST classifier, achieving AUC = 0.80
\pm 0.02 while preserving interpretability through attention-based heatmaps.
Our findings highlight the effectiveness of combining foundation model
embeddings with advanced classification strategies for building robust and
generalizable breast MRI analysis tools.
