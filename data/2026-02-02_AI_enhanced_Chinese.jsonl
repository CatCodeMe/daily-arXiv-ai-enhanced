Improvement of Action Learning in Lifelong Learning", "categories": ["cs.DB"], "comment": null, "summary": "For now 10 years, the Action Learning has allowed employees of University of Angers, private and public Companies to be initiated with the design of database, on projects financed by professional structures. These innovating training periods are carried out within the framework of the University College of Further Education of the University of Angers. Database design is a process initially reserved to the professional data processing specialists, coming from French Level-2 technological courses (2-year degrees) or Engineer Schools (Master). The pedagogical model of technological courses has integrated for more than 20 years transverse semester projects, in order to give the students the opportunity to apply newly acquired knowledge, coordinated by teachers. Action Learning requires teachers to assume the role of supervisors for the project management. The objective of Action Learning is to transmit not only knowledge from teachers, but also the experience of consultants to trainees having no competence in data processing, but who have the knowledge of their business process. The present paper shows that Action Learning puts together the factors for success of French technological courses, the adaptability of pedagogy provided to the vocational training, and finally the competence of service provider, Keeping the best parts of those three complementary approaches makes it possible for this kind of formation to achieve teaching and professional, assessable and long lasting goals. Action Learning belongs to the French policy that aims to improve the volume and the quality of the contracts between Universities and companies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6602\u70ed\u5927\u5b66\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8ba9\u4f01\u4e1a\u5458\u5de5\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57f9\u8bad\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6280\u672f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u3001\u804c\u4e1a\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u54a8\u8be2\u670d\u52a1\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6559\u5b66\u4e0e\u804c\u4e1a\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u662f\u4e13\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u4f01\u4e1a\u5458\u5de5\u4e86\u89e3\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u5374\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u884c\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u6280\u672f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u804c\u4e1a\u57f9\u8bad\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u54a8\u8be2\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u5458\u5de5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57f9\u8bad\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u884c\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7531\u6602\u70ed\u5927\u5b66\u7ee7\u7eed\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u9662\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u6559\u5e08\u62c5\u4efb\u9879\u76ee\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u57f9\u8bad\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u4e1a\u673a\u6784\u8d44\u52a9\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5c06\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u6388\u4e0e\u54a8\u8be2\u987e\u95ee\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u8ba9\u5b66\u5458\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65b0\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u884c\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u6cd5\u56fd\u6280\u672f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6210\u529f\u8981\u7d20\uff1a\u6280\u672f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u6a2a\u5411\u5b66\u671f\u9879\u76ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u804c\u4e1a\u57f9\u8bad\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6559\u5b66\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u54a8\u8be2\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u57f9\u8bad\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u804c\u4e1a\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u884c\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u6cd5\u56fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5927\u5b66\u4e0e\u4f01\u4e1a\u5408\u4f5c\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6280\u672f\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u804c\u4e1a\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u54a8\u8be2\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u6280\u672f\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u5458\u5de5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57f9\u8bad\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6559\u5b66\u4e0e\u804c\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

High-utility sequential rule mining (HUSRM) aims at discovering sequential rules with high utility and high confidence. It can certainly provide reliable information for decision-making because it uses confidence as an evaluation metric, as well as some algorithms like HUSRM and US-Rule. However, in current rule-growth mining methods, the linkage between HUSRs and their generation remains ambiguous. Specifically, it is unclear whether the addition of new items affects the utility or confidence of the former rule, leading to an increase or decrease in their values. Therefore, in this paper, we formulate the problem of mining HUSRs with an increasing utility ratio. To address this, we introduce a novel algorithm called SRIU for discovering all HUSRs with an increasing utility ratio using two distinct expansion methods, including left-right expansion and right-left expansion. SRIU also utilizes the item pair estimated utility pruning strategy (IPEUP) to reduce the search space. Moreover, for the two expansion methods, two sets of upper bounds and corresponding pruning strategies are introduced. To enhance the efficiency of SRIU, several optimizations are incorporated. These include utilizing the Bitmap to reduce memory consumption and designing a compact utility table for the mining procedure. Finally, extensive experimental results from both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, to better assess the quality of the generated sequential rules, metrics such as confidence and conviction are employed, which further demonstrate that SRIU can improve the relevance of mining results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSRIU\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6316\u6398\u5177\u6709\u9012\u589e\u6548\u7528\u6bd4\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de6\u53f3\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53f3\u5de6\u6269\u5c55\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5219\u6316\u6398\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u5176\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u65b0\u589e\u9879\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6548\u7528\u6216\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u9012\u589e\u6548\u7528\u6bd4\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u6316\u6398\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSRIU\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5de6\u53f3\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53f3\u5de6\u6269\u5c55\u4e24\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9879\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\u6548\u7528\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565(IPEUP)\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e24\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u754c\u548c\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Bitmap\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7d27\u51d1\u6548\u7528\u8868\u4f18\u5316\u6316\u6398\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u786e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5219\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eSRIU\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6316\u6398\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SRIU\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6316\u6398\u5177\u6709\u9012\u589e\u6548\u7528\u6bd4\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6316\u6398\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

When these items can form multiple distinct rules, additional utility calculations are required. To address this issue, this study proposes a sequential rule mining algorithm that utilizes segmentation guided by confidence (RSC), which employs confidence-guided segmentation to reduce redundant utility computation. It adopts a method that precomputes the confidence of segmented rules by leveraging the support of candidate subsequences in advance. Once the segmentation point is determined, all rules with different antecedents and consequents are generated simultaneously. RSC uses a utility-linked table to accelerate candidate sequence generation and introduces a stricter utility upper bound, called the reduced remaining utility of a sequence, to address sequences with duplicate items.

A k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) query is one such example that finds the k closest POIs from an agent's location. While most existing techniques focus on retrieving nearby POIs for a single agent, these search heuristics do not translate to many other applications. For example, Aggregate k Nearest Neighbor (AkNN) queries require POIs that are close to multiple agents. k Farthest Neighbor (kFN) queries require POIs that are the antithesis of nearest. Such problems naturally benefit from a hierarchical approach, but existing methods rely on Euclidean-based heuristics, which have diminished effectiveness in graphs such as road networks. We propose a novel data structure, COL-Tree (Compacted Object-Landmark Tree), to address this gap by enabling efficient hierarchical graph traversal using a more accurate landmark-based heuristic.

KevlarFlow leverages 1) decoupled model parallelism initialization, 2) dynamic traffic rerouting, and 3) background KV cache replication to maintain high throughput during partial failures. Our evaluation demonstrates that KevlarFlow reduces mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR) by 20x and, under failure conditions, improves average latency by 3.1x, 99th percentile (p99) latency by 2.8x, average time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 378.9x, and p99 TTFT by 574.6x with negligible runtime overhead in comparison to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "KevlarFlow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u884c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u6d41\u91cf\u91cd\u8def\u7531\u548c\u540e\u53f0KV\u7f13\u5b58\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6545\u969c\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u670d\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\u9762\u5bf9\u786c\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u65f6\u975e\u5e38\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\u8fc7\u6162\uff08\u9700\u8981\u957f\u8fbe10\u5206\u949f\u91cd\u65b0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u52a0\u8f7d\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u65ad\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u957f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a1) \u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u884c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c2) \u52a8\u6001\u6d41\u91cf\u91cd\u8def\u7531\uff0c3) \u540e\u53f0KV\u7f13\u5b58\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u6545\u969c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "result": "KevlarFlow\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4(MTTR)\u964d\u4f4e20\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u6545\u969c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff1a\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63d0\u53473.1\u500d\uff0cp99\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63d0\u53472.8\u500d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u9996token\u65f6\u95f4(TTFT)\u63d0\u5347378.9\u500d\uff0cp99 TTFT\u63d0\u5347574.6\u500d\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "KevlarFlow\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, existing IBM methods focus solely on maximizing blocking effectiveness, overlooking fairness across communities. To address this issue, we formalize fairness in IBM and justify Demographic Parity (DP) as a notion that is particularly well aligned with its semantics. Yet enforcing DP is computationally challenging: prior work typically formulates DP as a Linear Programming (LP) problem and relies on costly solvers, rendering them impractical for large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose a DP-aware objective while maintaining an approximately monotonic submodular structure, enabling efficient optimization with theoretical guarantees. We integrate this objective with blocking effectiveness through a tunable scalarization, yielding a principled fairness-effectiveness trade-offs. Building on this structure, we develop CELF-R, an accelerated seed selection algorithm that exploits approximate submodularity to eliminate redundant evaluations and naturally supports Pareto front construction.

This paper sheds light on the hidden carbon emissions of frequency regulation service. Our work explores how modern GPU data centers can coordinate with power grids to reduce the need for fossil-fueled frequency regulation reserves. We first introduce a novel metric, Exogenous Carbon, to quantify grid-side carbon emission reductions resulting from data center participation in regulation service. We additionally introduce EcoCenter, a framework to maximize the amount of frequency regulation provision that GPU data centers can provide, and thus, reduce the amount of frequency regulation reserves necessary.

The pre-training technology has shown promise by learning general traffic representations from raw byte sequences, thereby reducing reliance on labeled data. However, existing pre-trained models struggle with the gap between traffic heterogeneity (i.e., hierarchical traffic structures) and input homogeneity (i.e., flattened byte sequences). To address this gap, we propose Nethira, a heterogeneity-aware pre-trained model based on hierarchical reconstruction and augmentation. In pre-training, Nethira introduces hierarchical reconstruction at multiple levels-byte, protocol, and packet-capturing comprehensive traffic structural information. During fine-tuning, Nethira proposes a consistency-regularized strategy with hierarchical traffic augmentation to reduce label dependence. Experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that Nethira outperforms seven existing pre-trained models, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 9.11%, and reaching comparable performance with only 1% labeled data on high-heterogeneity network tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Nethira\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c42\u6b21\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff08\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6d41\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u540c\u8d28\u6027\uff08\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u5b57\u8282\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6d41\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNethira\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u91cd\u6784\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u5b57\u8282\u3001\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5305\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\uff09\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u9762\u6d41\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u914d\u5408\u5c42\u6b21\u6d41\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u7b7e\u4f9d\u8d56", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNethira\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e03\u4e2a\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747F1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u53479.11%\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5f02\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ec5\u97001%\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "Nethira\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6d41\u91cf\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56"}}

The highly distributed and interdependent nature of modern cloud-based systems often complicates RCA efforts, particularly for multi-hop fault propagation, where symptoms appear far from their true causes. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities to enhance automated RCA. However, their practical value for RCA depends on the fidelity of reasoning and decision-making. Existing work relies on historical incident corpora, operates directly on high-volume telemetry beyond current LLM capacity, or embeds reasoning inside complex multi-agent pipelines -- conditions that obscure whether failures arise from reasoning itself or from peripheral design choices.\n  We present a focused empirical evaluation that isolates an LLM's reasoning behavior. We design a controlled experimental framework that foregrounds the LLM by using a simplified experimental setting. We evaluate six LLMs under two agentic workflows (ReAct and Plan-and-Execute) and a non-agentic baseline on two real-world case studies (GAIA and OpenRCA). In total, we executed 48,000 simulated failure scenarios, totaling 228 days of execution time. We measure both root-cause accuracy and the quality of intermediate reasoning traces. We produce a labeled taxonomy of 16 common RCA reasoning failures and use an LLM-as-a-Judge for annotation. Our results clarify where current open-source LLMs succeed and fail in multi-hop RCA, quantify sensitivity to input data modalities, and identify reasoning failures that predict final correctness.

This growth couples scheduling decisions with feasibility: a scheduler must minimize latency under a hard memory budget, yet the response lengths of requests are inherently unknown. While recent works have explored this problem either assuming clairvoyance -- exact knowledge of response lengths -- or relying on machine-learned predictions, obtaining robust performance guarantees without any prior knowledge of job sizes remains a theoretically fundamental and practically important open problem.\n  In this work, we propose the Geometric Slicing Algorithm (GSA), the non-clairvoyant policy to achieve the first constant competitive ratio for this problem in the offline batch setting. GSA manages uncertainty through a geometric phase structure that periodically restarts jobs to bound memory exposure, combined with a staggered pipeline mechanism that enables high concurrency by smoothing aggregate memory consumption. We prove that GSA achieves a competitive ratio of at most 61.92 for general instances, improving to 32 in the large-memory regime. Our algorithmic framework also yields a clairvoyant counterpart, the Geometric Batching Algorithm (GBA), which achieves an approximation ratio of 10.67 for general instances and 6.75 in the large-memory regime -- significantly improving upon the best previously known bound of over 9000.

The system operates under user mobility, dynamic blockages, colluding idle and active eavesdroppers, and transceiver and surface hardware impairments. A 3GPP and ITU-compliant stochastic channel model is developed, capturing mobility-induced covariance evolution, outdoor-indoor penetration losses, and distortion-aware noise due to practical EVM-based impairments. We aim to minimize the aggregate secrecy-outage probability subject to secrecy-rate constraints, QoS requirements, power limitations, and statistical CSI uncertainty. The resulting problem contains coupled secrecy and QoS chance constraints and nonlinear interactions among the BS beamforming vectors, multi-surface phase coefficients, and UAV position. To handle these difficulties, we derive rigorous Bernstein-type deterministic approximations for all chance constraints, yielding a distributionally robust reformulation. Building on this, we propose an alternating optimization framework that employs successive convex approximation (SCA) to convexify each block and solve the BS beamforming, RIS, STAR-RIS, H-RIS configuration, and UAV placement subproblems efficiently. The proposed algorithm is shown to monotonically decrease a smooth surrogate of the secrecy-outage cost and converge to a stationary point of the robustified problem. Simulations based on 3GPP TR 38.901, TR 36.873, and ITU-R P.2109 demonstrate that integrating UAV-RIS, STAR-RIS, and H-RIS significantly reduces secrecy-outage probability compared with benchmark schemes and provides strong robustness to channel uncertainty, blockages, colluding eavesdroppers, and hardware impairments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u4eba\u673aRIS\u3001\u5ba4\u5916STAR-RIS\u548c\u5ba4\u5185\u5168\u606fRIS\uff0c\u5728\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u906e\u6321\u3001\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4fdd\u5bc6\u4e2d\u65ad\u6982\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u7528\u6237\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u906e\u6321\u3001\u591a\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u7528\u6237\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u73af\u5883\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u73af\u5883\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u65e0\u4eba\u673aRIS\u3001\u5ba4\u5916STAR-RIS\u548c\u5ba4\u5185\u5168\u606fRIS\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u7b26\u54083GPP\u548cITU\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Bernstein\u578b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5904\u7406\u673a\u4f1a\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9010\u6b21\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ad9\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3001RIS\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6df7\u5408RIS\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4fdd\u5bc6\u4e2d\u65ad\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u906e\u6321\u3001\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5355\u8c03\u964d\u4f4e\u4fdd\u5bc6\u4e2d\u65ad\u4ee3\u4ef7\u5e76\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9c81\u68d2\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673aRIS\u3001STAR-RIS\u548c\u5168\u606fRIS\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4fdd\u5bc6\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u67656G\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In practice, however, pipeline jobs often fail intermittently due to non-deterministic tests, network outages, infrastructure failures, resource exhaustion, and other reliability issues. These intermittent (flaky) job failures lead to substantial inefficiencies: wasted computational resources from repeated reruns and significant diagnosis time that distracts developers from core activities and often requires intervention from specialized teams. Prior work has proposed machine learning techniques to detect intermittent failures, but does not address the subsequent diagnosis challenge. To fill this gap, we introduce FlaXifyer, a few-shot learning approach for predicting intermittent job failure categories using pre-trained language models. FlaXifyer requires only job execution logs and achieves 84.3% Macro F1 and 92.0% Top-2 accuracy with just 12 labeled examples per category.

We identify this phenomenon as middle-phase thrashing, a previously under-characterized pathology in which cache efficiency collapses as long-lived agents accumulate state over time.\n  We argue that mitigating this pathology requires moving beyond reactive, request-level cache management to proactive, agent-level admission control. Drawing inspiration from congestion control in distributed systems, we view the KV cache as a shared resource whose efficient utilization depends on feedback-driven regulation. Based on this insight, we present CONCUR, a lightweight control layer that regulates agent admission to bound aggregate cache pressure while preserving execution continuity. CONCUR adapts a cache-aware control algorithm to dynamically adjust the number of active agents using runtime cache signals.\n  Across large models and real-world agent workloads, CONCUR prevents middle-phase thrashing and improves batch inference throughput by up to 4.09x on Qwen3-32B and 1.9x on DeepSeek-V3, while remaining compatible with existing LLM serving systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "CONCUR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u51c6\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u6765\u9632\u6b62KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\u6296\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6279\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6279\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4GPU KV\u7f13\u5b58\u51fa\u73b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\u6296\u52a8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u7f13\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u968f\u7740\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u79ef\u7d2f\u72b6\u6001\u800c\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u672a\u8017\u5c3d\u4e5f\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u4f4e\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "method": "CONCUR\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u62e5\u585e\u63a7\u5236\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6d3b\u8dc3\u4ee3\u7406\u6570\u91cf\u4ee5\u9650\u5236\u805a\u5408\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6267\u884c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\uff0cCONCUR\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\u6296\u52a8\uff0c\u5728Qwen3-32B\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u6279\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u8fbe4.09\u500d\uff0c\u5728DeepSeek-V3\u4e0a\u63d0\u53471.9\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u51b3KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4e2d\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\u6296\u52a8\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u8bf7\u6c42\u7ea7\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u8f6c\u5411\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\u7ea7\u51c6\u5165\u63a7\u5236\uff0cCONCUR\u901a\u8fc7\u7f13\u5b58\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u8282\u4ee3\u7406\u51c6\u5165\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002"}}

This method takes advantage of the most recent stored updates from clients, even when they are absent from the current training round, thereby emulating their presence. Furthermore, we propose FedAdaVR-Quant, which stores client updates in quantised form, significantly reducing the memory requirements (by 50%, 75%, and 87.5%) of FedAdaVR while maintaining equivalent model performance. We analyse the convergence behaviour of FedAdaVR under general nonconvex conditions and prove that our proposed algorithm can eliminate partial client participation error.

While recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can generate correct and performant GPU kernels, kernel generation for neural processing units (NPUs) remains largely underexplored due to domain-specific programming models, limited public examples, and sparse documentation. Consequently, directly generating AscendC kernels with LLMs yields extremely low correctness, highlighting a substantial gap between GPU and NPU kernel generation.\n  We present AscendCraft, a DSL-guided approach for automatic AscendC kernel generation. AscendCraft introduces a lightweight DSL that abstracts non-essential complexity while explicitly modeling Ascend-specific execution semantics. Kernels are first generated in the DSL using category-specific expert examples and then transcompiled into AscendC through structured, constraint-driven LLM lowering passes. Evaluated on MultiKernelBench across seven operator categories, AscendCraft achieves 98.1% compilation success and 90.4% functional correctness. Moreover, 46.2% of generated kernels match or exceed PyTorch eager execution performance, demonstrating that DSL-guided transcompilation can enable LLMs to generate both correct and competitive NPU kernels.

While recent semantic-based parsers leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit superior generalizability over traditional syntax-based methods, their effectiveness is heavily contingent on model scale. This dependency leads to significant performance collapse when employing smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. Such degradation creates a major barrier to real-world adoption, where data privacy requirements and computational constraints necessitate the use of succinct models. To bridge this gap, we propose EFParser, an unsupervised LLM-based log parser designed to enhance the capabilities of smaller models through systematic architectural innovation. EFParser introduces a dual-cache system with an adaptive updating mechanism that distinguishes between novel patterns and variations of existing templates. This allows the parser to merge redundant templates and rectify prior errors, maintaining cache consistency. Furthermore, a dedicated correction module acts as a gatekeeper, validating and refining every LLM-generated template before caching to prevent error injection. Empirical evaluations on public large-scale datasets demonstrate that EFParser outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 12.5% across all metrics when running on smaller LLMs, even surpassing some baselines utilizing large-scale models. Despite its additional validation steps, EFParser maintains high computational efficiency, offering a robust and practical solution for real-world log analysis deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "EFParser\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u7f13\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u867d\u7136\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEFParser\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7f13\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff09\u533a\u5206\u65b0\u6a21\u677f\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u677f\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5408\u5e76\u5197\u4f59\u6a21\u677f\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6821\u6b63\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u7f13\u5b58\u524d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4f18\u5316LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u9519\u8bef\u6ce8\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEFParser\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd512.5%\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "EFParser\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u65e5\u5fd7\u5206\u6790\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u800c\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Such settings induce spurious state-action correlations, so standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- whether conditioning on raw measurements or ignoring them -- can converge to systematically biased policies under distribution shift. We propose a general framework for IL under measurement error, inspired by explicitly modeling the causal relationships among the variables, yielding a target that retains a causal interpretation and is robust to distribution shift. Building on ideas from proximal causal inference, we introduce \\texttt{CausIL}, which treats noisy state observations as proxy variables, and we provide identification conditions under which the target policy is recoverable from demonstrations without rewards or interactive expert queries. We develop estimators for both discrete and continuous state spaces; for continuous settings, we use an adversarial procedure over RKHS function classes to learn the required parameters. We evaluate \\texttt{CausIL} on semi-simulated longitudinal data from the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 cohort and demonstrate improved robustness to distribution shift compared to BC baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faCausIL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\uff0c\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u72b6\u6001\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u865a\u5047\u7684\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u51c6\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6709\u504f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684CausIL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u72b6\u6001\u89c2\u6d4b\u89c6\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u8fd1\u7aef\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc6\u522b\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528RKHS\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019\u961f\u5217\u7684\u534a\u6a21\u62df\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cCausIL\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u5904\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\uff0cCausIL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5956\u52b1\u6216\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e13\u5bb6\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

By prioritising availability over consistency under partition, nodes accumulate events in different orders, and rely on an associative, commutative and idempotent merge function to present a materialised view of the CRDT. Under some circumstances, the state of the materialised view over time can appear to ''roll back'' previously applied events. When the materialised view is used to manage group permissions such as ones found in instant messaging applications, this can lead to surprising behaviour. This can occur when there are multiple concurrent events, such as in the Duelling Admins problem where two equally permissioned admins concurrently revoke each other's permissions. Who wins? This article argues that a Byzantine admin can exploit concurrency to win the duel. As a result, an external arbiter is required to arbitrate an immutable happens-before relation between concurrent events. Arbitration occurs asynchronously in batches via optional ''epoch events'', preserving availability. This introduces a bounded total order within epochs, and the resulting ''finality'' improves on the level of consistency CRDTs can provide.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRDTs\u5728\u5e76\u53d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u72b6\u6001\"\u56de\u6eda\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6743\u9650\u7ba1\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\"\u51b3\u6597\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\"\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6b65\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7684\"\u7eaa\u5143\u4e8b\u4ef6\"\u4ef2\u88c1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u754c\u5168\u5e8f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347CRDT\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "CRDTs\u5728\u5206\u533a\u65f6\u4f18\u5148\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u800c\u975e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8282\u70b9\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u987a\u5e8f\u7d2f\u79ef\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u5e76\u51fd\u6570\u5448\u73b0\u7269\u5316\u89c6\u56fe\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7269\u5316\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u80fd\"\u56de\u6eda\"\u5148\u524d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f53\u7528\u4e8e\u7ba1\u7406\u5373\u65f6\u901a\u8baf\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7fa4\u7ec4\u6743\u9650\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5982\"\u51b3\u6597\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\"\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u540c\u65f6\u64a4\u9500\u5bf9\u65b9\u6743\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u4ef2\u88c1\u5668\u4ef2\u88c1\u5e76\u53d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8happens-before\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u4ef2\u88c1\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9009\u7684\"\u7eaa\u5143\u4e8b\u4ef6\"\u5f02\u6b65\u6279\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7eaa\u5143\u5185\u7684\u6709\u754c\u5168\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\"\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\"\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86CRDTs\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u754c\u5168\u5e8f\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e76\u53d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6743\u9650\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u5229\u7528\u5e76\u53d1\u6027\u8d62\u5f97\"\u51b3\u6597\"\u3002", "conclusion": "CRDTs\u5728\u6743\u9650\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6b65\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7eaa\u5143\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4ef2\u88c1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301CRDT\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5e76\u53d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Their massive volume, resulting from fine-grained measurements collected across many cells over long time horizons, poses significant challenges for storage, transport, and large-scale analysis. In this letter, we show that common cellular KPIs can be efficiently compressed using standard lossy compression schemes based on prediction, quantization, and entropy coding, achieving substantial reductions in reporting overhead. Focusing on traffic volume KPIs, we first characterize their intrinsic compressibility through a rate-distortion analysis, showing that signal-to-noise ratios around 30 dB can be achieved using only 3-4 bits per sample, corresponding to an 8-10x reduction with respect to 32-bit floating-point representations.

Our benchmark consists of GitHub repositories whose tests begin to fail in response to dependency updates. The construction process is fully automated, enabling live updates of the benchmark. Furthermore, we curated a human-verified subset to ensure problem solvability. We evaluated agent-based baselines built on top of 11 models, including both strong open-weight and state-of-the-art LLMs on this verified subset. Our results indicated that, while LLMs show some promise for migration tasks, they continue to face substantial reliability challenges, including spurious solutions that exploit low test coverage and unnecessary edits stemming from suboptimal tool-use strategies.

Existing approaches embed task-specific value functions into constrained optimization programs or learn deterministic structured policies, sacrificing generality and policy expressiveness. We propose a solver-induced \\emph{latent spherical flow policy} that brings the expressiveness of modern generative policies to combinatorial RL while guaranteeing feasibility by design. Our method, LSFlow, learns a \\emph{stochastic} policy in a compact continuous latent space via spherical flow matching, and delegates feasibility to a combinatorial optimization solver that maps each latent sample to a valid structured action. To improve efficiency, we train the value network directly in the latent space, avoiding repeated solver calls during policy optimization. To address the piecewise-constant and discontinuous value landscape induced by solver-based action selection, we introduce a smoothed Bellman operator that yields stable, well-defined learning targets.

To address this gap, we propose a low-cost and automated human activity recognition (HAR) framework based on wearable inertial sensors and machine learning. Activity data, including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying, were collected using accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. Four classical classifiers, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), were evaluated and compared with the proposed Support Tensor Machine (STM). Experimental results show that SVM achieved an accuracy of 93.33 percent, while Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and k-NN achieved 91.11 percent. In contrast, STM significantly outperformed these models, achieving a test accuracy of 96.67 percent and the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.50 percent. Unlike conventional methods, STM leverages tensor representations to preserve spatio-temporal motion dynamics, resulting in robust classification across diverse activities.

We propose DAJ, a reasoning-based LLM judge trained with verifiable rewards under a bi-level data-reweighted learning framework. The proposed framework learns data-importance weights (either domain-level or instance-level) to optimize generalization performance on a held-out meta set aligned with target benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of data reweighting to LLM-as-a-Judge training for test-time scaling. Our approach automatically emphasizes hard problems, in-distribution samples, and trajectory-aligned data, without relying on hand-crafted heuristics.

We propose ZK-HybridFL, a secure decentralized FL framework that integrates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) ledger with dedicated sidechains and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving model validation. The framework uses event-driven smart contracts and an oracle-assisted sidechain to verify local model updates without exposing sensitive data. A built-in challenge mechanism efficiently detects adversarial behavior. In experiments on image classification and language modeling tasks, ZK-HybridFL achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, lower perplexity, and reduced latency compared to Blade-FL and ChainFL. It remains robust against substantial fractions of adversarial and idle nodes, supports sub-second on-chain verification with efficient gas usage, and prevents invalid updates and orphanage-style attacks.

To mitigate this threat, the adoption of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is critical. In this work, we investigate the performance impact of PQC algorithms on WPA-Enterprise-based authentication. To this end, we conduct an experimental evaluation of authentication latency using a testbed built with the open-source tools FreeRADIUS and hostapd, measuring the time spent at the client, access point, and RADIUS server. We evaluate multiple combinations of PQC algorithms and analyze their performance overhead in comparison to currently deployed cryptographic schemes. Beyond performance, we assess the security implications of these algorithm choices by relating authentication mechanisms to the quantum effort required for their exploitation. This perspective enables a systematic categorization of PQ-relevant weaknesses in WPA-Enterprise according to their practical urgency. The evaluation results show that, although PQC introduces additional authentication latency, combinations such as ML-DSA-65 and Falcon-1024 used in conjunction with ML-KEM provide a favorable trade-off between security and performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the resulting overhead can be effectively mitigated through session resumption.

Given its success in mathematical reasoning, test-time scaling approaches such as Process Reward Model (PRM)-based Best-of-N selection offer a promising way to improve performance. However, existing PRMs remain ineffective for code generation due to the lack of meaningful step decomposition in code and the noise of Monte Carlo-estimated partial-solution correctness scores (rewards). To address these challenges, we propose FunPRM. FunPRM prompts LLMs to encourage modular code generation organized into functions, with functions treated as PRM reasoning steps.

However, standard methods for solving multi-agent games fail to learn correct protocols in this setting, even when the number of agents is small. We propose a learning framework, GGMS, which integrates a specialized variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search with a transformer-based action encoder, a global depth-first search to break out of local minima, and repeated feedback from a model checker. Protocols output by GGMS are verified correct via exhaustive model checking for all executions within the bounded setting.

Log parsing, which extracts structured events from massive unstructured log data, is a critical first step for downstream tasks like anomaly detection and failure diagnosis. With advances in large language models (LLMs), leveraging their strong text understanding capabilities has proven effective for accurate log parsing. However, existing LLM-based log parsers all focus on the constant part of logs, ignoring the potential contribution of the variable part to log parsing. This constant-centric strategy brings four key problems. First, inefficient log grouping and sampling with only constant information. Second, a relatively large number of LLM invocations due to constant-based cache, leading to low log parsing accuracy and efficiency. Third, a relatively large number of consumed constant tokens in prompts leads to high LLM invocation costs. At last, these methods only retain placeholders in the results, losing the system visibility brought by variable information in logs.\n  Facing these problems, we propose a variable-centric log parsing strategy named VarParser. Through variable contribution sampling, variable-centric parsing cache, and adaptive variable-aware in-context learning, our approach can efficiently capture the variable parts of logs and leverage their contributions to parsing. By introducing variable units, we preserve rich variable information, enhancing the integrity of log parsing results. Extensive evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that VarParser achieves higher accuracy compared to existing methods, significantly improving parsing efficiency while reducing the LLM invocation costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "VarParser\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u53d8\u91cf\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u90e8\u5206\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5e38\u91cf\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u90fd\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u5e38\u91cf\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf\u90e8\u5206\u5bf9\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5e38\u91cf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5e38\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u65e5\u5fd7\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u91c7\u6837\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e38\u91cf\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cfLLM\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u89e3\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u91cf\u5e38\u91cftoken\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8c03\u7528\u6210\u672c\uff1b4\uff09\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u53ea\u4fdd\u7559\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\uff0c\u4e22\u5931\u4e86\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e2d\u53d8\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVarParser\u53d8\u91cf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a1\uff09\u53d8\u91cf\u8d21\u732e\u91c7\u6837\uff1a\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u90e8\u5206\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5bf9\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff1b2\uff09\u53d8\u91cf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89e3\u6790\u7f13\u5b58\uff1a\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\uff1b3\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53d8\u91cf\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cVarParser\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89e3\u6790\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86LLM\u8c03\u7528\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "VarParser\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u91cf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e2d\u53d8\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

We introduce a simple symmetry-breaking protocol that inserts a preferred direction into this rotational space through batchwise-sampled, unlearned query and value biases. This modification has two theoretically motivated and empirically validated consequences. First, it can substantially improve the performance of simple, memory-efficient optimizers, narrowing -- and in some cases closing -- the gap to successful but more complex memory-intensive adaptive methods. We demonstrate this by pretraining 124M parameter transformer models with four optimization algorithms (AdamW, SOAP, SGDM, and Energy Conserving Descent(ECD)) and evaluating both validation loss and downstream logical reasoning.

This paradigm extends into deep learning through model reuse. Recently, model merging has emerged in the domain of large language models (LLMs) as a training-free approach that takes multiple task-specific models with the same architecture as source models and merges them without retraining, enhancing model reuse within LLMs. However, no prior work has systematically investigated whether such an approach can be effectively applied to other deep learning models with different architectures across domains. To bridge this gap, we present the first systematic study that evaluates five model merging techniques on three distinct model architectures across three domains: LLMs, image classification, and autonomous driving. Our findings reveal that directly applying existing model merging techniques leads to highly inconsistent results and falls notably short of their success within LLMs. Moreover, a single model merging technique often fails to handle the heterogeneous structural properties within a model, limiting its applicability to different model architectures across domains. Furthermore, the effectiveness of model merging techniques is highly sensitive to hyperparameter configurations, thereby constraining their potential for broader adoption. Inspired by these insights, we propose AutoMerge, a novel search-based model merging framework that first segments complex models into multiple heterogeneous blocks and then systematically explores the merging space to identify the merging technique and its hyperparameter configuration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u5728LLMs\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AutoMerge\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u4f18\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u91cd\u7528\u662f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bdd\u9898\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LLMs\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff08LLMs\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AutoMerge\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u5757\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u5408\u5e76\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8fdc\u4e0d\u5982\u5728LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\uff1b\u5355\u4e2a\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u5408\u5e76\u6548\u679c\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002AutoMerge\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We develop a classification-based framework that reformulates both static and dynamic survival analysis as a series of binary classification problems by discretizing event times. Censored observations are naturally handled as examples with missing labels at certain time points. This classification formulation enables existing tabular foundation models to perform survival analysis through in-context learning without explicit training. We prove that under standard censoring assumptions, minimizing our binary classification loss recovers the true survival probabilities as the training set size increases. We demonstrate through evaluation across $53$ real-world datasets that off-the-shelf tabular foundation models with this classification formulation outperform classical and deep learning baselines on average over multiple survival metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790", "motivation": "\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u53f3\u5220\u5931\u6570\u636e\uff08\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53d1\u751f\u524d\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec8\u6b62\uff09\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba9\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1", "method": "\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u5220\u5931\u89c2\u6d4b\u89c6\u4e3a\u67d0\u4e9b\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u6807\u7b7e\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790", "result": "\u572853\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8be5\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u73b0\u6210\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u751f\u5b58\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5220\u5931\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u751f\u5b58\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

Yet, traditional safety-case practices from aviation or nuclear engineering rely on well-specified system boundaries, stable architectures, and known failure modes. Modern AI systems such as generative and agentic AI are the opposite. Their capabilities emerge unpredictably from low-level training objectives, their behaviour varies with prompts, and their risk profiles shift through fine-tuning, scaffolding, or deployment context. This study examines how safety cases are currently constructed for AI systems and why classical approaches fail to capture these dynamics. It then proposes a framework of reusable safety-case templates, each following a predefined structure of claims, arguments, and evidence tailored for AI systems. The framework introduces comprehensive taxonomies for AI-specific claim types (assertion-based, constrained-based, capability-based), argument types (demonstrative, comparative, causal/explanatory, risk-based, and normative), and evidence families (empirical, mechanistic, comparative, expert-driven, formal methods, operational/field data, and model-based). Each template is illustrated through end-to-end patterns addressing distinctive challenges such as evaluation without ground truth, dynamic model updates, and threshold-based risk decisions. The result is a systematic, composable, and reusable approach to constructing and maintaining safety cases that are credible, auditable, and adaptive to the evolving behaviour of generative and frontier AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u6a21\u677f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u6765\u81ea\u822a\u7a7a\u3001\u6838\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\uff09\u5177\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u968f\u63d0\u793a\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u968f\u5fae\u8c03/\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u6a21\u677f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u677f\u9075\u5faa\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u58f0\u660e\u3001\u8bba\u8bc1\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff1aAI\u7279\u5b9a\u58f0\u660e\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u65ad\u8a00\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u3001\u8bba\u8bc1\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u6f14\u793a\u6027\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u6027\u3001\u56e0\u679c/\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u89c4\u8303\u6027\uff09\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u65cf\uff08\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u3001\u673a\u5236\u6027\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u6027\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c/\u73b0\u573a\u6570\u636e\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e94\u5bf9\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u7b49\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u548c\u524d\u6cbfAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6a21\u677f\u548c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, standard approaches typically rely on single-model confidence thresholds, which are frequently unreliable due to inherent calibration issues. To address this, we introduce SQUAD (Scalable Quorum Adaptive Decisions), the first inference scheme that integrates early-exit mechanisms with distributed ensemble learning, improving uncertainty estimation while reducing the inference time. Unlike traditional methods that depend on individual confidence scores, SQUAD employs a quorum-based stopping criterion on early-exit learners by collecting intermediate predictions incrementally in order of computational complexity until a consensus is reached and halting the computation at that exit if the consensus is statistically significant. To maximize the efficacy of this voting mechanism, we also introduce QUEST (Quorum Search Technique), a Neural Architecture Search method to select early-exit learners with optimized hierarchical diversity, ensuring learners are complementary at every intermediate layer. This consensus-driven approach yields statistically robust early exits, improving the test accuracy up to 5.95% compared to state-of-the-art dynamic solutions with a comparable computational cost and reducing the inference latency up to 70.60% compared to static ensembles while maintaining a good accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "SQUAD\u7ed3\u5408\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4eba\u6570\u7684\u505c\u6b62\u51c6\u5219\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u7ecf\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSQUAD\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4eba\u6570\u7684\u505c\u6b62\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u6309\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u987a\u5e8f\u6536\u96c6\u4e2d\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u76f4\u5230\u8fbe\u6210\u5171\u8bc6\u3002\u5f15\u5165QUEST\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u6b21\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fbe5.95%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c11\u8fbe70.60%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "SQUAD\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) could help by producing natural-language rationales, but their value for BVT has not been empirically assessed. We therefore conducted an exploratory study on LLM-generated boundary explanations: in a survey, twenty-seven software professionals rated GPT-4.1 explanations for twenty boundary pairs on clarity, correctness, completeness and perceived usefulness, and six of them elaborated in follow-up interviews. Overall, 63.5% of all ratings were positive (4-5 on a five-point Likert scale) compared to 17% negative (1-2), indicating general agreement but also variability in perceptions. Participants favored explanations that followed a clear structure, cited authoritative sources, and adapted their depth to the reader's expertise; they also stressed the need for actionable examples to support debugging and documentation. From these insights, we distilled a seven-item requirement checklist that defines concrete design criteria for future LLM-based boundary explanation tools. The results suggest that, with further refinement, LLM-based tools can support testing workflows by making boundary explanations more actionable and trustworthy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86GPT-4.1\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b063.5%\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u662f\u79ef\u6781\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u8fb9\u754c\u89e3\u91ca\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4e03\u9879\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u5206\u6790\u6d4b\u8bd5(BVT)\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4eba\u5458\u5e38\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\u67d0\u4e9b\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u4e3a\u4f55\u4ee3\u8868\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728BVT\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5c1a\u672a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u67e5\u8ba927\u540d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u5bf9GPT-4.1\u751f\u6210\u768420\u4e2a\u8fb9\u754c\u5bf9\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff08\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u7528\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u4e2d6\u4eba\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u7eed\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002", "result": "63.5%\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u662f\u79ef\u6781\u7684\uff085\u70b9\u674e\u514b\u7279\u91cf\u8868\u4e2d\u76844-5\u5206\uff09\uff0c17%\u662f\u6d88\u6781\u7684\uff081-2\u5206\uff09\u3002\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u504f\u597d\u7ed3\u6784\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u5f15\u7528\u6743\u5a01\u6765\u6e90\u3001\u6839\u636e\u8bfb\u8005\u4e13\u4e1a\u6c34\u5e73\u8c03\u6574\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u652f\u6301\u8c03\u8bd5\u548c\u6587\u6863\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c1\u89e3\u4e2d\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa\u4e86\u4e03\u9879\u9700\u6c42\u6e05\u5355\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u89e3\u91ca\u5de5\u5177\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u8fb9\u754c\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6765\u652f\u6301\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

We study this setting as Federated Domain-Incremental Learning (FDIL), where (i) clients are heterogeneous, (ii) tasks arrive sequentially with shifting domains, yet (iii) the label space remains fixed. Two theoretical pillars remain missing for FDIL under realistic deployment: a guarantee of backward knowledge transfer (BKT) and a convergence rate that holds across the sequence of all tasks with partial participation. We introduce SPECIAL (Server-Proximal Efficient Continual Aggregation for Learning), a simple, memory-free FDIL algorithm that adds a single server-side ``anchor'' to vanilla FedAvg: in each round, the server nudges the uniformly sampled participated clients update toward the previous global model with a lightweight proximal term. This anchor curbs cumulative drift without replay buffers, synthetic data, or task-specific heads, keeping communication and model size unchanged. Our theory shows that SPECIAL (i) preserves earlier tasks: a BKT bound caps any increase in prior-task loss by a drift-controlled term that shrinks with more rounds, local epochs, and participating clients; and (ii) learns efficiently across all tasks: the first communication-efficient non-convex convergence rate for FDIL with partial participation, O((E/NT)^(1/2)), with E local epochs, T communication rounds, and N participated clients per round, matching single-task FedAvg while explicitly separating optimization variance from inter-task drift.

Unlike traditional hardening tests, which pass at generation time, catching tests are meant to fail, surfacing bugs before code lands. The primary challenge is to reduce development drag from false positive test failures. Analyzing 22,126 generated tests, we show code-change-aware methods improve candidate catch generation 4x over hardening tests and 20x over coincidentally failing tests. To address false positives, we use rule-based and LLM-based assessors. These assessors reduce human review load by 70%. Inferential statistical analysis showed that human-accepted code changes are assessed to have significantly more false positives, while human-rejected changes have significantly more true positives. We reported 41 candidate catches to engineers; 8 were confirmed to be true positives, 4 of which would have led to serious failures had they remained uncaught. Overall, our results show that Just-in-Time catching is scalable, industrially applicable, and that it prevents serious failures from reaching production.", "AI": {"tldr": "Meta\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5373\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5927\u578b\u540e\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9884\u9632bug\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u52a0\u56fa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e8\u5728\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u843d\u5730\u524d\u53d1\u73b0bug\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6355\u83b7\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u89c4\u5219\u548cLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u4e25\u91cd\u6545\u969c\u8fdb\u5165\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u62e5\u6709\u6570\u4ebf\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u540e\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9884\u9632bug\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u52a0\u56fa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u843d\u5730\u524d\u4e3b\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0bug\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8bef\u62a5\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8d1f\u62c5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5373\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e8\u5728\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u53d1\u73b0bug\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5019\u9009\u6355\u83b7\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u57fa\u548cLLM\u57fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a5\u53d7/\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5019\u9009\u6355\u83b7\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u53474\u500d\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u52a0\u56fa\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u548c20\u500d\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u5076\u7136\u5931\u8d25\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u5c06\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u8d1f\u8f7d\u51cf\u5c1170%\u300241\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u6355\u83b7\u4e2d\uff0c8\u4e2a\u786e\u8ba4\u4e3a\u771f\u9633\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d4\u4e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u4e25\u91cd\u6545\u969c\u3002\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u53d8\u66f4\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u53d8\u66f4\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u771f\u9633\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u4e25\u91cd\u6545\u969c\u8fdb\u5165\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0bug\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684bug\u9884\u9632\u3002"}}

While the Shapley value offers a theoretically grounded approach to attribution, it faces a dual computational bottleneck: (i) the prohibitive cost of exhaustive model retraining for each sampled subset of players (i.e., data contributors) and (ii) the combinatorial number of subsets needed to estimate marginal contributions due to contributor interactions. To this end, we propose SurrogateSHAP, a retraining-free framework that approximates the expensive retraining game through inference from a pretrained model. To further improve efficiency, we employ a gradient-boosted tree to approximate the utility function and derive Shapley values analytically from the tree-based model. We evaluate SurrogateSHAP across three diverse attribution tasks: (i) image quality for DDPM-CFG on CIFAR-20, (ii) aesthetics for Stable Diffusion on Post-Impressionist artworks, and (iii) product diversity for FLUX.1 on Fashion-Product data. Across settings, SurrogateSHAP outperforms prior methods while substantially reducing computational overhead, consistently identifying influential contributors across multiple utility metrics.

Unlike heuristic improvements to existing optimizers, RLOs are systematically derived from a novel control-theoretic framework that reinterprets optimization as an extended state discrete-time controlled dynamical system on a Riemannian parameter manifold. Central to this framework is the identification of a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM), which organizes training dynamics into two distinct stages: rapid alignment of the speed state to a target graph, followed by controlled evolution within it. We formalize this by constructing a strict Lyapunov function that certifies convergence to a target manifold.

Dataset paper", "summary": "Microservice systems (MSS) have become a predominant architectural style for cloud services. Yet the community still lacks high-quality, publicly available datasets for anomaly detection (AD) and root cause analysis (RCA) in MSS. Most benchmarks emphasize performance-related faults and provide only one or two monitoring modalities, limiting research on broader failure modes and cross-modal methods. To address these gaps, we introduce a new multimodal anomaly dataset built on two open-source microservice systems: SocialNetwork and TrainTicket. We design and inject four categories of anomalies (Ano): performance-level, service-level, database-level, and code-level, to emulate realistic anomaly modes. For each scenario, we collect five modalities (Mod): logs, metrics, distributed traces, API responses, and code coverage reports, offering a richer, end-to-end view of system state and inter-service interactions. We name our dataset, reflecting its unique properties, as AnoMod. This dataset enables (1) evaluation of cross-modal anomaly detection and fusion/ablation strategies, and (2) fine-grained RCA studies across service and code regions, supporting end-to-end troubleshooting pipelines that jointly consider detection and localization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AnoMod\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u79cd\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4e94\u79cd\u76d1\u63a7\u6a21\u6001", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u6545\u969c\u4e14\u6a21\u6001\u5355\u4e00\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08SocialNetwork\u548cTrainTicket\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u4e86\u56db\u7c7b\u5f02\u5e38\uff08\u6027\u80fd\u7ea7\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7ea7\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff08\u65e5\u5fd7\u3001\u6307\u6807\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001API\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u62a5\u544a\uff09", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86AnoMod\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u878d\u5408/\u6d88\u878d\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76", "conclusion": "AnoMod\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7814\u7a76"}}

Using linear optimization over a set of interpretable pairwise metrics (e.g., gradient L2 distance), we uncover properties correlating with post-merge performance across four merging methods. We find substantial variation in success drivers (46.7% metric overlap; 55.3% sign agreement), revealing method-specific \"fingerprints\".

Effective model training requires not only large quantities of sensor data but also balanced coverage that includes rare yet safety-critical scenarios. Capturing such events demands extensive driving time and efficient selection. This paper introduces the Lambda framework, an edge-native platform that enables on-vehicle data filtering and processing through user-defined functions. The framework provides a serverless-inspired abstraction layer that separates application logic from low-level execution concerns such as scheduling, deployment, and isolation. By adapting Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) principles to resource-constrained automotive environments, it allows developers to implement modular, event-driven filtering algorithms while maintaining compatibility with ROS 2 and existing data recording pipelines. We evaluate the framework on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and compare it against native ROS 2 deployments.

However, its scalability remains severely constrained by (i) the necessity of processing temporal data sequentially and (ii) the prohibitive memory footprint of high-dimensional reservoirs. In this work, we revisit RC through the lens of structured operators and state space modeling to address these limitations, introducing Parallel Echo State Network (ParalESN). ParalESN enables the construction of high-dimensional and efficient reservoirs based on diagonal linear recurrence in the complex space, enabling parallel processing of temporal data. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that ParalESN preserves the Echo State Property and the universality guarantees of traditional Echo State Networks while admitting an equivalent representation of arbitrary linear reservoirs in the complex diagonal form. Empirically, ParalESN matches the predictive accuracy of traditional RC on time series benchmarks, while delivering substantial computational savings. On 1-D pixel-level classification tasks, ParalESN achieves competitive accuracy with fully trainable neural networks while reducing computational costs and energy consumption by orders of magnitude.

Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a promising direction by enabling iterative reasoning, tool use, and environment interaction to refine SAST alerts. However, the comparative effectiveness of different LLM-based agent architectures for FP filtering remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present a comparative study of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agent frameworks, i.e., Aider, OpenHands, and SWE-agent, for vulnerability FP filtering. We evaluate these frameworks using the vulnerabilities from the OWASP Benchmark and real-world open-source Java projects. The experimental results show that LLM-based agents can remove the majority of SAST noise, reducing an initial FP detection rate of over 92% on the OWASP Benchmark to as low as 6.3% in the best configuration. On real-world dataset, the best configuration of LLM-based agents can achieve an FP identification rate of up to 93.3% involving CodeQL alerts. However, the benefits of agents are strongly backbone- and CWE-dependent: agentic frameworks significantly outperform vanilla prompting for stronger models such as Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-5, but yield limited or inconsistent gains for weaker backbones. Moreover, aggressive FP reduction can come at the cost of suppressing true vulnerabilities, highlighting important trade-offs. Finally, we observe large disparities in computational cost across agent frameworks. Overall, our study demonstrates that LLM-based agents are a powerful but non-uniform solution for SAST FP filtering, and that their practical deployment requires careful consideration of agent design, backbone model choice, vulnerability category, and operational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11SAST\u5de5\u5177\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3001CWE\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u771f\u6f0f\u6d1e\u88ab\u6291\u5236\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "SAST\u5de5\u5177\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u8bef\u62a5\u7ed9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e26\u6765\u6c89\u91cd\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0cLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u671b\u4f18\u5316\u8bef\u62a5\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u6548\u679c\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff08Aider\u3001OpenHands\u3001SWE-agent\uff09\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8bef\u62a5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528OWASP Benchmark\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5f00\u6e90Java\u9879\u76ee\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11SAST\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5728OWASP Benchmark\u4e0a\u5c06\u521d\u59cb92%\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u964d\u81f3\u6700\u4f4e6.3%\uff1b\u771f\u5b9e\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u7f6e\u53ef\u8fbe93.3%\u8bef\u62a5\u8bc6\u522b\u7387\u3002\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u548cCWE\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\uff08Claude Sonnet 4\u3001GPT-5\uff09\u4e0a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u589e\u76ca\u6709\u9650\u6216\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8bef\u62a5\u51cf\u5c11\u53ef\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u771f\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u6846\u67b6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u662fSAST\u8bef\u62a5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u4f46\u975e\u5747\u5300\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u4ed4\u7ec6\u8003\u8651\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

A critical challenge with these models is the absence of calibrated uncertainty, which undermines trust in individual outputs for high-stakes applications. To address this issue, we propose a systematic conformal prediction approach tailored to conditional generative models, leveraging density estimation on model-generated samples. We introduce a novel method called CP4Gen, which utilizes clustering-based density estimation to construct prediction sets that are less sensitive to outliers, more interpretable, and of lower structural complexity than existing methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world applications, including climate emulation tasks, demonstrate that CP4Gen consistently achieves superior performance in terms of prediction set volume and structural simplicity. Our approach offers practitioners a powerful tool for uncertainty estimation associated with conditional generative models, particularly in scenarios demanding rigorous and interpretable prediction sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCP4Gen\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6", "motivation": "\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCP4Gen\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCP4Gen\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "CP4Gen\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u7684\u573a\u666f"}}

In practice, teams often draft multiple candidate proposals for fixing an issue and then deliberate on one golden proposal for implementation. This selection requires not only assessing the issue's scope, impact, and urgency, but also a clear understanding of each proposal's strengths and weaknesses. A good selection could make issue resolution more reliable while reducing regression and operational risk, whereas a poor choice can increase risk and even cause unpredictable failures.\n  We first conduct a manual study of real-world issues to characterize the rationales maintainers use when selecting among competing proposals. Motivated by these findings, we introduce SWE-Manager, a joint selection and synthesis approach that selects the best proposal and synthesizes a golden proposal. SWE-Manager is an 8B model trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to compare proposals, justify its choice, and synthesize a golden proposal for implementation. We view proposal selection as a reasoning task, mirroring how technical managers review competing proposals by weighing issue context and each proposal's solution without executing code or running tests. On the SWE-Lancer Manager benchmark, SWE-Manager achieves 53.21 selection accuracy and 57.75 earn rate, earning 152,750 dollars and outperforming strong baselines including GPT-5. To further evaluate the effectiveness of SWE-Manager in real-world issue resolution, we design the P2A framework, which simulates a real-world workflow where multiple proposals are drafted, reviewed, and a golden proposal is selected for implementation ...", "AI": {"tldr": "SWE-Manager\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u76848B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u63d0\u6848\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6848\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u9ec4\u91d1\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u5728SWE-Lancer Manager\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eGPT-5\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u56e2\u961f\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u63d0\u6848\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002\u597d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u800c\u5dee\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u98ce\u9669\u751a\u81f3\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6545\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u7ef4\u62a4\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u6848\u7684\u7406\u6027\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51faSWE-Manager\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u76848B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6bd4\u8f83\u63d0\u6848\u3001\u8bba\u8bc1\u9009\u62e9\u7406\u7531\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u9ec4\u91d1\u63d0\u6848\u3002\u5c06\u63d0\u6848\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6280\u672f\u7ecf\u7406\u5728\u4e0d\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u6216\u8fd0\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728SWE-Lancer Manager\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSWE-Manager\u8fbe\u523053.21%\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c57.75%\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u7387\uff0c\u8d5a\u53d6152,750\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5305\u62ecGPT-5\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7P2A\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SWE-Manager\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u6848\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u6280\u672f\u7ecf\u7406\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Additionally, the agent is equipped with file system capabilities to resolve complex project dependencies. Experiments on the SolEval+ Benchmark, a rigorous suite derived from high-quality real-world projects, demonstrate that SolAgent achieves a Pass@1 rate of up to \\textbf{64.39\\%}, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs ($\\sim$25\\%), AI IDEs (e.g., GitHub Copilot), and existing agent frameworks. Moreover, it reduces security vulnerabilities by up to \\textbf{39.77\\%} compared to human-written baselines.

Most prior methods cast this task as an optimization problem with limited theoretical grounding. We propose to cast workflow generation as Bayesian inference over a posterior distribution on workflows, and introduce \\textbf{Bayesian Workflow Generation (BWG)}, a sampling framework that builds workflows step-by-step using parallel look-ahead rollouts for importance weighting and a sequential in-loop refiner for pool-wide improvements. We prove that, without the refiner, the weighted empirical distribution converges to the target posterior.

Using proven and well-tested OSS components lets developers reduce development time and cost while improving quality. However, heavy reliance on open-source software also introduces significant security risks, including the incorporation of known vulnerabilities into the codebase. To mitigate these risks, metadata-based dependency scanners, which are lightweight and fast, and code-centric scanners, which enable the detection of modified dependencies hidden from metadata-based approaches, have been developed. In this paper, we present Unshade, a hybrid approach towards dependency scanning in Java that combines the efficiency of metadata-based scanning with the ability to detect modified dependencies of code-centric approaches. Unshade first augments a Java project's software bill of materials (SBOM) by identifying modified and hidden dependencies via a bytecode-based fingerprinting mechanism. This augmented SBOM is then passed to a metadata-based vulnerability scanner to identify known vulnerabilities in both declared and newly revealed dependencies. Leveraging Unshade's high scalability, we conducted a large-scale study of the 1,808 most popular open-source Java Maven projects on GitHub. The results show that nearly 50% of these projects contain at least one modified, hidden dependency associated with a known vulnerability. On average, each affected project includes more than eight such hidden vulnerable dependencies, all missed by traditional metadata-based scanners. Overall, Unshade identified 7,712 unique CVEs in hidden dependencies that would remain undetected when relying on metadata-based scanning alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "Unshade\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u4f9d\u8d56\u626b\u63cf\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u6570\u636e\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fee\u6539\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728Java\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u53d1\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5143\u6570\u636e\u626b\u63cf\u5668\u8f7b\u91cf\u5feb\u901f\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u800c\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5fc3\u626b\u63cf\u5668\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fee\u6539\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f46\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "Unshade\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5b57\u8282\u7801\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u673a\u5236\u8bc6\u522b\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u6269\u5145\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7269\u6599\u6e05\u5355(SBOM)\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u589e\u5f3a\u7684SBOM\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6f0f\u6d1e\u626b\u63cf\u5668\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u58f0\u660e\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e2d\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9GitHub\u4e0a1,808\u4e2a\u6700\u6d41\u884c\u7684Java Maven\u9879\u76ee\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8fd150%\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u5305\u542b\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u9690\u85cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u9879\u76ee\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc78\u4e2a\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5143\u6570\u636e\u626b\u63cf\u5668\u4f1a\u5168\u90e8\u6f0f\u6389\u3002Unshade\u5171\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa7,712\u4e2a\u9690\u85cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e2d\u7684\u552f\u4e00CVE\u3002", "conclusion": "Unshade\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u4f9d\u8d56\u626b\u63cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f20\u7edf\u5143\u6570\u636e\u626b\u63cf\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

ABF involves transforming a buggy method into its fixed equivalent. A common preprocessing step in ABF involves removing comments from code prior to training. However, we hypothesize that comments may play a critical role in fixing certain types of bugs by providing valuable design and implementation insights. In this study, we investigate how the presence or absence of comments, both during training and at inference time, impacts the bug-fixing capabilities of LLMs. We conduct an empirical evaluation comparing two model families, each evaluated under all combinations of training and inference conditions (with and without comments), and thereby revisiting the common practice of removing comments during training. To address the limited availability of comments in state-of-the-art datasets, we use an LLM to automatically generate comments for methods lacking them. Our findings show that comments improve ABF accuracy by up to threefold when present in both phases, while training with comments does not degrade performance when instances lack them. Additionally, an interpretability analysis identifies that comments detailing method implementation are particularly effective in aiding LLMs to fix bugs accurately.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u767c\u73fe\u7a0b\u5f0f\u78bc\u8a3b\u89e3\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52d5\u4fee\u5fa9\u932f\u8aa4\u80fd\u529b\u9054\u4e09\u500d\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5305\u542b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5be6\u73fe\u7d30\u7bc0\u7684\u8a3b\u89e3\u6700\u6709\u6548", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52d5\u932f\u8aa4\u4fee\u5fa9(ABF)\u901a\u5e38\u6703\u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u524d\u79fb\u9664\u7a0b\u5f0f\u78bc\u8a3b\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u5011\u5047\u8a2d\u8a3b\u89e3\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u50f9\u503c\u7684\u8a2d\u8a08\u548c\u5be6\u73fe\u898b\u89e3\uff0c\u5c0d\u4fee\u5fa9\u67d0\u4e9b\u985e\u578b\u7684\u932f\u8aa4\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981", "method": "\u9032\u884c\u5be6\u8b49\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f03\u5169\u500b\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u548c\u63a8\u8ad6\u968e\u6bb5\u6240\u6709\u7d44\u5408\u689d\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u6709\u7121\u8a3b\u89e3\uff09\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u81ea\u52d5\u70ba\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8a3b\u89e3\u7684\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u8a3b\u89e3", "result": "\u8a3b\u89e3\u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u548c\u63a8\u8ad6\u968e\u6bb5\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u6642\uff0c\u80fd\u5c07ABF\u6e96\u78ba\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9054\u4e09\u500d\uff1b\u8a13\u7df4\u6642\u5305\u542b\u8a3b\u89e3\u4e0d\u6703\u964d\u4f4e\u7121\u8a3b\u89e3\u5be6\u4f8b\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff1b\u5305\u542b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5be6\u73fe\u7d30\u7bc0\u7684\u8a3b\u89e3\u7279\u5225\u6709\u6548", "conclusion": "\u8a3b\u89e3\u5c0dLLM\u7684\u932f\u8aa4\u4fee\u5fa9\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u986f\u8457\u6b63\u9762\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5305\u542b\u5be6\u73fe\u7d30\u7bc0\u7684\u8a3b\u89e3\uff0c\u9019\u6311\u6230\u4e86\u50b3\u7d71\u79fb\u9664\u8a3b\u89e3\u7684\u9810\u8655\u7406\u505a\u6cd5"}}

Existing VR testing approaches enable scene navigation and interaction activation, but lack the ability to automatically synthesise realistic 3D user inputs (e.g, grab and trigger actions via hand-held controllers). Automated testing that generates and executes such input remains an unresolved challenge. Furthermore, existing metrics fail to robustly capture diverse interaction coverage. This paper addresses these gaps through four key contributions. First, we empirically identify four prevalent interaction types in nine open-source VR projects: fire, manipulate, socket, and custom. Second, we introduce the Interaction Flow Graph, a novel abstraction that systematically models 3D user interactions by identifying targets, actions, and conditions. Third, we construct XRBench3D, a benchmark comprising ten VR scenes that encompass 456 distinct user interactions for evaluating VR interaction testing. Finally, we present XRintTest, an automated testing approach that leverages this graph for dynamic scene exploration and interaction execution. Evaluation on XRBench3D shows that XRintTest achieves great effectiveness, reaching 93% coverage of fire, manipulate and socket interactions across all scenes, and performing 12x more effectively and 6x more efficiently than random exploration. Moreover, XRintTest can detect runtime exceptions and non-exception interaction issues, including subtle configuration defects. In addition, the Interaction Flow Graph can reveal potential interaction design smells that may compromise intended functionality and hinder testing performance for VR applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86XRintTest\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u6d41\u56fe\u81ea\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5VR\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VR\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d3D\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "VR\u6280\u672f\u5e26\u6765\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b58\u5728\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709VR\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u771f\u5b9e3D\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u5982\u624b\u67c4\u6293\u53d6\u548c\u89e6\u53d1\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u7a33\u5065\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "1. \u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u67909\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90VR\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u56db\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u4ea4\u4e92\u7c7b\u578b\uff1afire\u3001manipulate\u3001socket\u3001custom\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u4e92\u6d41\u56fe\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a213D\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b3. \u6784\u5efaXRBench3D\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b10\u4e2aVR\u573a\u666f\u548c456\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b4. \u5f00\u53d1XRintTest\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u4e92\u6d41\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728XRBench3D\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cXRintTest\u5bf9fire\u3001manipulate\u548csocket\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u8fbe\u523093%\uff0c\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u534712\u500d\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u53476\u500d\u3002\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u975e\u5f02\u5e38\u4ea4\u4e92\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5fae\u5999\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u4ea4\u4e92\u6d41\u56fe\u8fd8\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u6d41\u56fe\u548cXRintTest\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VR\u4ea4\u4e92\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aVR\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity. These results demonstrate that geometric scale generalization cannot be inferred from accuracy alone.

Although numerous automated microservice decomposition frameworks have been proposed, their evaluation is often fragmented due to inconsistent benchmark systems, incompatible metrics, and limited reproducibility, thus hindering objective comparison. This work presents a unified comparative evaluation of state-of-the-art microservice decomposition approaches spanning static, dynamic, and hybrid techniques. Using a consistent metric computation pipeline, we assess the decomposition quality across widely used benchmark systems (JPetStore, AcmeAir, DayTrader, and Plants) using Structural Modularity (SM), Interface Number(IFN), Inter-partition Communication (ICP), Non-Extreme Distribution (NED), and related indicators. Our analysis combines results reported in prior studies with experimentally reproduced outputs from available replication packages. Findings indicate that the hierarchical clustering-based methods, particularly HDBScan, produce the most consistently balanced decompositions across benchmarks, achieving strong modularity while minimizing communication and interface overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fHDBScan\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u4e00\u81f4\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ece\u5355\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u786e\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u8fb9\u754c\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5ba2\u89c2\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6307\u6807\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5bf9\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u9759\u6001\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6280\u672f\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08JPetStore\u3001AcmeAir\u3001DayTrader\u3001Plants\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5757\u5316(SM)\u3001\u63a5\u53e3\u6570\u91cf(IFN)\u3001\u5206\u533a\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1(ICP)\u3001\u975e\u6781\u7aef\u5206\u5e03(NED)\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u4ece\u53ef\u7528\u590d\u5236\u5305\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fHDBScan\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u4e00\u81f4\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u63a5\u53e3\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fHDBScan\uff09\u5728\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8fc1\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

A growing body of alignment research has shown that models initially deemed \"aligned\" can exhibit misaligned behavior after fine-tuning, such as forgetting jailbreak safety features or re-surfacing knowledge that was intended to be forgotten. These works typically assume that the initial model is aligned based on static black-box evaluation, i.e., the absence of undesired responses to a fixed set of queries. In contrast, we formalize model alignment in both the static and post-update settings and uncover a fundamental limitation of black-box evaluation. We theoretically show that, due to overparameterization, static alignment provides no guarantee of post-update alignment for any update dataset. Moreover, we prove that static black-box probing cannot distinguish a model that is genuinely post-update robust from one that conceals an arbitrary amount of adversarial behavior which can be activated by even a single benign gradient update. We further validate these findings empirically in LLMs across three core alignment domains: privacy, jailbreak safety, and behavioral honesty. We demonstrate the existence of LLMs that pass all standard black-box alignment tests, yet become severely misaligned after a single benign update. Finally, we show that the capacity to hide such latent adversarial behavior increases with model scale, confirming our theoretical prediction that post-update misalignment grows with the number of parameters. Together, our results highlight the inadequacy of static evaluation protocols and emphasize the urgent need for post-update-robust alignment evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9759\u6001\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1LLM\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u826f\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u521d\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2dLLM\u7ecf\u5e38\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u800c\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u884c\u4e3a", "method": "\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u7531\u4e8e\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u8d8a\u72f1\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u8bda\u5b9e\u4e09\u4e2a\u5bf9\u9f50\u9886\u57df\u6d4b\u8bd5LLM", "result": "\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6240\u6709\u6807\u51c6\u9ed1\u76d2\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684LLM\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u826f\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u53d8\u5f97\u4e25\u91cd\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u9690\u85cf\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0", "conclusion": "\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

Temporal Patterns and Predictors of Newcomer-to-Core Transitions in Conventional OSS and OSS4SG", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "Open Source Software (OSS) sustainability relies on newcomers transitioning to core contributors, but this pipeline is broken, with most newcomers becoming inactive after initial contributions. Open Source Software for Social Good (OSS4SG) projects, which prioritize societal impact as their primary mission, may be associated with different newcomer-to-core transition outcomes than conventional OSS projects. We compared 375 projects (190 OSS4SG, 185 OSS), analyzing 92,721 contributors and 3.5 million commits. OSS4SG projects retain contributors at 2.2X higher rates and contributors have 19.6% higher probability of achieving core status. Early broad project exploration predicts core achievement (22.2% importance); conventional OSS concentrates on one dominant pathway (61.62% of transitions) while OSS4SG provides multiple pathways. Contrary to intuition, contributors who invest time learning the project before intensifying their contributions (Late Spike pattern) achieve core status 2.4-2.9X faster (21 weeks) than those who contribute intensively from day one (Early Spike pattern, 51-60 weeks).

We prove that PA-GP-UCB preserves the standard regret rate of GP-UCB while achieving a strictly smaller leading constant that is explicitly controlled by prediction quality and offline data coverage. Empirically, PA-GP-UCB converges faster than Vanilla GP-UCB and naive prediction-augmented GP-UCB baselines on synthetic benchmarks and on a real-world hypothesis evaluation task grounded in human behavioral data, where predictions are provided by large language models.

Prior work addresses this challenge using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks based on semantic indexing or structure-aware graph analysis, but these approaches incur substantial computational overhead for index construction and maintenance. Motivated by common developer workflows that rely on lightweight search utilities (e.g., ripgrep), we revisit a fundamental yet underexplored question: how far can simple, index-free lexical retrieval support repository-level code completion before more complex retrieval mechanisms become necessary? To answer this question, we systematically investigate lightweight, index-free, intent-aware lexical retrieval through extensive empirical analysis. We first introduce Naive GrepRAG, a baseline framework in which LLMs autonomously generate ripgrep commands to retrieve relevant context. Despite its simplicity, Naive GrepRAG achieves performance comparable to sophisticated graph-based baselines. Further analysis shows that its effectiveness stems from retrieving lexically precise code fragments that are spatially closer to the completion site. We also identify key limitations of lexical retrieval, including sensitivity to noisy matches from high-frequency ambiguous keywords and context fragmentation caused by rigid truncation boundaries. To address these issues, we propose GrepRAG, which augments lexical retrieval with a lightweight post-processing pipeline featuring identifier-weighted re-ranking and structure-aware deduplication. Extensive evaluation on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated demonstrates that GrepRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving 7.04-15.58 percent relative improvement in code exact match (EM) over the best baseline on CrossCodeEval.", "AI": {"tldr": "GrepRAG\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bcd\u6cd5\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ripgrep\u547d\u4ee4\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7d22\u5f15\u6216\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e38\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u641c\u7d22\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982ripgrep\uff09\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u65e0\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u8bcd\u6cd5\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51faNaive GrepRAG\u57fa\u7ebf\u6846\u67b6\uff1aLLM\u81ea\u4e3b\u751f\u6210ripgrep\u547d\u4ee4\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b2. \u6539\u8fdb\u4e3aGrepRAG\uff1a\u589e\u52a0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u52a0\u6743\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u91cd\u3002", "result": "Naive GrepRAG\u6027\u80fd\u5df2\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff1bGrepRAG\u5728CrossCodeEval\u548cRepoEval-Updated\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728CrossCodeEval\u4e0a\u4ee3\u7801\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u53477.04-15.58%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u65e0\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u8bcd\u6cd5\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0cGrepRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bcd\u6cd5\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We introduce FlowSymm, a novel architecture that combines (i) a group-action on divergence-free flows, (ii) a graph-attention encoder to learn feature-conditioned weights over these symmetry-preserving actions, and (iii) a lightweight Tikhonov refinement solved via implicit bilevel optimization. The method first anchors the given observation on a minimum-norm divergence-free completion. We then compute an orthonormal basis for all admissible group actions that leave the observed flows invariant and parameterize the valid solution subspace, which shows an Abelian group structure under vector addition. A stack of GATv2 layers then encodes the graph and its edge features into per-edge embeddings, which are pooled over the missing edges and produce per-basis attention weights.

Despite this, many LLM-based repair pipelines still operate in a reset-and-solve manner, producing fresh reasoning for every new issue instead of carrying forward what worked in past fixes. This is wasteful because repositories routinely contain earlier issues with overlapping structure, failure modes, or constraints, where prior repair experience could provide useful guidance. Existing approaches typically harvest this signal through forward-time trial procedures, such as repeated refinement or search, incurring high inference cost while still risking divergence from the eventual correct patch. We present an Outcome-Conditioned Reasoning Distillation(O-CRD) framework that uses resolved in-repository issues with verified patches as supervision. Starting from a historical fix, the method reconstructs a stage-wise repair trace backward from the verified outcome, then reuses the distilled guidance at inference time to steer file/function localization and patch synthesis, without fine-tuning or online search.

Since models vary widely in capability and price, routing queries to models that balance quality and inference cost is essential. Existing router approaches assume access to centralized query-model evaluation data. However, these data are often fragmented across clients, such as end users and organizations, and are privacy-sensitive, which makes centralizing data infeasible. Additionally, per-client router training is ineffective since local evaluation data is limited and covers only a restricted query distribution and a biased subset of model evaluations. We introduce the first federated framework for LLM routing, enabling clients to learn a shared routing policy from local offline query-model evaluation data. Our framework supports both parametric multilayer perceptron router and nonparametric K-means router under heterogeneous client query distributions and non-uniform model coverage. Across two benchmarks, federated collaboration improves the accuracy-cost frontier over client-local routers, both via increased effective model coverage and better query generalization. Our theoretical results also validate that federated training reduces routing suboptimality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u8def\u7531\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f7f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u80fd\u4ece\u672c\u5730\u79bb\u7ebf\u67e5\u8be2-\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u4eab\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6709\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u7684\u67e5\u8be2-\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u5728\u5404\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e14\u6d89\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5355\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u5e03\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u7f6e\u800c\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9996\u4e2a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u8def\u7531\u5668\u548c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5316K-means\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u534f\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u8def\u7531\u5668\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u8def\u7531\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u8def\u7531\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u4eab\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8def\u7531\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

SPARK also allows instructors to inspect intermediate outputs, providing deeper insights into solution variations. We also construct a dataset of 40-minute keystroke coding data from N=22 learners solving two web programming exercises and provide empirical insights into the perceived usefulness of SPARK through a within-subjects evaluation with 16 programming instructors.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPARK\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f16\u7a0b\u7ec3\u4e60\u76d1\u63a7\u4eea\u8868\u677f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5b50\u6b65\u9aa4\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5efa\u8bae\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8fdb\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u6559\u5e08\u76d1\u63a7\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7f16\u7a0b\u7ec3\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u76d1\u63a7\u8bfe\u5802\u7f16\u7a0b\u7ec3\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u6559\u5e08\u8bc6\u522b\u56f0\u96be\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u5e38\u89c1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u3001\u590d\u6742\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u65e0\u56fa\u5b9a\u5b8c\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\u6216\u96be\u4ee5\u603b\u7ed3\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7f16\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u6784\u5efa\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fWeb\u754c\u9762\uff09\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u5c55\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "SPARK\u5141\u8bb8\u6559\u5e08\u6839\u636e\u7ec3\u4e60\u8981\u6c42\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u5c06\u5b50\u6b65\u9aa4\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5efa\u8bae\u81ea\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8de8\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u8fdb\u5ea6\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u5141\u8bb8\u6559\u5e08\u68c0\u67e5\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b22\u540d\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u4e2aWeb\u7f16\u7a0b\u7ec3\u4e60\u768440\u5206\u949f\u51fb\u952e\u7f16\u7801\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc716\u540d\u7f16\u7a0b\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u5185\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86SPARK\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "SPARK\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u7ec3\u4e60\u76d1\u63a7\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u6559\u5e08\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u3001\u590d\u6742\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684Web\u7f16\u7a0b\u7ec3\u4e60\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Recent graph-based models leverage spatial relationships between Wire-less Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Access Points (APs) and devices, offering finer localization granularity, but fall short in quantifying prediction uncertainty, a key requirement for real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Graph Transformer (SAC-GT), a framework for accurate and reliable indoor localization. SAC-GT integrates a Graph Transformer (GT) model that captures network's spatial topology and signal strength dynamics, with a novel Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Prediction (SACP) method that provides region-specific uncertainty estimates. This allows SAC-GT to produce not only precise two-dimensional (2D) location predictions but also statistically valid confidence regions tailored to varying environmental conditions. Extensive evaluations on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed SAC-GT solution achieves state-of-the-art localization accuracy while delivering robust and spatially adaptive reliability guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSAC-GT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u670d\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u662f\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAC-GT\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668(GT)\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6355\u6349Wi-Fi\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u4e0e\u8bbe\u5907\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\uff1b2) \u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b(SACP)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u533a\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAC-GT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "SAC-GT\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7cbe\u786e\u76842D\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

The research combines large language models (LLMs) with multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) theory to develop the LLM-TOPSIS framework. In this context, we utilized the TOPSIS method enhanced by fuzzy logic (Fuzzy TOPSIS) to address the intrinsic ambiguity and subjectivity in human assessments. We utilized triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) to describe criteria weights and scores, thereby addressing the ambiguity frequently encountered in candidate evaluations. For candidate ranking, the DistilRoBERTa model was fine-tuned and integrated with the fuzzy TOPSIS method, achieving rankings closely aligned with human expert evaluations and attaining an accuracy of up to 91% for the Experience attribute and the Overall attribute. The study underlines the potential of NLP-driven frameworks to improve recruitment procedures by boosting scalability, consistency, and minimizing prejudice.

By sending easy queries to cheaper models and hard queries to stronger ones, it can significantly reduce inference cost while maintaining high accuracy. However, most existing routers treat this as a fixed choice among a small set of models, which makes them hard to adapt to new models or changing budget constraints. In this paper, we propose SCOPE (Scalable and Controllable Outcome Performance Estimator), a routing framework that goes beyond model selection by predicting their cost and performance. Trained with reinforcement learning, SCOPE makes reasoning-based predictions by retrieving how models behave on similar problems, rather than relying on fixed model names, enabling it to work with new, unseen models. Moreover, by explicitly predicting how accurate and how expensive a model will be, it turns routing into a dynamic decision problem, allowing users to easily control the trade-off between accuracy and cost.

However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect a genuine understanding of vulnerability root causes or merely an exploitation of functional patterns. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed the \"semantic trap,\" where fine-tuned LLMs achieve high detection scores by associating certain functional domains with vulnerability likelihood rather than reasoning about the underlying security semantics.To systematically evaluate this phenomenon, we propose TrapEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to disentangle vulnerability root cause from functional pattern. TrapEval introduces two complementary datasets derived from real-world open-source projects: V2N, which pairs vulnerable code with unrelated benign code, and V2P, which pairs vulnerable code with its corresponding patched version, forcing models to distinguish near-identical code that differs only in subtle security-critical logic. Using TrapEval, we fine-tune five representative state-of-the-art LLMs across three model families and evaluate them under cross-dataset testing, semantic-preserving perturbations, and varying degrees of semantic gap measured by CodeBLEU.Our empirical results reveal that, despite improvements in metrics, fine-tuned LLMs consistently struggle to distinguish vulnerable code from its patched counterpart, exhibit severe robustness degradation under minor semantic-preserving transformations, and rely heavily on functional-context shortcuts when the semantic gap is small. These findings provide strong evidence that current fine-tuning practices often fail to impart true vulnerability reasoning. Our findings serve as a wake-up call: high benchmark scores on traditional datasets may be illusory, masking the model's inability to understand the true causal logic of vulnerabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684LLMs\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u5b89\u5168\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\"\u8bed\u4e49\u9677\u9631\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u6570\u5177\u6709\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684LLMs\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7a76LLMs\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u5b89\u5168\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTrapEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1aV2N\uff08\u5c06\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u65e0\u5173\u826f\u6027\u4ee3\u7801\u914d\u5bf9\uff09\u548cV2P\uff08\u5c06\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u5176\u4fee\u8865\u7248\u672c\u914d\u5bf9\uff09\u3002\u5fae\u8c035\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027LLMs\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\u6270\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528CodeBLEU\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684LLMs\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u5176\u4fee\u8865\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u8f7b\u5fae\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5f53\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u8ddd\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u529f\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6377\u5f84\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6307\u6807\u6709\u6240\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u8df5\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f20\u6388\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u865a\u5e7b\u7684\uff0c\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u7406\u89e3\u6f0f\u6d1e\u771f\u6b63\u56e0\u679c\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u6572\u54cd\u4e86\u8b66\u949f\u3002"}}

While machine-learning models achieve strong performance, many fail to translate into routine clinical use due to misalignment with workflow constraints such as memorability, auditability, and bedside execution. We argue that this gap arises not from insufficient predictive power, but from optimizing over model classes that are incompatible with guideline deployment. Deployable guidelines often take the form of unit-weighted clinical checklists, formed by thresholding the sum of binary rules, but learning such scores requires searching an exponentially large discrete space of possible rule sets. We introduce AgentScore, which performs semantically guided optimization in this space by using LLMs to propose candidate rules and a deterministic, data-grounded verification-and-selection loop to enforce statistical validity and deployability constraints. Across eight clinical prediction tasks, AgentScore outperforms existing score-generation methods and achieves AUC comparable to more flexible interpretable models despite operating under stronger structural constraints.

Existing benchmarks often fall short by relying on synthetic vulnerabilities or evaluating functional correctness in isolation, failing to capture the complex interplay between functionality and security found in real-world software. To address this gap, we introduce RealSec-bench, a new benchmark for secure code generation meticulously constructed from real-world, high-risk Java repositories. Our methodology employs a multi-stage pipeline that combines systematic SAST scanning with CodeQL, LLM-based false positive elimination, and rigorous human expert validation. The resulting benchmark contains 105 instances grounded in real-word repository contexts, spanning 19 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types and exhibiting a wide diversity of data flow complexities, including vulnerabilities with up to 34-hop inter-procedural dependencies. Using RealSec-bench, we conduct an extensive empirical study on 5 popular LLMs. We introduce a novel composite metric, SecurePass@K, to assess both functional correctness and security simultaneously. We find that while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques can improve functional correctness, they provide negligible benefits to security. Furthermore, explicitly prompting models with general security guidelines often leads to compilation failures, harming functional correctness without reliably preventing vulnerabilities.

We propose a general framework based on Stratified Importance Sampling (SIS) that directly addresses these constraints in model monitoring. While SIS has previously been applied in specialized domains, our theoretical analysis establishes its broad applicability to the monitoring of classification models. Under mild conditions, SIS yields unbiased estimators with strict finite-sample mean squared error (MSE) improvements over both importance sampling (IS) and stratified random sampling (SRS). The framework does not rely on optimally defined proposal distributions or strata: even with noisy proxies and sub-optimal stratification, SIS can improve estimator efficiency compared to IS or SRS individually, though extreme proposal mismatch may limit these gains. Experiments across binary and multiclass tasks demonstrate consistent efficiency improvements under fixed label budgets, underscoring SIS as a principled, label-efficient, and operationally lightweight methodology for post-deployment model monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837(SIS)\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u7b97\u4e25\u683c\u3001\u6279\u91cf\u83b7\u53d6\u6807\u7b7e\u4e14\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u76d1\u63a7\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u76d1\u63a7\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u3001\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6279\u91cf\u83b7\u53d6\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837(SIS)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u63d0\u8bae\u5206\u5e03\u6216\u5206\u5c42\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cSIS\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837(IS)\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837(SRS)\u5177\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u4e8c\u5143\u548c\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "SIS\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u76d1\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u5219\u6027\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Most existing approaches adopt a discrete pipeline: molecules are encoded as sequences, graphs, or point clouds, mapped to fixed-dimensional embeddings, and then used for task-specific prediction. This paradigm treats molecules as discrete objects, despite their intrinsically continuous and field-like physical nature. We argue that molecular learning can instead be formulated as learning in function space. Specifically, we model each molecule as a continuous function over three-dimensional (3D) space and treat this molecular field as the primary object of representation. From this perspective, conventional molecular representations arise as particular sampling schemes of an underlying continuous object. We instantiate this formulation with MolField, a hyper-network-based framework that learns distributions over molecular fields. To ensure physical consistency, these functions are defined over canonicalized coordinates, yielding invariance to global SE(3) transformations. To enable learning directly over functions, we introduce a structured weight tokenization and train a sequence-based hyper-network to model a shared prior over molecular fields. We evaluate MolField on molecular dynamics and property prediction.

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by optimizing models through execution-driven rewards without labeled supervision, our preliminary results show that naive RL with only functionality rewards fails to generate effective unit tests for difficult branches and samples. We first theoretically analyze showing that branch coverage, sample difficulty, syntactic and functional correctness can be jointly modeled as RL rewards, where optimizing these signals can improve the reliability of unit-test-based verification. Guided by this analysis, we design syntax- and functionality-aware rewards and further propose branch- and sample-difficulty--aware RL using exponential reward shaping and static analysis metrics.

At scale, however, Cell Painting data is strongly affected by batch effects arising from differences in laboratories, instruments, and protocols, which can obscure biological signal. We present BALANS (Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling), a scalable batch-correction method that aligns samples across batches by constructing a smoothed affinity matrix from pairwise distances. Given $n$ data points, BALANS builds a sparse affinity matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ using two ideas. (i) For points $i$ and $j$, it sets a local scale using the distance from $i$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor within the batch of $j$, then computes $A_{ij}$ via a Gaussian kernel calibrated by these batch-aware local scales.

This setting complicates assurance, because behavior depends on nondeterministic environments and probabilistic model outputs. Prior work introduced runtime verification for agentic AI via Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance (DPA), learning an MDP online and model checking quantitative properties. A key limitation is that developers must manually define the state abstraction, which couples verification to application-specific heuristics and increases adoption friction. This paper proposes TriCEGAR, a trace-driven abstraction mechanism that automates state construction from execution logs and supports online construction of an agent behavioral MDP. TriCEGAR represents abstractions as predicate trees learned from traces and refined using counterexamples. We describe a framework-native implementation that (i) captures typed agent lifecycle events, (ii) builds abstractions from traces, (iii) constructs an MDP, and (iv) performs probabilistic model checking to compute bounds such as Pmax(success) and Pmin(failure).

Several recent extensions improve its accuracy by introducing correlated noise across training iterations. Matrix factorization mechanisms are a prominent example, but they correlate noise across many iterations and require storing previously added noise vectors, leading to substantial memory overhead in some settings. In this work, we propose a new noise correlation strategy that correlates noise only with the immediately preceding iteration and cancels a controlled portion of it. Our method relies on noise regeneration using a pseudorandom noise generator, eliminating the need to store past noise. As a result, it requires no additional memory beyond standard DP-SGD.

Our two-phase protocol first builds a category-balanced conversation corpus via PAIR-style iterative prompt refinement over API, then has trained human agents replay/refine those prompts in the consumer UI using a designated child account while monitoring the linked parent inbox for alerts. We focus on seven risk areas -- physical harm, pornography, privacy violence, health consultation, fraud, hate speech, and malware and quantify four outcomes: Notification Rate (NR), Leak-Through (LR), Overblocking (OBR), and UI Intervention Rate (UIR). Using an automated judge (with targeted human audit) and comparing the current backend to legacy variants (GPT-4.1/4o), we find that notifications are selective rather than comprehensive: privacy violence, fraud, hate speech, and malware triggered no parental alerts in our runs, whereas physical harm (highest), pornography, and some health queries produced intermittent alerts. The current backend shows lower leak-through than legacy models, yet overblocking of benign, educational queries near sensitive topics remains common and is not surfaced to parents, revealing a policy-product gap between on-screen safeguards and parent-facing telemetry. We propose actionable fixes: broaden/configure the notification taxonomy, couple visible safeguards to privacy-preserving parent summaries, and prefer calibrated, age-appropriate safe rewrites over blanket refusals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u6d41\u5bf9\u8bdd\u52a9\u624b\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea7\u5bb6\u957f\u63a7\u5236\u5bf9\u672a\u6210\u5e74\u4eba\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u800c\u975e\u5168\u9762\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u4ea7\u54c1\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea7\u5bb6\u957f\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u5bf9\u8bdd\u52a9\u624b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u672a\u6210\u5e74\u4eba\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u73b0\u6709\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bb6\u957f\u901a\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u53d1\u6325\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u8bae\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7PAIR\u5f0f\u8fed\u4ee3\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u7c7b\u522b\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7531\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u7d20\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u8005UI\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u6307\u5b9a\u513f\u7ae5\u8d26\u6237\u91cd\u64ad/\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u94fe\u63a5\u7684\u5bb6\u957f\u6536\u4ef6\u7bb1\u83b7\u53d6\u8b66\u62a5\u3002\u805a\u7126\u4e03\u4e2a\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u56db\u4e2a\u7ed3\u679c\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u6027\uff1a\u9690\u79c1\u66b4\u529b\u3001\u6b3a\u8bc8\u3001\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u548c\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u672a\u89e6\u53d1\u5bb6\u957f\u8b66\u62a5\uff0c\u800c\u7269\u7406\u4f24\u5bb3\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\uff09\u3001\u8272\u60c5\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u5065\u5eb7\u67e5\u8be2\u4ea7\u751f\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u8b66\u62a5\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u540e\u7aef\u6bd4\u65e7\u7248\u6a21\u578b\u6cc4\u6f0f\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u654f\u611f\u8bdd\u9898\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u826f\u6027\u6559\u80b2\u67e5\u8be2\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5c4f\u853d\u4ecd\u7136\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5411\u5bb6\u957f\u5c55\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea7\u5bb6\u957f\u63a7\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u4ea7\u54c1\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u9762\u5411\u5bb6\u957f\u7684\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u6269\u5c55/\u914d\u7f6e\u901a\u77e5\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u89c1\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5bb6\u957f\u6458\u8981\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5148\u91c7\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u3001\u9002\u5408\u5e74\u9f84\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u91cd\u5199\u800c\u975e\u5168\u9762\u62d2\u7edd\u3002"}}

Many practical settings, however, allow only pairwise comparison queries, yielding a preferential BO problem where direct function evaluations are unavailable. Extending the knowledge gradient to preferential BO is hindered by its computational challenge. At its core, the look-ahead step in the preferential setting requires computing a non-Gaussian posterior, which was previously considered intractable. In this paper, we address this challenge by deriving an exact and analytical knowledge gradient for preferential BO. We show that the exact knowledge gradient performs strongly on a suite of benchmark problems, often outperforming existing acquisition functions.

However, conventional supply chain optimization models often overlook crucial sustainability goals and cyber vulnerabilities, leaving systems susceptible to both ecological harm and malicious attacks. To tackle these challenges simultaneously, this work integrates a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that unifies carbon footprint reduction, inventory management, and cryptographic-like security measures. We design a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that couples a controllable spin-chain analogy with real-time AIoT signals and optimizes a multi-objective reward unifying fidelity, security, and carbon costs. The approach learns robust policies with stabilized training via value-based and ensemble updates, supported by window-normalized reward components to ensure commensurate scaling. In simulation, the method exhibits smooth convergence, strong late-episode performance, and graceful degradation under representative noise channels, outperforming standard learned and model-based references, highlighting its robust handling of real-time sustainability and risk demands.

Finally, we study two lightweight interventions: splitting a fixed budget into parallel executions, which surprisingly improves performance despite a no-gain theoretical result for our tasks, and periodically summarizing the interaction history, which preserves key discoveries and further improves exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4ea4\u4e92\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63a2\u7d22\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5e38\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4ea4\u4e92\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u96be\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6db5\u76d6\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u73af\u5883\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7b80\u5355\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\uff1a\u5c06\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9a\u671f\u603b\u7ed3\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5e38\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u9884\u7b97\u589e\u52a0\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5f31\u3002\u5e76\u884c\u5206\u5272\u9884\u7b97\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u65e0\u589e\u76ca\uff09\uff0c\u5b9a\u671f\u603b\u7ed3\u5386\u53f2\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u5584\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4ea4\u4e92\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\u5982\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u5272\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u603b\u7ed3\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While this reduces the overhead of full-vector rotations, the effect of block structure on outlier suppression remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we present the first systematic, non-asymptotic analysis of outlier suppression for block Hadamard rotations. Our analysis reveals that outlier suppression is fundamentally limited by the geometry of the input vector. In particular, post-rotation outliers are deterministically minimized when the pre-rotation $\\ell_1$ norm mass is evenly distributed across blocks. Guided by these insights, we introduce MixQuant, a block rotation-aware PTQ framework that redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation. We propose a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to calibrate permutations by equalizing the expected blockwise $\\ell_1$ norms. To avoid adding inference overhead, we identify permutation-equivariant regions in transformer architectures to merge the resulting permutations into model weights before deployment. Experiments show that MixQuant consistently improves accuracy across all block sizes, recovering up to 90% of the full-vector rotation perplexity when quantizing Llama3 1B to INT4 with block size 16, compared to 46% without permutations.", "AI": {"tldr": "MixQuant\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5757\u65cb\u8f6c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6392\u5217\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u5728Llama3 1B INT4\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u6062\u590d90%\u5168\u5411\u91cf\u65cb\u8f6c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5757\u65cb\u8f6c\u6765\u6269\u6563\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5757\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6291\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5757Hadamard\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6291\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1. \u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u5757Hadamard\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6291\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u6790\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51faMixQuant\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6392\u5217\u5728\u65cb\u8f6c\u524d\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b3. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d2a\u5fc3\u8d28\u91cf\u6269\u6563\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5747\u8861\u671f\u671b\u5757\u7ea7\u2113\u2081\u8303\u6570\u6765\u6821\u51c6\u6392\u5217\uff1b4. \u8bc6\u522bTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u6392\u5217\u7b49\u53d8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5c06\u6392\u5217\u5408\u5e76\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u4e2d\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "MixQuant\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u5c06Llama3 1B\u91cf\u5316\u4e3aINT4\u3001\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a16\u65f6\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4e8690%\u7684\u5168\u5411\u91cf\u65cb\u8f6c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u6392\u5217\u768446%\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6291\u5236\u53d7\u8f93\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5f53\u9884\u65cb\u8f6c\u2113\u2081\u8303\u6570\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u5757\u95f4\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u540e\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u88ab\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3002MixQuant\u901a\u8fc7\u6392\u5217\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5757\u65cb\u8f6c\u91cf\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We present a predictive theory that resolves this gap by showing that recoverability follows a measurable law. To elaborate, we formalize recoverability through Expected Recovery Regret (ERR), which quantifies the deviation of a recovery policy from the optimal one under stochastic execution noise, and derive a first-order relationship between ERR and an empirical observable quantity, the Efficiency Score (ES). This yields a falsifiable first-order quantitative law of recovery dynamics in tool-using agents. We empirically validate the law across five tool-use benchmarks spanning controlled perturbations, diagnostic reasoning, and real-world APIs. Across model scales, perturbation regimes, and recovery horizons, predicted regret under the ERR-ES law closely matched observed post-failure regret measured from Monte Carlo rollouts, within delta less than or equal to 0.05.

By exploiting the cone geometry of the relative translation invariant quadratic Wasserstein space, we introduce two novel geometric quantities, the relative Wasserstein angle and the orthogonal projection distance, which provide meaningful measures of non-Gaussianity. We prove that the filling cone generated by any two rays in this space is flat, ensuring that angles, projections, and inner products are rigorously well-defined. This geometric viewpoint recasts Gaussian approximation as a projection problem onto the Gaussian cone and reveals that the commonly used moment-matching Gaussian can \\emph{not} be the \\(W_2\\)-nearest Gaussian for a given empirical distribution. In one dimension, we derive closed-form expressions for the proposed quantities and extend them to several classical distribution families, including uniform, Laplace, and logistic distributions; while in high dimensions, we develop an efficient stochastic manifold optimization algorithm based on a semi-discrete dual formulation. Experiments on synthetic data and real-world feature distributions demonstrate that the relative Wasserstein angle is more robust than the Wasserstein distance and that the proposed nearest Gaussian provides a better approximation than moment matching in the evaluation of Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u4e8c\u6b21Wasserstein\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9525\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u5bf9Wasserstein\u89d2\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u586b\u5145\u9525\u662f\u5e73\u5766\u7684\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u662fWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8861\u91cf\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u4e8c\u6b21Wasserstein\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9525\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u91cf\uff1a\u76f8\u5bf9Wasserstein\u89d2\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u79bb\u6563\u5bf9\u5076\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4efb\u610f\u4e24\u6761\u5c04\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u586b\u5145\u9525\u662f\u5e73\u5766\u7684\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u89d2\u5ea6\u3001\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u5185\u79ef\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u5bf9Wasserstein\u89d2\u6bd4Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u5728FID\u8bc4\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u6bd4\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u9ad8\u65af\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9Wasserstein\u89d2\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

We formalize this setting as poset-structured safety, modeling safety constraints as a partially ordered set and treating safety composition as a structural property of the policy class. Building on this formulation, we propose PoSafeNet, a differentiable neural safety layer that enforces safety via sequential closed-form projection under poset-consistent constraint orderings, enabling adaptive selection or mixing of valid safety executions while preserving priority semantics by construction.

In this paper, we quantify the energy cost of seemingly innocuous messages such as ``thank you'' when interacting with large language models, often used by users to convey politeness. Using real-world conversation traces and fine-grained energy measurements, we quantify how input length, output length and model size affect energy use.

While existing methods certify unlearning via statistical indistinguishability from re-trained models, these guarantees do not naturally extend to model outputs when inputs are adversarially perturbed. In particular, slight perturbations of forget samples may still be correctly recognized by the unlearned model - even when a re-trained model fails to do so - revealing a novel privacy risk: information about the forget samples may persist in their local neighborhood. In this work, we formalize this vulnerability as residual knowledge and show that it is inevitable in high-dimensional settings. To mitigate this risk, we propose a fine-tuning strategy, named RURK, that penalizes the model's ability to re-recognize perturbed forget samples. Experiments on vision benchmarks with deep neural networks demonstrate that residual knowledge is prevalent across existing unlearning methods and that our approach effectively prevents residual knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u4e2d\u7684\u6b8b\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5373\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u4ecd\u53ef\u88ab\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faRURK\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0d\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8f7b\u5fae\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u800c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5374\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff1a\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u5176\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRURK\uff08Residual Knowledge Reduction\uff09\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc6\u522b\u6270\u52a8\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6b8b\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6b8b\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u800cRURK\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6b8b\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6b8b\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u578b\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8be5\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684RURK\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

While prior work has examined the energy cost of inference per prompt or per token, we highlight how \\emph{system-level design choices} - such as numerical precision, batching strategy, and request scheduling - can lead to orders-of-magnitude differences in energy consumption for the same model. We perform a detailed empirical study of LLM inference energy and latency on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, analyzing the impact of quantization, batch size, and serving configuration (e.g., with Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference server). Our results reveal that lower-precision formats only yield energy gains in compute-bound regimes; that batching improves energy efficiency, especially in memory-bound phases like decoding; and that structured request timing (arrival shaping) can reduce per-request energy by up to 100 times. We argue that sustainable LLM deployment depends not only on model internals, but also on the orchestration of the serving stack.

We introduce FIRE, a training-free MF framework that couples tabular foundation models (TFMs) to perform zero-shot in-context Bayesian inference via a high-fidelity correction model conditioned on the low-fidelity model's posterior predictive distributions.

Existing methods rely mainly on raw structural data and struggle to exploit the rich scientific literature. While large language models (LLMs) have been added to these pipelines, they have been confined to narrow roles within structure-centered optimizers. We instead cast biological black-box optimization as a fully agentic, language-based reasoning process. We introduce Purely Agentic BLack-box Optimization (PABLO), a hierarchical agentic system that uses scientific LLMs pretrained on chemistry and biology literature to generate and iteratively refine biological candidates. On both the standard GuacaMol molecular design and antimicrobial peptide optimization tasks, PABLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially improving sample efficiency and final objective values over established baselines. Compared to prior optimization methods that incorporate LLMs, PABLO achieves competitive token usage per run despite relying on LLMs throughout the optimization loop. Beyond raw performance, the agentic formulation offers key advantages for realistic design: it naturally incorporates semantic task descriptions, retrieval-augmented domain knowledge, and complex constraints. In follow-up in vitro validation, PABLO-optimized peptides showed strong activity against drug-resistant pathogens, underscoring the practical potential of PABLO for therapeutic discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "PABLO\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7eaf\u4ee3\u7406\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6297\u83cc\u80bd\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u539f\u59cb\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u88ab\u5f15\u5165\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u72ed\u7a84\u89d2\u8272", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPABLO\uff08\u7eaf\u4ee3\u7406\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u79d1\u5b66LLM\u6765\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u7269\u5019\u9009\u7269\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u7269\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u5b8c\u5168\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b", "result": "\u5728GuacaMol\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6297\u83cc\u80bd\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u3002\u5728\u4f53\u5916\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff0cPABLO\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u80bd\u5bf9\u8010\u836f\u75c5\u539f\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6d3b\u6027", "conclusion": "PABLO\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u4f18\u52bf\uff1a\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6f5c\u529b"}}

Despite this ubiquity, graph structure is typically learned in a modality- and task-isolated manner, where graph representations are constructed within individual task contexts and discarded thereafter. As a result, structural regularities across modalities and tasks are repeatedly reconstructed rather than accumulated at the level of intermediate graph representations. This motivates a representation-learning question: how should graph structure be organized so that it can persist and accumulate across heterogeneous modalities and tasks? We adopt a representation-centric perspective in which graph structure is treated as a structural substrate that persists across learning contexts. To instantiate this perspective, we propose G-Substrate, a graph substrate framework that organizes learning around shared graph structures. G-Substrate comprises two complementary mechanisms: a unified structural schema that ensures compatibility among graph representations across heterogeneous modalities and tasks, and an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning. Experiments across multiple domains, modalities, and tasks show that G-Substrate outperforms task-isolated and naive multi-task learning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "G-Substrate\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u4ea4\u66ff\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u79ef\u7d2f", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u4efb\u52a1\u90fd\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u89c4\u5f8b\u65e0\u6cd5\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u8ba9\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u5e76\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faG-Substrate\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u89d2\u8272\u4ea4\u66ff\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8ba9\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u66b4\u9732\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cG-Substrate\u4f18\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5b64\u7acb\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6734\u7d20\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u89c6\u4e3a\u8de8\u5b66\u4e60\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u5e95\uff0cG-Substrate\u80fd\u591f\u79ef\u7d2f\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches based on heuristics or counterfactual reasoning often struggle under uncertainty and high-dimensional dependencies. We introduce SIREN, a novel and scalable method that attributes the root causes of outliers by estimating the score functions of the data likelihood. Attribution is computed via integrated gradients that accumulate score contributions along paths from the outlier toward the normal data distribution. Our method satisfies three of the four classic Shapley value axioms - dummy, efficiency, and linearity - as well as an asymmetry axiom derived from the underlying causal structure. Unlike prior work, SIREN operates directly on the score function, enabling tractable and uncertainty-aware root cause attribution in nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heteroscedastic causal models.

In this paper, we analyze gradient descent (GD) for training two-layer KANs and derive general bounds that characterize their training dynamics, generalization, and utility under differential privacy (DP). As a concrete instantiation, we specialize our analysis to logistic loss under an NTK-separable assumption, where we show that polylogarithmic network width suffices for GD to achieve an optimization rate of order $1/T$ and a generalization rate of order $1/n$, with $T$ denoting the number of GD iterations and $n$ the sample size. In the private setting, we characterize the noise required for $(\u03b5,\u03b4)$-DP and obtain a utility bound of order $\\sqrt{d}/(n\u03b5)$ (with $d$ the input dimension), matching the classical lower bound for general convex Lipschitz problems. Our results imply that polylogarithmic width is not only sufficient but also necessary under differential privacy, revealing a qualitative gap between non-private (sufficiency only) and private (necessity also emerges) training regimes.

This enriched structure makes MetaLead a powerful resource for more transparent and nuanced evaluations across ML research.", "AI": {"tldr": "MetaLead\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6392\u884c\u699c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b83\u6355\u83b7\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u679c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5305\u542b\u989d\u5916\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5982\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u548c\u660e\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3/\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u548c\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684ML\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6392\u884c\u699c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8fdb\u5c55\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u521b\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6392\u884c\u699c\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u53ea\u6355\u83b7\u6bcf\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u4e14\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u900f\u660e\u548c\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMetaLead\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684ML\u6392\u884c\u699c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5b83\u6355\u83b7\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u5982\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u53d8\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "MetaLead\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u548c\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7c7b\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u7ebfvs\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5vs\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5176\u4e30\u5bcc\u7ed3\u6784\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3aML\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "MetaLead\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u83b7\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u5305\u542b\u989d\u5916\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6392\u884c\u699c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u3001\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7c7b\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Diffusion models are widely used as priors for inverse problems, but standard approaches usually assume a high-fidelity model trained on data that closely match the unknown signal. In practice, one often must use a mismatched or low-fidelity diffusion prior. Surprisingly, these weak priors often perform nearly as well as full-strength, in-domain baselines. We study when and why inverse solvers are robust to weak diffusion priors. Through extensive experiments, we find that weak priors succeed when measurements are highly informative (e.g., many observed pixels), and we identify regimes where they fail. Our theory, based on Bayesian consistency, gives conditions under which high-dimensional measurements make the posterior concentrate near the true signal.

As forecasting is probabilistic, developing and evaluating AI forecasters requires generating large numbers of diverse and difficult questions, and accurately resolving them. Previous efforts to automate this laborious work relied on recurring data sources (e.g., weather, stocks), limiting diversity and utility. In this work, we present a system for generating and resolving high-quality forecasting questions automatically and at scale using LLM-powered web research agents. We use this system to generate 1499 diverse, real-world forecasting questions, and to resolve them several months later. We estimate that our system produces verifiable, unambiguous questions approximately 96% of the time, exceeding the rate of Metaculus, a leading human-curated forecasting platform. We also find that our system resolves questions at approximately 95% accuracy. We verify that forecasting agents powered by more intelligent LLMs perform better on these questions (Brier score of 0.134 for Gemini 3 Pro, 0.149 for GPT-5, and 0.179 for Gemini 2.5 Flash). Finally, we demonstrate how our system can be leveraged to directly improve forecasting, by evaluating a question decomposition strategy on a generated question set, yielding a significant improvement in Brier scores (0.132 vs. 0.141).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7f51\u7edc\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u5e73\u53f0", "motivation": "\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u8861\u91cf\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u590d\u6570\u636e\u6e90\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u4e861499\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u65e0\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7ea696%\uff08\u8d85\u8fc7Metaculus\u5e73\u53f0\uff09\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea695%\uff0c\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684LLM\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\uff08Gemini 3 Pro Brier\u5f97\u52060.134\uff09\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff080.132 vs 0.141\uff09", "conclusion": "LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c"}}

In practice, prompt pools are often static or only loosely tied to the model's learning progress, so uniform sampling can't keep up with the shifting capability frontier and ends up wasting rollouts on prompts that are already solved or still out of reach. Existing approaches improve efficiency through filtering, curricula, adaptive rollout allocation, or teacher guidance, but they typically assume a fixed pool-which makes it hard to support stable on-policy pool growth-or they add extra teacher cost and latency. We introduce HeaPA (Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation), which maintains a bounded, evolving pool, tracks the frontier using heap-based boundary sampling, expands the pool via on-policy augmentation with lightweight asynchronous validation, and stabilizes correlated queries through topology-aware re-estimation of pool statistics and controlled reinsertion. Across two training corpora, two training recipes, and seven benchmarks, HeaPA consistently improves accuracy and reaches target performance with fewer computations while keeping wall-clock time comparable. Our analyses suggest these gains come from frontier-focused sampling and on-policy pool growth, with the benefits becoming larger as model scale increases.

In this work, we investigate these properties within the setting of the $k$-parity problem (computing the XOR sum of $k$ relevant bits), where neural networks typically exhibit grokking -- a prolonged plateau of chance-level performance followed by sudden generalization. We theoretically decompose the Masked Diffusion (MD) objective into a Signal regime which drives feature learning, and a Noise regime which serves as an implicit regularizer. By training nanoGPT using MD objective on the $k$-parity problem, we demonstrate that MD objective fundamentally alters the learning landscape, enabling rapid and simultaneous generalization without experiencing grokking. Furthermore, we leverage our theoretical insights to optimize the distribution of the mask probability in the MD objective. Our method significantly improves perplexity for 50M-parameter models and achieves superior results across both pre-training from scratch and supervised fine-tuning.

However, prevailing methods are predominantly task-centric and rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as short-term dependency modeling, static neighborhood semantics, and retrospective time usage. These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution.

In this work, a novel perspective for MU is presented upon low-dimensional feature subspaces, which gives rise to the potentials of separating the remaining and forgetting data herein. This separability motivates our LOFT, a method that proceeds unlearning in a LOw-dimensional FeaTure subspace from the pretrained model skithrough principal projections, which are optimized to maximally capture the information of the remaining data and meanwhile diminish that of the forgetting data. In training, LOFT simply optimizes a small-size projection matrix flexibly plugged into the pretrained model, and only requires one-shot feature fetching from the pretrained backbone instead of repetitively accessing the raw data. Hence, LOFT mitigates two critical issues in mainstream MU methods, i.e., the privacy leakage risk from massive data reload and the inefficiency of updates to the entire pretrained model. Extensive experiments validate the significantly lower computational overhead and superior unlearning performance of LOFT across diverse models, datasets, tasks, and applications.

In contrast, from a cognitive science perspective, reward learning remains overly dependent on external feedback, limiting flexibility and generalization. Although recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, mark a significant breakthrough, these models still rely primarily on reward-centric reinforcement learning paradigms. Whether and how the well-established phenomenon of latent learning in psychology can inform or emerge within LLMs' training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present novel findings from our experiments that LLMs also exhibit the latent learning dynamics. During an initial phase of unrewarded exploration, LLMs display modest performance improvements, as this phase allows LLMs to organize task-relevant knowledge without being constrained by reward-driven biases, and performance is further enhanced once rewards are introduced. LLMs post-trained under this two-stage exploration regime ultimately achieve higher competence than those post-trained with reward-based reinforcement learning throughout. Beyond these empirical observations, we also provide theoretical analyses for our experiments explaining why unrewarded exploration yields performance gains, offering a mechanistic account of these dynamics.

This requires efficiently managing the stability-plasticity dilemma and leveraging prior experience to rapidly generalize to novel tasks. While various enhancement strategies for both aspects have been proposed, achieving scalable performance by directly applying RL to sequential task streams remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that decouples CRL into two independent processes: training single-task teacher models through distributed RL and continually distilling them into a central generalist model. This design is motivated by the observation that RL excels at solving single tasks, while policy distillation -- a relatively stable supervised learning process -- is well aligned with large foundation models and multi-task learning. Moreover, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and a replay-based approach are employed to enhance the plasticity and stability of the continual policy distillation process. Extensive experiments on the Meta-World benchmark demonstrate that our framework enables efficient continual RL, recovering over 85% of teacher performance while constraining task-wise forgetting to within 10%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u4e2d\u592e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408MoE\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u56de\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027-\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230RL\u64c5\u957f\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u800c\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4e2d\u592e\u901a\u7528\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6(MoE)\u67b6\u6784\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff1b4) \u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u653e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728Meta-World\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u8d85\u8fc785%\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u9057\u5fd8\u63a7\u5236\u572810%\u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06CRL\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u5355\u4efb\u52a1RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u84b8\u998f\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408MoE\u548c\u56de\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027-\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7ec8\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was designed to improve reasoning, but in fact it worsens this situation through two failure modes: diversity collapse, where training amplifies a single solution strategy while ignoring alternatives of gradient signal, and gradient diminishing, where a large portion of questions yield zero gradients because all rollouts receive identical rewards. We propose TA-GRPO (Transform-Augmented GRPO), which generates semantically equivalent transformed variants of each question (via paraphrasing, variable renaming, and format changes) and computes advantages by pooling rewards across the entire group. This pooled computation ensures mixed rewards even when the original question is too easy or too hard, while training on diverse phrasings promotes multiple solution strategies. We provide theoretical justification showing that TA-GRPO reduces zero-gradient probability and improves generalization via reduced train-test distribution shift.

To address this, we propose STARS (Spike-Triggered Adaptive Reasoning Steering), a training-free framework designed to rectify cognitive inertia by monitoring latent dynamics. STARS identifies Cognitive Pivots-critical moments of reasoning transition-by detecting distinct L2 distance spikes in the hidden states. Upon detection, the framework employs geometric trajectory analysis to diagnose the structural nature of the transition and injects state-aware language cues to steer the model in real-time.

Current approaches usually rely on training families of model variants or model distillation, which requires additional training and supports only a pre-selected set of sizes rather than fine-grained adaptation at runtime. In this paper, we propose Elastic Spectral State Space Models (ES-SSM), which require only one-time training at full capacity, but can be directly truncated into arbitrary scales for budgeted, runtime inference without retraining. Our ES-SSM builds on Hankel spectral filtering over a state space model (SSM), coupled with a lightweight input-adaptive gate trained under randomized spectral budgets. Using a shared masked normalization rule over the ordered spectral channels, we encourage predictive capability to concentrate in low-index components, while higher-index components act primarily as refinement.

Submitted to ICML. 8 pages, 5 figures (+ appendix)", "summary": "Fine-tuning flow matching models is a central challenge in settings with limited data, evolving distributions, or strict efficiency demands, where unconstrained fine-tuning can erode the accuracy and efficiency gains learned during pretraining. Prior work has produced theoretical guarantees and empirical advances for reward-based fine-tuning formulations, but these methods often impose restrictions on permissible drift structure or training techniques. In this work, we propose Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT), a principled framework for fine-tuning flow-based generative models when samples from the target distribution are available. For stochastic flows, GFT defines a temperature-controlled sequence of intermediate objectives that smoothly interpolate between the pretrained and target drifts, approaching the true target as the temperature approaches zero. We prove convergence results for both marginal and conditional GFT objectives, enabling the use of suitable (e.g., optimal transport) couplings during GFT while preserving correctness. Empirically, GFT improves convergence stability and shortens probability paths, resulting in faster inference, while maintaining generation quality comparable to standard fine-tuning. Our results position GFT as a theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative for scalable adaptation of flow matching models under distribution shift.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGFT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e29\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6536\u655b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u6216\u6548\u7387\u8981\u6c42\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6f02\u79fb\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\u6709\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6e10\u8fdb\u5fae\u8c03(GFT)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u6d41\u5b9a\u4e49\u6e29\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1\u63d2\u503c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u652f\u6301\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7b49\u8026\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "GFT\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7f29\u77ed\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "GFT\u4e3a\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A critical design choice in such architectures is the goal representation-the compressed encoding of goals that serves as the interface between these levels. Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection. We prove that value sufficiency does not imply action sufficiency and empirically verify that the latter is more strongly associated with control success in a discrete environment. We further demonstrate that standard log-loss training of low-level policies naturally induces action-sufficient representations. Our experimental results a popular benchmark demonstrate that our actor-derived representations consistently outperform representations learned via value estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u4f5c\u5145\u5206\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6bd4\u4ef7\u503c\u5145\u5206\u6027\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f14\u5458\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9690\u542b\u5047\u8bbe\u4fdd\u7559\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u6240\u9700\u4fe1\u606f\u5c31\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ef7\u503c\u5145\u5206\u7684\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5b9a\u4e49\u52a8\u4f5c\u5145\u5206\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4ef7\u503c\u5145\u5206\u6027\u4e0d\u8574\u542b\u52a8\u4f5c\u5145\u5206\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u52a8\u4f5c\u5145\u5206\u6027\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u6210\u529f\u66f4\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u6570\u635f\u5931\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4f4e\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u7136\u8bf1\u5bfc\u52a8\u4f5c\u5145\u5206\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f14\u5458\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u793a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u5145\u5206\u6027\u6bd4\u4ef7\u503c\u5145\u5206\u6027\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u79bb\u7ebf\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f14\u5458\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u793a\u800c\u975e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u5145\u5206\u6027\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u800c\u4ef7\u503c\u5145\u5206\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Both settings overlook a common real-world property: problem patterns may drift continually over time, yielding massive tasks sequentially arising while offering only limited training resources per task. In this paper, we study a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers under continually drifting tasks over learning time steps, where sufficient training for any given task at any time is not available. We propose Dual Replay with Experience Enhancement (DREE), a general framework to improve learning efficiency and mitigate catastrophic forgetting under such drift. Extensive experiments show that, under such continual drift, DREE effectively learns new tasks, preserves prior knowledge, improves generalization to unseen tasks, and can be applied to diverse existing neural solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDREE\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3VRP\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f02\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u7684\u7ec8\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u56de\u653e\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VRP\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u987a\u5e8f\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7ec8\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u90fd\u5047\u8bbe\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u5145\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u8fd9\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u95ee\u9898\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f1a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4efb\u52a1\u5927\u91cf\u987a\u5e8f\u51fa\u73b0\u4f46\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u53ea\u6709\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDREE\uff08Dual Replay with Experience Enhancement\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53cc\u91cd\u56de\u653e\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f02\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f02\u79fb\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0cDREE\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u5148\u524d\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "DREE\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3VRP\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f02\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u7684\u7ec8\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u6301\u7eed\u53d8\u5316\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

While recent work reveals the discrepancy between LLMs and humans in skill compositions, the learning dynamics of skill compositions and the underlying cause of non-human behavior remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality. To explain these behaviors, we provide evidence that correlational matching to the training data, rather than causal or procedural composition, shapes learning dynamics. We further show that shattered compositionality persists in modern LLMs and is not mitigated by pure model scaling or scratchpad-based reasoning. Our results reveal a fundamental mismatch between a model's learning behavior and desired skill compositions, with implications for reasoning reliability, out-of-distribution robustness, and alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e0d\u662f\u6309\u987a\u5e8f\u6784\u5efa\u800c\u662f\u7ecf\u5e38\u53cd\u5411\u6216\u5e76\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u610f\u5916\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u79f0\u4e3a\"\u7834\u788e\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\"\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u610f\u5916\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u975e\u9884\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793aLLMs\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7b97\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0Transformer\u4e0d\u662f\u6309\u7167\u4eba\u7c7b\u822c\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u89c4\u5219\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ee5\u53cd\u5411\u6216\u5e76\u884c\u65b9\u5f0f\u83b7\u53d6\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u610f\u5916\u6df7\u5408\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u6216\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u5851\u9020\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7834\u788e\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3LLMs\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u6a21\u578b\u7f29\u653e\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u8349\u7a3f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7f13\u89e3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u671f\u671b\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

This letter investigates the three-dimensional trajectory planning in a UAV-assisted VLC system, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from ground users (GUs). The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, the proposed reward mechanism significantly shortens the convergence steps by approximately 50%, demonstrating notable efficiency gains in the context of UAV-assisted VLC data collection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u6c34\u5e73\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u98de\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7167\u660e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u7684VLC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u89c4\u5212\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u98de\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9aVLC\u4fe1\u9053\u589e\u76ca\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u6700\u4f18\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65b0\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u7d20\u9a71\u52a8\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u53cc\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6df1\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe35%\u7684\u98de\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed\u4e86\u7ea650%\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6b65\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9VLC\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u6c34\u5e73\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u667a\u80fd\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Predicting this disease early is challenging because it depends on traditional diagnostic methods that face issues of subjectivity, which commonly delay diagnosis. Several objective analyses are currently in practice to help overcome the challenges of subjectivity; however, a proper explanation of these analyses is still lacking. While machine learning (ML) has demonstrated potential in supporting PD diagnosis, existing approaches often rely on subjective reports only and lack interpretability for individualized risk estimation. This study proposes SCOPE-PD, an explainable AI-based prediction framework, by integrating subjective and objective assessments to provide personalized health decisions. Subjective and objective clinical assessment data are collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study to construct a multimodal prediction framework.

Diffusion models for graphs often adopt largely factorized forward-noising, and many flow-matching methods start from factorized reference noise and coordinate-wise interpolation, so node-edge coupling is not encoded by the generative geometry and must be recovered implicitly by the core network, which can be brittle after discrete decoding. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) evolve distribution parameters and naturally support discrete generation. But classical BFNs typically rely on factorized beliefs and independent channels, which limit geometric evidence fusion. We propose Variational Bayesian Flow Network (VBFN), which performs a variational lifting to a tractable joint Gaussian variational belief family governed by structured precisions. Each Bayesian update reduces to solving a symmetric positive definite linear system, enabling coupled node and edge updates within a single fusion step. We construct sample-agnostic sparse precisions from a representation-induced dependency graph, thereby avoiding label leakage while enforcing node-edge consistency.

The general idea of rationale extraction (RE) is to provide an interpretable-by-design framework for DNNs via a select-predict architecture where two neural networks learn jointly to perform feature selection and prediction, respectively. Given only the remote supervision from the final task prediction, the process of learning to select subsets of features (or \\emph{rationales}) requires searching in the space of all possible feature combinations, which is computationally challenging and even harder when the base neural networks are not sufficiently capable. To improve the predictive performance of RE models that are based on less capable or smaller neural networks (i.e., the students), we propose \\textbf{REKD} (\\textbf{R}ationale \\textbf{E}xtraction with \\textbf{K}nowledge \\textbf{D}istillation) where a student RE model learns from the rationales and predictions of a teacher (i.e., a \\emph{rationalist}) in addition to the student's own RE optimization. This structural adjustment to RE aligns well with how humans could learn effectively from interpretable and verifiable knowledge. Because of the neural-model agnostic nature of the method, any black-box neural network could be integrated as a backbone model. To demonstrate the viability of REKD, we conduct experiments with multiple variants of BERT and vision transformer (ViT) models.

Though performance gains are often claimed, inconsistent conclusions also arise from time to time, making the progress illusive. Reflecting on this illusion, we still lack principled answers to two fundamental questions: 1) what is the role of each design choice? 2) which ones are critical? This paper aims to shed light on them. The underlying challenge is that design choices are entangled together, making their contribution to learning and generalization difficult to attribute. To address this challenge, we first construct a minimalist baseline for disentangling factors: one rollout per query in each round, the outcome reward serving as the training signal without any advantage trick, and a batch size of thirty-two. This baseline connects to batched contextual bandit learning, which facilitates experimental analysis. Centering around this baseline, we design an experiment pipeline, examining the marginal gains of factors like advantage, number of rollouts, etc. Experiments on three base models and two datasets, not only reveal new understanding on the role of various design choices on learning and generalization dynamics, but also identify critical ones that deserve more effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7b80\u7ea6\u57fa\u7ebf\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5404\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8981\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u4f18\u5316\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u5404\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5173\u952e\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fdb\u5c55\u865a\u5e7b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7b80\u7ea6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u6bcf\u8f6e\u67e5\u8be2\u4e00\u6b21rollout\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u65e0\u4f18\u52bf\u6280\u5de7\u3001\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f32\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u6279\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587bandit\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u52bf\u3001rollout\u6570\u91cf\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u503c\u5f97\u66f4\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8981\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8fb9\u9645\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u907f\u514d\u865a\u5e7b\u8fdb\u5c55\u5e76\u805a\u7126\u5173\u952e\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Model-based mechanisms compute prospective action values using an internal model of the environment, supporting flexible but computationally costly planning; model-free mechanisms cache value estimates and build heuristics that enable fast, efficient habitual responding; and memory-based mechanisms allow rapid adaptation from individual experience. In this work, we aim to elucidate the computational principles underlying this biological efficiency and translate them into a sampling algorithm for scalable Bayesian inference through effective exploration of the posterior distribution. More specifically, our proposed algorithm comprises three components: a model-based module that uses the target distribution for guided but computationally slow sampling; a model-free module that uses previous samples to learn patterns in the parameter space, enabling fast, reflexive sampling without directly evaluating the expensive target distribution; and an episodic-control module that supports rapid sampling by recalling specific past events (i.e., samples). We show that this approach advances Bayesian methods and facilitates their application to large-scale statistical machine learning problems.

EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \\textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \\textbf{27}\\%) and memory efficiency (up to \\textbf{30}\\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEUGens\u5c42\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7a20\u5bc6\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u8303\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece\u4e8c\u6b21\u964d\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u524d\u9988\u5c42\uff08FFLs\uff09\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6FFLs\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEUGens\u5c42\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u903c\u8fd1\u6807\u51c6FFLs\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8f93\u5165\u8303\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9ad8\u6548FFL\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4eceO(n\u00b2)\u964d\u5230O(n)\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728Transformer\u548cMLP\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210EUGens\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c3D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe27%\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe30%\u3002", "conclusion": "EUGens\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing federated methods frequently struggle with this data heterogeneity, typically entangling globally shared patterns with client-specific local dynamics within a single representation. In this work, we postulate that this heterogeneity stems from the entanglement of two distinct generative sources: client-specific localized dynamics and cross-client global spatial-temporal patterns. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce FedDis, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage causal disentanglement for federated spatial-temporal prediction. Architecturally, FedDis comprises a dual-branch design wherein a Personalized Bank learns to capture client-specific factors, while a Global Pattern Bank distills common knowledge. This separation enables robust cross-client knowledge transfer while preserving high adaptability to unique local environments. Crucially, a mutual information minimization objective is employed to enforce informational orthogonality between the two branches, thereby ensuring effective disentanglement. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedDis consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, promising efficiency, and superior expandability.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedDis\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7f20\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u90a6\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u79bb\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u975eIID\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6e90\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\uff1a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5168\u5c40\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u5f0f", "method": "FedDis\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u94f6\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u6355\u83b7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5f0f\u94f6\u884c\u63d0\u53d6\u5171\u540c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5236\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u7f20", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedDis\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027", "conclusion": "FedDis\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7f20\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u90a6\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u72ec\u7279\u672c\u5730\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u6027"}}

Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs.

In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

Submitted to IJCAI 2026", "summary": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralizing raw data, but privacy regulations such as the right to be forgotten require FL systems to remove the influence of previously used training data upon request. Retraining a federated model from scratch is prohibitively expensive, motivating federated unlearning (FU). However, existing FU methods suffer from high unlearning overhead, utility degradation caused by entangled knowledge, and unintended relearning during post-unlearning recovery. In this paper, we propose FedCARE, a unified and low overhead FU framework that enables conflict-aware unlearning and relearning-resistant recovery. FedCARE leverages gradient ascent for efficient forgetting when target data are locally available and employs data free model inversion to construct class level proxies of shared knowledge. Based on these insights, FedCARE integrates a pseudo-sample generator, conflict-aware projected gradient ascent for utility preserving unlearning, and a recovery strategy that suppresses rollback toward the pre-unlearning model. FedCARE supports client, instance, and class level unlearning with modest overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures under both IID and non-IID settings show that FedCARE achieves effective forgetting, improved utility retention, and reduced relearning risk compared to state of the art FU baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedCARE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51b2\u7a81\u611f\u77e5\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u6297\u91cd\u5b66\u4e60\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u9075\u5b88\"\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\"\u7b49\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u6548\u7528\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u610f\u5916\u91cd\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "FedCARE\u91c7\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u6f14\u6784\u5efa\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f2a\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u51b2\u7a81\u611f\u77e5\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u548c\u6291\u5236\u56de\u6eda\u7684\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedCARE\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u9057\u5fd8\u3001\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u7528\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u91cd\u5b66\u4e60\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u9057\u5fd8\u7ea7\u522b\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u9002\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "FedCARE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

However, effectively integrating information across graphs with differing topologies, scales, and semantics, often in the absence of shared node identities, remains a significant challenge. We present the Multi-Graph Meta-Transformer (MGMT), a unified, scalable, and interpretable framework for cross-graph learning. MGMT first applies Graph Transformer encoders to each graph, mapping structure and attributes into a shared latent space. It then selects task-relevant supernodes via attention and builds a meta-graph that connects functionally aligned supernodes across graphs using similarity in the latent space. Additional Graph Transformer layers on this meta-graph enable joint reasoning over intra- and inter-graph structure. The meta-graph provides built-in interpretability: supernodes and superedges highlight influential substructures and cross-graph alignments. Evaluating MGMT on both synthetic datasets and real-world neuroscience applications, we show that MGMT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in graph-level prediction tasks while offering interpretable representations that facilitate scientific discoveries.

Existing studies commonly assume that the collaboration ends up with the unlearning operation, overlooking the follow-up situation where the federated training continues over the remaining data.We identify a critical failure mode, termed Knowledge resurfacing, by revealing that continued training can re-activate unlearned knowledge and cause the removed influence to resurface in the global model. To address this, we propose Lethe, a novel federated unlearning method that de-correlates knowledge to be unlearned from knowledge to be retained, ensuring persistent erasure during continued training.Lethe follows a Reshape--Rectify--Restore pipeline: a temporary adapter is first trained with gradient ascent on the unlearning data to obtain magnified updates, which is then used as corrective signals to diverge layer-wise rectification on the remaining updates in two streams. Finally, the adapter is removed and a short recovery stage is performed on the retained data. Our experiments show that Lethe supports unlearning in the federated system at all levels in a unified manner and maintains superior persistence (Resurfacing Rate <1% in most cases) even after numerous rounds of follow-up training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faLethe\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u5df2\u5220\u9664\u77e5\u8bc6\u91cd\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5f85\u5220\u9664\u4e0e\u5f85\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u4e45\u64e6\u9664", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u5fd8\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u9057\u5fd8\u64cd\u4f5c\u540e\u534f\u4f5c\u7ed3\u675f\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u540e\u7eed\u6301\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5df2\u5220\u9664\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u91cd\u73b0\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLethe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Reshape-Rectify-Restore\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e34\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u83b7\u5f97\u653e\u5927\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6821\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d41\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u7ea7\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u79fb\u9664\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5e76\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u77ed\u671f\u6062\u590d", "result": "Lethe\u80fd\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u5f0f\u652f\u6301\u8054\u90a6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u91cd\u73b0\u7387\uff08<1%\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u6027", "conclusion": "Lethe\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u91cd\u73b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u64e6\u9664\uff0c\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

However, existing methods struggle with difficult reasoning problems for two reasons: raw test questions are often too difficult to yield high-quality pseudo-labels, and the limited size of test sets makes continuous online updates prone to instability. To address these limitations, we propose TTCS, a co-evolving test-time training framework. Specifically, TTCS initializes two policies from the same pretrained model: a question synthesizer and a reasoning solver. These policies evolve through iterative optimization: the synthesizer generates progressively challenging question variants conditioned on the test questions, creating a structured curriculum tailored to the solver's current capability, while the solver updates itself using self-consistency rewards computed from multiple sampled responses on both original test and synthetic questions. Crucially, the solver's feedback guides the synthesizer to generate questions aligned with the model's current capability, and the generated question variants in turn stabilize the solver's test-time training. Experiments show that TTCS consistently strengthens the reasoning ability on challenging mathematical benchmarks and transfers to general-domain tasks across different LLM backbones, highlighting a scalable path towards dynamically constructing test-time curricula for self-evolving.

Mainstream solutions such as domain adaptation and meta-learning still rely on large amounts of historical degradation data from equipment that is identical or similar to the target, which imposes significant limitations in practical applications. This study investigates PEFT-MuTS, a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning framework for few-shot RUL prediction, built on cross-domain pre-trained time-series representation models. Contrary to the widely held view that knowledge transfer in RUL prediction can only occur within similar devices, we demonstrate that substantial benefits can be achieved through pre-training process with large-scale cross-domain time series datasets. A independent feature tuning network and a meta-variable-based low rank multivariate fusion mechanism are developed to enable the pre-trained univariate time-series representation backbone model to fully exploit the multivariate relationships in degradation data for downstream RUL prediction task. Additionally, we introduce a zero-initialized regressor that stabilizes the fine-tuning process under few-shot conditions. Experiments on aero-engine and industrial bearing datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve effective RUL prediction even when less than 1\\% of samples of target equipment are used. Meanwhile, it substantially outperforms conventional supervised and few-shot approaches while markedly reducing the data required to achieve high predictive accuracy.

Distinguished from previous neuro-symbolic methods limited by passive post-hoc validation, our approach actively penalizes intermediate fallacies during the reasoning chain. We operationalize this framework via a novel two-stage training pipeline that synergizes formal logic verification-guided supervised fine-tuning and policy optimization.

While most methods score individual examples, practitioners often need group-level answers (e.g., artistic styles or object classes). Group-wise attribution is counterfactual: how would a model's behavior on a generated sample change if a group were absent from training? A natural realization of this counterfactual is Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) retraining, which retrains the model with each group removed; however, it becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of groups grows. We propose GUDA (Group Unlearning-based Data Attribution) for diffusion models, which approximates each counterfactual model by applying machine unlearning to a shared full-data model instead of training from scratch. GUDA quantifies group influence using differences in a likelihood-based scoring rule (ELBO) between the full model and each unlearned counterfactual. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and artistic style attribution with Stable Diffusion show that GUDA identifies primary contributing groups more reliably than semantic similarity, gradient-based attribution, and instance-level unlearning approaches, while achieving x100 speedup on CIFAR-10 over LOGO retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "GUDA\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfLOGO\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0100\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u7b54\u6848\uff08\u5982\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u6216\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u522b\uff09\u3002\u7fa4\u4f53\u5f52\u56e0\u662f\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\uff1a\u5982\u679c\u67d0\u4e2a\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4f1a\u5982\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\uff1fLOGO\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u867d\u7136\u81ea\u7136\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGUDA\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u4ece\u5171\u4eab\u5168\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\uff08ELBO\uff09\u5728\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9057\u5fd8\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cStable Diffusion\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u5f52\u56e0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cGUDA\u6bd4\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4LOGO\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0100\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "GUDA\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

A core challenge in comparing these two GNN training approaches lies in characterizing their model performance (i.e., convergence and generalization) and computational efficiency. While a batch size has been an effective lens in analyzing such behaviors in deep neural networks (DNNs), GNNs extend this lens by introducing a fan-out size, as full-graph training can be viewed as mini-batch training with the largest possible batch size and fan-out size. However, the impact of the batch and fan-out size for GNNs remains insufficiently explored. To this end, this paper systematically compares full-graph vs. mini-batch training of GNNs through empirical and theoretical analyses from the view points of the batch size and fan-out size. Our key contributions include: 1) We provide a novel generalization analysis using the Wasserstein distance to study the impact of the graph structure, especially the fan-out size. 2) We uncover the non-isotropic effects of the batch size and the fan-out size in GNN convergence and generalization, providing practical guidance for tuning these hyperparameters under resource constraints. Finally, full-graph training does not always yield better model performance or computational efficiency than well-tuned smaller mini-batch settings.

In this work, we provide a theoretical examination of consistency models by analyzing them from a flow map-based perspective. This joint analysis clarifies how training stability and convergence behavior can give rise to degenerate solutions. Building on these insights, we revisit self-distillation as a practical remedy for certain forms of suboptimal convergence and reformulate it to avoid excessive gradient norms for stable optimization.

Periodicity generalization represents a model's ability to extract periodic patterns from training data and generalize to OOD scenarios. We introduce a unified interpretation of periodicity from the perspective of abstract algebra and reasoning, including both single and composite periodicity, to explain why Transformers struggle to generalize periodicity.

Acceptance and effective adoption by clinicians and patients, as well as regulatory approval, require evidence of trustworthiness. A major factor for the development of trustworthy AI is the quantification of data quality for AI model training and testing. We have recently proposed the METRIC-framework for systematically evaluating the suitability (fit-for-purpose) of data for medical ML for a given task. Here, we operationalize this theoretical framework by introducing a collection of data quality metrics - the metric library - for practically measuring data quality dimensions. For each metric, we provide a metric card with the most important information, including definition, applicability, examples, pitfalls and recommendations, to support the understanding and implementation of these metrics.

Code and live demo available at https://github.com/riteshbhadana/IR-Drop-Predictor", "summary": "IR-drop is a critical power integrity challenge in modern VLSI designs that can cause timing degradation, reliability issues, and functional failures if not detected early in the design flow. Conventional IR-drop analysis relies on physics-based signoff tools, which provide high accuracy but incur significant computational cost and require near-final layout information, making them unsuitable for rapid early-stage design exploration. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based surrogate modeling approach for early-stage IR-drop estimation using a CNN. The task is formulated as a dense pixel-wise regression problem, where spatial physical layout features are mapped directly to IR-drop heatmaps. A U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections is employed to effectively capture both local and global spatial dependencies within the layout. The model is trained on a physics-inspired synthetic dataset generated by us, which incorporates key physical factors including power grid structure, cell density distribution, and switching activity. Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict IR-drop distributions with millisecond-level inference time, enabling fast pre-signoff screening and iterative design optimization. The proposed framework is intended as a complementary early-stage analysis tool, providing designers with rapid IR-drop insight prior to expensive signoff analysis.

However, the proliferation of LoRA variants has led to fragmentation in methodology, theory, code, and evaluation. To this end, this work presents the first unified study of LoRA variants, offering a systematic taxonomy, unified theoretical review, structured codebase, and standardized empirical assessment. First, we categorize LoRA variants along four principal axes: rank, optimization dynamics, initialization, and integration with Mixture-of-Experts. Then, we review their relationships and evolution within a common theoretical framework focused on low-rank update dynamics. Further, we introduce LoRAFactory, a modular codebase that implements variants through a unified interface, supporting plug-and-play experimentation and fine-grained analysis. Last, using this codebase, we conduct a large-scale evaluation across natural language generation, natural language understanding, and image classification tasks, systematically exploring key hyperparameters.

However, they fail when observations contain action-correlated distractors, often encoding noise instead of meaningful latent actions. Humans, on the other hand, can effortlessly distinguish task-relevant motions from irrelevant details in any video given only a brief task description. In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters. Interestingly, we find that more recent VLMs may perform worse than older ones.

In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By \"breaking the blocks\" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoRDS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u5efa\u6a21\u7f29\u653e\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5757\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5757\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6253\u7834\u8fd9\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e2\u9ad8\u6548\u53c8\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLoRDS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7f29\u653e\u6d41\u5f62\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635(S=BA)\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fPTQ\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u8054\u5408QAT\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u79e9\u4e58\u6cd5PEFT\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684Triton\u5185\u6838\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama3-8B\u4e0a\uff0c3\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u6bd4NormalFloat\u91cf\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534727.0%\uff0cNVIDIA RTX 4090\u4e0a\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.5\u500d\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1PEFT\u6027\u80fd\u6bd44\u6bd4\u7279QLoRA\u63d0\u53479.6%\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRDS\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u9002\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We further show that these relationships can be explained by a single geometric property of learned representations: the local intrinsic dimension of embeddings. Lower local dimension is consistently associated with stronger model--model alignment, stronger model--brain alignment, and better generalization, whereas global dimension measures fail to capture these effects.

The effect of an action is usually not identifiable under unobserved confounding, even with an infinite amount of data. Recent work uses neural networks to obtain practical bounds to such causal effects, which is often an intractable problem. However, these approaches may overfit to the dataset and be overconfident in their causal effect estimates. Moreover, there is currently no systematic approach to disentangle how much of the width of causal effect bounds is due to fundamental non-identifiability versus how much is due to finite-sample limitations. We propose a novel framework to address this problem by considering a confidence set around the empirical observational distribution and obtaining the intersection of causal effect bounds for all distributions in this confidence set. This allows us to distinguish the part of the interval that can be reduced by collecting more samples, which we call sample uncertainty, from the part that can only be reduced by observing more variables, such as latent confounders or instrumental variables, but not with more data, which we call non-ID uncertainty. The upper and lower bounds to this intersection are obtained by solving min-max and max-min problems with neural causal models by searching over all distributions that the dataset might have been sampled from, and all SCMs that entail the corresponding distribution. We demonstrate via extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets that our algorithm can determine when collecting more samples will not help determine the best action.

A Principled Analysis of Softmax-family Loss", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": "34 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "The Softmax loss is one of the most widely employed surrogate objectives for classification and ranking tasks. To elucidate its theoretical properties, the Fenchel-Young framework situates it as a canonical instance within a broad family of surrogates. Concurrently, another line of research has addressed scalability when the number of classes is exceedingly large, in which numerous approximations have been proposed to retain the benefits of the exact objective while improving efficiency. Building on these two perspectives, we present a principled investigation of the Softmax-family losses. We examine whether different surrogates achieve consistency with classification and ranking metrics, and analyze their gradient dynamics to reveal distinct convergence behaviors. We also introduce a systematic bias-variance decomposition for approximate methods that provides convergence guarantees, and further derive a per-epoch complexity analysis, showing explicit trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on a representative task demonstrate a strong alignment between consistency, convergence, and empirical performance. Together, these results establish a principled foundation and offer practical guidance for loss selections in large-class machine learning applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Softmax\u7cfb\u5217\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u635f\u5931\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "Softmax\u635f\u5931\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u65b9\u5411\uff1a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff08Fenchel-Young\u6846\u67b6\uff09\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff08\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7c7b\u522b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5bf9Softmax\u7cfb\u5217\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "1) \u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2) \u5206\u6790\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b3) \u4e3a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b4) \u63a8\u5bfc\u6bcf\u8f6e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u635f\u5931\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3aSoftmax\u7cfb\u5217\u635f\u5931\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u635f\u5931\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6536\u655b\u7279\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u635f\u5931\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The model outputs both the solution and its scaling structure. We prove identifiability, or unique recovery, and show that, under these conditions, the squared error between learned and true exponents scales as $O(|\u03bc- \u03b1|^2)$. Across experiments, MSN-PINN achieves single-exponent recovery with 1--5% error under noise and sparse sampling. It recovers corner singularity exponents for the two-dimensional Laplace equation with 0.009% error, matches the classical result of Kondrat'ev (1967), and recovers forcing-induced exponents in singular Poisson problems with 0.03% and 0.05% errors. On a 40-configuration wedge benchmark, it reaches a 100% success rate with 0.022% mean error.

Evaluations on 12 generative and classification benchmarks show that OSNIP achieves state-of-the-art performance, sharply reducing attack success rates while maintaining strong model utility under strict security constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "OSNIP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u52a0\u5bc6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u5d4c\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u5230\"\u6df7\u6dc6\u8bed\u4e49\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\"\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4LLM\u63a8\u7406\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4fdd\u62a4\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ebf\u6027\u6838\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u76f4\u89c9\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230LLM\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\"\u6df7\u6dc6\u8bed\u4e49\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\"\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u5d4c\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6b64\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bc6\u94a5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6620\u5c04\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6270\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "OSNIP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4LLM\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5373\u53ef\u786e\u4fdd\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u6dc6\u8bed\u4e49\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

We study generalization from a representation-centric perspective and analyze how the geometry of learned embeddings controls predictive performance for a fixed trained model. We show that population risk can be bounded by two factors: (i) the intrinsic dimension of the embedding distribution, which determines the convergence rate of empirical embedding distribution to the population distribution in Wasserstein distance, and (ii) the sensitivity of the downstream mapping from embeddings to predictions, characterized by Lipschitz constants. Together, these yield an embedding-dependent error bound that does not rely on parameter counts or hypothesis class complexity.

We train 300 models and conduct over 10,000 experiments, rigorously controlling compute budgets while independently varying model size, number of training tokens, and molecular representation.

T Martins"], "title": "Sparse Attention as Compact Kernel Regression", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": "16 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Recent work has revealed a link between self-attention mechanisms in transformers and test-time kernel regression via the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, with standard softmax attention corresponding to a Gaussian kernel. However, a kernel-theoretic understanding of sparse attention mechanisms is currently missing. In this paper, we establish a formal correspondence between sparse attention and compact (bounded support) kernels. We show that normalized ReLU and sparsemax attention arise from Epanechnikov kernel regression under fixed and adaptive normalizations, respectively. More generally, we demonstrate that widely used kernels in nonparametric density estimation -- including Epanechnikov, biweight, and triweight -- correspond to $\u03b1$-entmax attention with $\u03b1= 1 + \\frac{1}{n}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, while the softmax/Gaussian relationship emerges in the limit $n \\to \\infty$. This unified perspective explains how sparsity naturally emerges from kernel design and provides principled alternatives to heuristic top-$k$ attention and other associative memory mechanisms. Experiments with a kernel-regression-based variant of transformers -- Memory Mosaics -- show that kernel-based sparse attention achieves competitive performance on language modeling, in-context learning, and length generalization tasks, offering a principled framework for designing attention mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u7d27\u652f\u6491\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86ReLU\u548csparsemax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5e94\u56fa\u5b9a\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684Epanechnikov\u6838\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u7d27\u652f\u6491\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eReLU\u548csparsemax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5e94Epanechnikov\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u03b1-entmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u5e38\u7528\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u7d27\u652f\u6491\u6838\u51fd\u6570\uff0cReLU/sparsemax\u5bf9\u5e94Epanechnikov\u6838\uff0c\u03b1-entmax\u5bf9\u5e94Epanechnikov\u3001biweight\u3001triweight\u7b49\u6838\u51fd\u6570\uff0csoftmax/Gaussian\u5bf9\u5e94\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u7684Memory Mosaics\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u6838\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e86\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684top-k\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

On the one hand, fast, data-free, and model-agnostic methods (e.g., NF4 or HQQ) offer maximum accessibility but suffer from functional collapse at extreme bit-rates below 4 bits. On the other hand, techniques leveraging calibration data or extensive recovery training achieve superior fidelity but impose high computational constraints and face uncertain robustness under data distribution shifts. We introduce EntQuant, the first framework to unite the advantages of these distinct paradigms. By matching the performance of data-dependent methods with the speed and universality of data-free techniques, EntQuant enables practical utility in the extreme compression regime. Our method decouples numerical precision from storage cost via entropy coding, compressing a 70B parameter model in less than 30 minutes.

In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance.

While recent end-to-end methods can learn meaningful boundaries from the language-modeling objective alone, it remains difficult to quantitatively assess and systematically steer where compute is spent. We introduce a router-agnostic metric of boundary quality, boundary enrichment B, which measures how strongly chunk starts concentrate on positions with high next-byte surprisal. Guided by this metric, we propose Sombrero, which steers boundary placement toward predictive difficulty via a confidence-alignment boundary loss and stabilizes boundary learning by applying confidence-weighted smoothing at the input level rather than on realized chunks. On 1B scale, across UTF-8 corpora covering English and German text as well as code and mathematical content, Sombrero improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and yields boundaries that more consistently align compute with hard-to-predict positions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sombrero\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u5c42\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u8fb9\u754c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u754c\u5bcc\u96c6\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u6307\u5bfc\u8fb9\u754c\u653e\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f7f\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u66f4\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u96be\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5c42\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u538b\u7f29\u957f\u5b57\u8282\u5e8f\u5217\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6307\u5bfc\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5206\u914d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fb9\u754c\u5bcc\u96c6\u5ea6B\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u754c\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8861\u91cf\u5757\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4e0b\u4e00\u5b57\u8282\u60ca\u5947\u5ea6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faSombrero\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fb9\u754c\u635f\u5931\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fb9\u754c\u653e\u7f6e\u671d\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b2) \u5728\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u522b\u800c\u975e\u5df2\u5b9e\u73b0\u5757\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u7f6e\u4fe1\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u6ed1\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fb9\u754c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u57281B\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u6db5\u76d6\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u5fb7\u8bed\u6587\u672c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u5185\u5bb9\u7684UTF-8\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\uff0cSombrero\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u96be\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "Sombrero\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u754c\u5bcc\u96c6\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6307\u5bfc\u5206\u5c42\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via a novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats, called MS-EDEN, that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR. We integrate it into a novel fully-NVFP4 quantization scheme for linear layers, called Quartet II. We show analytically that Quartet II achieves consistently better gradient estimation across all major matrix multiplications, both on the forward and on the backward passes. In addition, our proposal synergizes well with recent training improvements aimed specifically at NVFP4. We further validate Quartet II on end-to-end LLM training with up to 1.9B parameters on 38B tokens. We provide kernels for execution on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs with up to 4.2x speedup over BF16.

However, generating mixed-type features that combine discrete states with an otherwise continuous distribution in a single feature remains challenging. We advance the state-of-the-art in diffusion models for tabular data with a cascaded approach. We first generate a low-resolution version of a tabular data row, that is, the collection of the purely categorical features and a coarse categorical representation of numerical features. Next, this information is leveraged in the high-resolution flow matching model via a novel guided conditional probability path and data-dependent coupling. The low-resolution representation of numerical features explicitly accounts for discrete outcomes, such as missing or inflated values, and therewith enables a more faithful generation of mixed-type features. We formally prove that this cascade tightens the transport cost bound.

However, existing medication recommender methods often struggle with a user (i.e., patient) cold-start problem, where recommendations for new patients are usually unreliable due to the lack of sufficient prescription history for patient profiling. While prior studies have utilized medical knowledge graphs to connect medication concepts through pharmacological or chemical relationships, these methods primarily focus on mitigating the item cold-start issue and fall short in providing personalized recommendations that adapt to individual patient characteristics. Meta-learning has shown promise in handling new users with sparse interactions in recommender systems. However, its application to EHRs remains underexplored due to the unique sequential structure of EHR data. To tackle these challenges, we propose MetaDrug, a multi-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework designed to address the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendation. MetaDrug proposes a novel two-level meta-adaptation mechanism, including self-adaptation, which adapts the model to new patients using their own medical events as support sets to capture temporal dependencies; and peer-adaptation, which adapts the model using similar visits from peer patients to enrich new patient representations.

Existing methods usually have heavy inference burden or rely on external knowledge, while Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has shown potential in reducing these issues by enabling parameter-efficient tuning. However, considering directly using LoRA to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem is non-trivial, we introduce a novel framework that restructures a single LoRA module as a decomposable Rank-1 Expert Pool. Our method learns to dynamically compose a sparse, task-specific update by selecting from this expert pool, guided by the semantics of the [CLS] token. In addition, we propose an Activation-Guided Orthogonal (AGO) loss that orthogonalizes critical parts of LoRA weights across tasks. This sparse composition and orthogonalization enable fewer parameter updates, resulting in domain-aware learning while minimizing inter-task interference and maintaining downstream task performance. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all metrics, surpassing zero-shot upper bounds in generalization. Notably, it reduces trainable parameters by 96.7% compared to the baseline method, eliminating reliance on external datasets or task-ID discriminators.

However, how to design latent representations with desirable equivariance properties for time-series generative modelling remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a latent flow-matching framework in which equivariance is explicitly encouraged through a simple regularisation of a pre-trained autoencoder. Specifically, we introduce an equivariance loss that enforces consistency between transformed signals and their reconstructions, and use it to fine-tune latent spaces with respect to basic time-series transformations such as translation and amplitude scaling.

However, we identify a discrepancy between the implicit semantic structure induced by different modality embeddings and the explicit graph structure. For instance, neighbors in the explicit graph structure may be close in one modality but distant in another. Since existing methods typically perform message passing over the fixed explicit graph structure, they inadvertently aggregate dissimilar features, introducing modality-specific noise and impeding effective node representation learning. To address this, we propose OptiMAG, an Unbalanced Optimal Transport-based regularization framework. OptiMAG employs the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to explicitly guide cross-modal structural consistency within local neighborhoods, effectively mitigating structural-semantic conflicts. Moreover, a KL divergence penalty enables adaptive handling of cross-modal inconsistencies. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing multimodal graph models, acting as an effective drop-in regularizer. Experiments demonstrate that OptiMAG consistently outperforms baselines across multiple tasks, ranging from graph-centric tasks (e.g., node classification, link prediction) to multimodal-centric generation tasks (e.g., graph2text, graph2image).

However, current energy evaluations for SNNs primarily focus on counting accumulate operations, and fail to account for real-world hardware costs such as data movement, which can consume nearly 80% of the total energy. In this paper, we propose Matterhorn, a spiking transformer that integrates a novel masked time-to-first-spike (M-TTFS) encoding method to reduce spike movement and a memristive synapse unit (MSU) to eliminate weight access overhead. M-TTFS employs a masking strategy that reassigns the zero-energy silent state (a spike train of all 0s) to the most frequent membrane potential rather than the lowest. This aligns the coding scheme with the data distribution, minimizing spike movement energy without information loss. We further propose a `dead zone' strategy that maximizes sparsity by mapping all values within a given range to the silent state. At the hardware level, the MSU utilizes compute-in-memory (CIM) technology to perform analog integration directly within memory, effectively removing weight access costs.

However, a fundamental limitation of this paradigm is the rigid structural coupling of model capacity to computational cost: expanding a model's parametric memory -- its repository of factual knowledge or visual patterns -- traditionally requires deepening or widening the network, which incurs a proportional rise in active FLOPs. In this work, we introduce $\\textbf{MoVE (Mixture of Value Embeddings)}$, a mechanism that breaks this coupling and establishes a new axis for scaling capacity. MoVE decouples memory from compute by introducing a global bank of learnable value embeddings shared across all attention layers. For every step in the sequence, the model employs a differentiable soft gating mechanism to dynamically mix retrieved concepts from this bank into the standard value projection. This architecture allows parametric memory to be scaled independently of network depth by simply increasing the number of embedding slots. We validate MoVE through strictly controlled experiments on two representative applications of autoregressive modeling: Text Generation and Image Generation.

To facilitate such generalization, linear temporal logic (LTL) has recently emerged as a powerful formalism for specifying structured, temporally extended tasks to RL agents. While existing approaches to LTL-guided multi-task RL demonstrate successful generalization across LTL specifications, they are unable to generalize to unseen vocabularies of propositions (or \"symbols\"), which describe high-level events in LTL.

We further introduce a novel PCA-based pre-rank that projects predictions onto principal directions of the predictive distribution.

Bayesian oblique splits provide uncertainty-aware partitioning of the input space, while GP leaves model local functional behaviour and enable principled extrapolation beyond the observed target range. We present an efficient inference and prediction scheme that combines posterior sampling of split parameters with \\gls{gp} posterior predictions, and a gating mechanism that activates GP-based extrapolation when inputs fall outside the training support of a leaf.

Codes in https://github.com/Chongjie-Si/Subspace-Tuning", "summary": "Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable success across diverse domains, yet fully fine-tuning incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has thus become a mainstream paradigm. Among them, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces trainable low-rank matrices and shows strong performance, nevertheless, its fixed-rank design limits flexibility. Dynamic rank allocation methods mitigate this issue by pruning redundant directions; however, they often rely on heuristic, element-level metrics that globally sort rank directions without matrix-wise distinction, and they lack mechanisms to expand capacity in layers requiring additional adaptation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexLoRA, an entropy-guided flexible low-rank adaptation framework that (i) evaluates matrix importance via spectral energy entropy, (ii) supports rank pruning and expansion under a global budget, and (iii) employs zero-impact initialization for newly added singular directions to ensure stability. By addressing granularity, flexibility, and stability limitations, FlexLoRA provides a more principled solution for PEFT.

By leveraging the DC structure of $r$, we can smooth out $r$ by applying Moreau envelopes to $r_1$ and $r_2$ separately. In line of DC programming, we then redistribute the concave part of the regularizer to the data fidelity and study its corresponding proximal Langevin algorithm (termed DC-LA). We establish convergence of DC-LA to the target distribution $\u03c0$, up to discretization and smoothing errors, in the $q$-Wasserstein distance for all $q \\in \\mathbb{N}^*$, under the assumption that $V$ is distant dissipative.

In this work, we propose \\emph{Environment-Conditioned Tail Reweighting for Total Variation Invariant Risk Minimization} (ECTR), a unified framework that augments TV-based invariant learning with environment-conditioned tail reweighting to jointly address both types of distribution shift. By integrating environment-level invariance with within-environment robustness, the proposed approach makes these two mechanisms complementary under mixed distribution shifts. We further extend the framework to scenarios without explicit environment annotations by inferring latent environments through a minimax formulation.

Here we leverage recent results on Transformer continuity to show in a rigorous manner how perplexity may be an unsuitable metric for model selection.

In this work, we resolve this open problem by introducing new analytical tools that yield an order-optimal Nash regret bound in linear bandits. Beyond Nash regret, we initiate the study of $p$-means regret in linear bandits, a unifying framework that interpolates between fairness and utility objectives and strictly generalizes Nash regret. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, FairLinBandit, that works as a meta-algorithm on top of any linear bandit strategy. We instantiate this framework using two bandit algorithms: Phased Elimination and Upper Confidence Bound, and prove that both achieve sublinear $p$-means regret for the entire range of $p$.

Current approaches attempt to enforce smoothness by directly regularizing the policy's output. We argue that this approach treats the symptom rather than the cause. In this work, we theoretically establish that policy non-smoothness is fundamentally governed by the differential geometry of the critic. By applying implicit differentiation to the actor-critic objective, we prove that the sensitivity of the optimal policy is bounded by the ratio of the Q-function's mixed-partial derivative (noise sensitivity) to its action-space curvature (signal distinctness). To empirically validate this theoretical insight, we introduce PAVE (Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization), a critic-centric regularization framework that treats the critic as a scalar field and stabilizes its induced action-gradient field. PAVE rectifies the learning signal by minimizing the Q-gradient volatility while preserving local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate that PAVE achieves smoothness and robustness comparable to policy-side smoothness regularization methods, while maintaining competitive task performance, without modifying the actor.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAVE\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u632f\u8361\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6f14\u5458\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fde\u7eed\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7ecf\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u9891\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u7269\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u6cbb\u6807\u4e0d\u6cbb\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPAVE\uff08Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u89c6\u4e3a\u6807\u91cf\u573a\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5176\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u68af\u5ea6\u573a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316Q\u68af\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u66f2\u7387\u6765\u4fee\u6b63\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660ePAVE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u4fa7\u5e73\u6ed1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6f14\u5458\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b56\u7565\u975e\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u7531\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\u800c\u975e\u7b56\u7565\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\u632f\u8361\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

A promising direction to further improve post-pruning performance is weight permutation, which reorders model weights into patterns more amenable to pruning. However, the exponential growth of the permutation search space with the scale of Transformer architectures forces most methods to rely on greedy or heuristic algorithms, limiting the effectiveness of reordering.\n  In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end learnable permutation framework. Our method introduces a learnable permutation cost matrix to quantify the cost of swapping any two input channels of a given weight matrix, a differentiable bipartite matching solver to obtain the optimal binary permutation matrix given a cost matrix, and a sparsity optimization loss function to directly optimize the permutation operator.

The method is plug-and-play with common decoding strategies (e.g., confidence, entropy, and margin-based ordering) and can be strengthened with a one-step lookahead variant.

However, existing training paradigms remain constrained: agents often traverse long-horizon sequences of memory operations before receiving sparse and delayed rewards, which hinders truly end-to-end optimization of memory management policies. To address this limitation, we introduce Mem-T, an autonomous memory agent that interfaces with a lightweight hierarchical memory database to perform dynamic updates and multi-turn retrieval over streaming inputs. To effectively train long-horizon memory management capabilities, we further propose MoT-GRPO, a tree-guided reinforcement learning framework that transforms sparse terminal feedback into dense, step-wise supervision via memory operation tree backpropagation and hindsight credit assignment, thereby enabling the joint optimization of memory construction and retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mem-T is (1) high-performing, surpassing frameworks such as A-Mem and Mem0 by up to $14.92\\%$, and (2) economical, operating on a favorable accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier and reducing inference tokens per query by $\\sim24.45\\%$ relative to GAM without sacrificing performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mem-T\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528MoT-GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u4ee3\u7406\u9700\u8981\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u540e\u624d\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u7a00\u758f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMem-T\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u68c0\u7d22\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51faMoT-GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u64cd\u4f5c\u6811\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u4e8b\u540e\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u7ec8\u7aef\u53cd\u9988\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "Mem-T\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8aA-Mem\u548cMem0\u7b49\u6846\u67b6\u8fbe14.92%\uff1b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u6548\u7387\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4GAM\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea624.45%\u7684\u63a8\u7406token\u6d88\u8017\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Mem-T\u901a\u8fc7MoT-GRPO\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Existing methods ignore, however, that anomalies can arise through two fundamentally different processes: measurement errors, where data was generated normally but one or more values were recorded incorrectly, and mechanism shifts, where the causal process generating the data changed. While measurement errors can often be safely corrected, mechanistic anomalies require careful consideration. We define a causal model that explicitly captures both types by treating outliers as latent interventions on latent (\"true\") and observed (\"measured\") variables. We show that they are identifiable, and propose a maximum likelihood estimation approach to put this to practice.

However, LLM generation is highly sequential, and long CoTs lead to a high latency. We propose to train Divide-and-Conquer CoT (DC-CoT) to reduce the latency. With DC-CoT, the model can act as a director that identifies distinct subtasks that can be performed in parallel in its reasoning process, and then spawns workers to execute the subtasks. Our goal is to achieve high accuracy, with a low longest path length, which is a theoretical measure of the latency needed for the response. We start with a long CoT base model (DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview), and first use SFT with a small curated demonstration set to initialize its ability to spawn workers in a certain format. Because SFT degrades the accuracy significantly, we design a multi-stage RL algorithm, with various data filtering strategies, to recover the accuracy while decreasing the longest path length. Across several benchmarks including AIME 2024 and HMMT 2025, DC-CoT achieves similar accuracy as DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview while decreasing longest path length by 35-40%.

However, recovering discrete permutations via annealing $\u03b5\\to 0$ is notoriously unstable. We identify a fundamental mechanism for this failure: \\textbf{Premature Mode Collapse}. By analyzing the non-normal dynamics of the Sinkhorn fixed-point map, we reveal a theoretical \\textbf{thermodynamic speed limit}. Under standard exponential cooling, the shift in the target posterior ($O(1)$) outpaces the contraction rate of the inference operator, which degrades as $O(1/\u03b5)$. This mismatch inevitably forces the inference trajectory into spurious local basins. To address this, we propose \\textbf{Efficient PH-ASC}, an adaptive scheduling algorithm that monitors the stability of the inference process. By enforcing a linear stability law, we decouple expensive spectral diagnostics from the training loop, reducing overhead from $O(N^3)$ to amortized $O(1)$.

While recent graph generation methods employ generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks to handle permutation invariance and irregular topologies, they typically rely on random edge sampling with fixed probabilities, limiting their capacity to capture complex structural dependencies between nodes. We propose a density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) that replaces random sampling with a learnable distance-based edge predictor. Our approach embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity correlates with edge likelihood, enabling the generator to learn meaningful connectivity patterns. A differentiable edge predictor determines pairwise relationships directly from node embeddings, while a density-aware selection mechanism adaptively controls edge density to match class-specific sparsity distributions observed in real graphs. We train the model using a WGAN with gradient penalty, employing a GCN-based critic to ensure generated graphs exhibit realistic topology and align with target class distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method produces graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity compared to existing baselines. The learned edge predictor captures complex relational patterns beyond simple heuristics, generating graphs whose density and topology closely match real structural distributions. Our results show improved training stability and controllable synthesis, making the framework effective for realistic graph generation and data augmentation.

To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Relative Rewards (RLRR), a framework that shifts reward shaping from absolute scoring to relative ranking. Complementing this framework, we introduce the Ranking Reward Model, a listwise preference model tailored for group-based optimization to directly generate relative rankings.

Shapley values are a widely used approach for explaining model predictions, but require direct access to the underlying model, an assumption frequently violated in real-world deployments. Further, even when model access is possible, their exact computation may be prohibitively expensive. We investigate whether meaningful Shapley value estimations can be obtained in a zero-shot setting, using only the input data distribution and no evaluations of the target model. To this end, we introduce ExplainerPFN, a tabular foundation model built on TabPFN that is pretrained on synthetic datasets generated from random structural causal models and supervised using exact or near-exact Shapley values. Once trained, ExplainerPFN predicts feature attributions for unseen tabular datasets without model access, gradients, or example explanations.\n  Our contributions are fourfold: (1) we show that few-shot learning-based explanations can achieve high fidelity to SHAP values with as few as two reference observations; (2) we propose ExplainerPFN, the first zero-shot method for estimating Shapley values without access to the underlying model or reference explanations; (3) we provide an open-source implementation of ExplainerPFN, including the full training pipeline and synthetic data generator; and (4) through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we show that ExplainerPFN achieves performance competitive with few-shot surrogate explainers that rely on 2-10 SHAP examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "ExplainerPFN\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672cShapley\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u5e95\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u5408\u6210\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u89e3\u91ca", "motivation": "Shapley\u503c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8bbf\u95ee\u5e95\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eTabPFN\u6784\u5efa\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u786e\u6216\u8fd1\u4f3cShapley\u503c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u5373\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0", "result": "ExplainerPFN\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f9d\u8d562-10\u4e2aSHAP\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4ee3\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4ec5\u97002\u4e2a\u53c2\u8003\u89c2\u6d4b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672cShapley\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

However, current state-of-the-art methods are not well-suited for modeling dynamical systems, as they construct conditional paths using linear interpolants that may not capture the underlying state evolution, especially when learning higher-order dynamics from irregular sampled observations. Constructing unified paths that satisfy multi-marginal constraints across observations is challenging, since na\u00efve higher-order polynomials tend to be unstable and oscillatory. We introduce SplineFlow, a theoretically grounded flow matching algorithm that jointly models conditional paths across observations via B-spline interpolation. Specifically, SplineFlow exploits the smoothness and stability of B-spline bases to learn the complex underlying dynamics in a structured manner while ensuring the multi-marginal requirements are met. Comprehensive experiments across various deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems of varying complexity, as well as on cellular trajectory inference tasks, demonstrate the strong improvement of SplineFlow over existing baselines.

This miscalibration is exacerbated by preference-based alignment methods breaking the link between predictive probability and correctness. We introduce a Calibration Aware Token-level Training Objective (CATTO), a calibration-aware objective that aligns predicted confidence with empirical prediction correctness, which can be combined with the original preference optimization objectives. Empirically, CATTO reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by 2.22%-7.61% in-distribution and 1.46%-10.44% out-of-distribution compared to direct preference optimization (DPO), and by 0.22%-1.24% in-distribution and 1.23%-5.07% out-of-distribution compared to the strongest DPO baseline. This improvement in confidence does not come at a cost of losing task accuracy, where CATTO maintains or slightly improves multiple-choice question-answering accuracy on five datasets.

In this work, we uncover a counter-intuitive optimization anomaly: models trained on short horizons-when coupled with our proposed Evolutionary Forecasting (EF) paradigm-significantly outperform those trained directly on long horizons. We attribute this success to the mitigation of a fundamental optimization pathology inherent in DF, where conflicting gradients from distant futures cripple the learning of local dynamics. We establish EF as a unified generative framework, proving that DF is merely a degenerate special case of EF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a singular EF model surpasses task-specific DF ensembles across standard benchmarks and exhibits robust asymptotic stability in extreme extrapolation.

Recent work offers a rigorous solution using conformal prediction in a full ranking scenario, which aims to construct prediction sets for the absolute ranks of test items based on the relative ranks of calibration items. However, relying on upper bounds of non-conformity scores renders the method overly conservative, resulting in substantially large prediction sets. To address this, we propose Distribution-informed Conformal Ranking (DCR), which produces efficient prediction sets by deriving the exact distribution of non-conformity scores. In particular, we find that the absolute ranks of calibration items follow Negative Hypergeometric distributions, conditional on their relative ranks. DCR thus uses the rank distribution to derive non-conformity score distribution and determine conformal thresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees that DCR achieves improved efficiency over the baseline while ensuring valid coverage under mild assumptions.

Many approaches have been proposed over the years to promote the generalisation ability of neural networks, collectively known as regularisation techniques. These are used as common practice under the assumption that any regularisation added to the pipeline would result in a performance improvement. In this study, we investigate whether this assumption holds in practice. First, we provide a broad review of regularisation techniques, including modern theories such as double descent. We propose a taxonomy of methods under four broad categories, namely: (1) data-based strategies, (2) architecture strategies, (3) training strategies, and (4) loss function strategies. Notably, we highlight the contradictions and correspondences between the approaches in these broad classes. Further, we perform an empirical comparison of the various regularisation techniques on classification tasks for ten numerical and image datasets applied to the multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network architectures. Results show that the efficacy of regularisation is dataset-dependent. For example, the use of a regularisation term only improved performance on numeric datasets, whereas batch normalisation improved performance on image datasets only. Generalisation is crucial to machine learning; thus, understanding the effects of applying regularisation techniques, and considering the connections between them is essential to the appropriate use of these methods in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6548\u679c\u5177\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\"\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u603b\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\"\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e38\u89c4\u5b9e\u8df5\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u4eec\u666e\u904d\u5047\u8bbe\u4efb\u4f55\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u90fd\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\u5426\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "method": "1. \u5bf9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u56de\u987e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u73b0\u4ee3\u7406\u8bba\u5982\u53cc\u4e0b\u964d\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3. \u572810\u4e2a\u6570\u503c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u5404\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5177\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff1a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u4ec5\u5728\u6570\u503c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u6279\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4ec5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6cdb\u5316\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u9002\u5f53\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e76\u975e\u603b\u662f\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

Among RL algorithms, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is the de facto standard, avoiding the need for a critic by using per-prompt baselines and variance normalization. Yet why and when this normalization helps remains unclear. In this work, we provide an explanation through the lens of local curvature of the sequence-level policy gradient: standard deviation normalization implements an adaptive gradient. Theoretically, under mild conditions, GRPO enjoys a strictly improved convergence rate over unnormalized REINFORCE, with gains characterized by the average within-prompt reward standard deviation across prompts and iterations. Empirically, our analysis on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks reveals three distinct training phases governed by the interplay between feature orthogonality and reward variance: (I) an early acceleration phase where high variance and orthogonality favor adaptive scaling; (II) a relatively stable transition phase; and (III) a late-stage regime where the loss of orthogonality limits further gains.

However, IoT systems are vulnerable to clock drift, time-synchronization manipulation, and timestamp discontinuities, such as the Year 2038 (Y2K38) Unix overflow, all of which disrupt temporal ordering. Conventional anomaly-detection models, which assume reliable timestamps, fail to capture temporal inconsistencies. This paper introduces STGAT (Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network), a framework that models both temporal distortion and inter-device consistency in energy IoT systems. STGAT combines drift-aware temporal embeddings and temporal self-attention to capture corrupted time evolution at individual devices, and uses graph attention to model spatial propagation of timing errors. A curvature-regularized latent representation geometrically separates normal clock evolution from anomalies caused by drift, synchronization offsets, and overflow events. Experimental results on energy IoT telemetry with controlled timing perturbations show that STGAT achieves 95.7% accuracy, outperforming recurrent, transformer, and graph-based baselines with significant improvements (d > 1.8, p < 0.001).

We propose perturbing the data distribution in a constraint-aware way such that the new distribution has support matching the ambient space dimension while still implicitly incorporating underlying manifold geometry. Through theoretical analyses and empirical evidence on several representative tasks, we illustrate that our approach consistently enables data distribution recovery and stable sampling with both diffusion models and normalizing flows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u65b0\u5206\u5e03\u652f\u6301\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u73af\u5883\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9690\u542b\u5e95\u5c42\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5e38\u9047\u5230\u6837\u672c\u53d7\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4fee\u6539\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5df2\u77e5\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6270\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u65b0\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u652f\u6301\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ecd\u9690\u542b\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u5e95\u5c42\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u6062\u590d\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u514b\u670d\u6570\u5b66\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This trend has inspired practical and academic interest in model editing, that is, in adjusting the weights of the model to modify its likely outputs for queries relating to a specific fact or set of facts. This may be done either to amend a fact or set of facts, for instance, to fix a frequent error in the training data, or to suppress a fact or set of facts entirely, for instance, in case of dangerous knowledge. Multiple methods have been proposed to do such edits. However, at the same time, it has been shown that such model editing can be brittle and incomplete. Moreover the effectiveness of any model editing method necessarily depends on the data on which the model is trained, and, therefore, a good understanding of the interaction of the training data distribution and the way it is stored in the network is necessary and helpful to reliably perform model editing. However, working with large language models trained on real-world data does not allow us to understand this relationship or fully measure the effects of model editing. We therefore propose Behemoth, a fully synthetic data generation framework. To demonstrate the practical insights from the framework, we explore model editing in the context of simple tabular data, demonstrating surprising findings that, in some cases, echo real-world results, for instance, that in some cases restricting the update rank results in a more effective update.

Reinforcement learning can help address this challenge by learning medication dosing policies from retrospective data. However, prior work on sedation and analgesia has optimized for objectives that do not value patient survival while relying on algorithms unsuitable for imperfect information settings. We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated. This suggests that valuing long-term outcomes could be critical for safer treatment policies, even if a short-term goal remains the primary objective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eMIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d47,144\u6b21ICU\u4f4f\u9662\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u836f\u7269\u5242\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u77ed\u671f\u75bc\u75db\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u75bc\u75db\u548c\u957f\u671f\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "ICU\u75bc\u75db\u7ba1\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u6cbb\u7597\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u60a3\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u91cd\u89c6\u60a3\u8005\u751f\u5b58\u7387\uff1b2) \u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u73af\u5883\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f6\u836f\u7269\u5242\u91cf\u5efa\u8bae\u3002\u4f7f\u7528MIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d47,144\u6b21ICU\u4f4f\u9662\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1) \u4ec5\u51cf\u5c11\u75bc\u75db\uff1b2) \u8054\u5408\u51cf\u5c11\u75bc\u75db\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u3002\u836f\u7269\u5305\u62ec\u963f\u7247\u7c7b\u3001\u4e19\u6cca\u915a\u3001\u82ef\u4e8c\u6c2e\u44ec\u7c7b\u548c\u53f3\u7f8e\u6258\u54aa\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u90fd\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u75bc\u75db\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u75bc\u75db\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u75bc\u75db\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u91cd\u89c6\u957f\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5236\u5b9a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u7b56\u7565\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u77ed\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u91cd\u89c6\u957f\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5236\u5b9a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684ICU\u75bc\u75db\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u77ed\u671f\u75bc\u75db\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u6b7b\u4ea1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u800c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

In practice, however, we identify alleviating gradient conflicts, misalignment between per-sample gradients, is a key factor that slows down the decay of marginal log-determinant information gains, thereby preventing significant loss of information. We formalize this via an $\\varepsilon$-decomposition that quantifies the deviation from ideal submodularity as a function of conflict statistics, yielding data-dependent approximation factors that tighten as conflicts diminish. Guided by this analysis, we propose SPICE, a conflict-aware selector that maximizes information while penalizing misalignment, and that supports early stopping and proxy models for efficiency. Empirically, SPICE selects subsets with higher log-determinant information than original criteria, and these informational gains translate into performance improvements: across 8 benchmarks with LLaMA2-7B and Qwen2-7B, SPICE uses only 10% of the data, yet matches or exceeds 6 methods including full-data tuning. This achieves performance improvements with substantially lower training cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPICE\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u51b2\u7a81\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u60e9\u7f5a\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4ec5\u752810%\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u5168\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u867d\u7136\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u5355\u8c03\u5b50\u6a21\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff08\u6837\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u4f1a\u51cf\u7f13\u8fb9\u9645\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4fe1\u606f\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u03b5-\u5206\u89e3\u7406\u8bba\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u7406\u60f3\u5b50\u6a21\u6027\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1SPICE\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff1a\u6700\u5927\u5316Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u60e9\u7f5a\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e9\u505c\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "SPICE\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u6807\u51c6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u57288\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752810%\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u5305\u62ec\u5168\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u5185\u76846\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u662f\u4fe1\u606f\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0cSPICE\u901a\u8fc7\u51b2\u7a81\u611f\u77e5\u9009\u62e9\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

While recent approaches have sought to segment trajectories into reusable skills or options, most rely on action labels, rewards, or handcrafted annotations, limiting their applicability. We propose a method that segments unlabelled trajectories into skills and induces a hierarchical structure over them using a grammar-based approach. The resulting hierarchy captures both low-level behaviours and their composition into higher-level skills. We evaluate our approach in high-dimensional, pixel-based environments, including Craftax and the full, unmodified version of Minecraft. Using metrics for skill segmentation, reuse, and hierarchy quality, we find that our method consistently produces more structured and semantically meaningful hierarchies than existing baselines. Furthermore, as a proof of concept for utility, we demonstrate that these discovered hierarchies accelerate and stabilise learning on downstream reinforcement learning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u6280\u80fd\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u4f4e\u5c42\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u5c42\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Craftax\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u7248Minecraft\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ef4\u50cf\u7d20\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u5272\u3001\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5177\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u5272\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0b\u6e38\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic \"reasoning style\" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u6d4b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u622a\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u6ce8\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b54\u6848\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u968f\u63a8\u7406token\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u5185\u5bb9\u800c\u975e\u957f\u5ea6\u6216\u98ce\u683c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed9\u51fa\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u524d\u4f1a\u751f\u6210\"\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\"\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u627f\u8bfa\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u6bb5\u662f\u5426\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d85\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u6216\u98ce\u683c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u6b65\u534f\u8bae\uff1a1)\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b2)\u5728\u56fa\u5b9atoken\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u5904\u622a\u65ad\uff1b3)\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u65b0\u6ce8\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u968f\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u63a8\u7406token\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u589e\u76ca\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u6216\u901a\u7528\"\u63a8\u7406\u98ce\u683c\"\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u66f4\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u80fd\u4ece\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u8f68\u8ff9\u6210\u529f\u56de\u6eaf\uff0c\u4f46\u5373\u65f6\u7b54\u6848\u5e38\u951a\u5b9a\u5728\u8f83\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u5904\u7406\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5047\u8bbe\u4e2d\u95f4token\u662f\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

We show a regret upper bound of $\\widetilde{O} (\\sqrt{d T \\log (K/\u03b4) \u03c3^2_{\\max})}$ for a horizon $T$, general action set of size $K$ of dimension $d$, and where $\u03c3^2_{\\max}$ is the maximal variance of the reward for any action. We further provide a lower bound of $\\widetilde\u03a9 (d \\sqrt{T \u03c3^2_{\\max}})$ which is tight (up to logarithmic factors) whenever $\\log (K) \\approx d$. For more specific action sets, $\\ell_p$ unit balls with $p \\leq 2$ and dual norm $q$, we show that the minimax regret is $\\widetilde\u0398 (\\sqrt{dT \u03c3^2_q)}$, where $\u03c3^2_q$ is a variance-dependent quantity that is always at most $4$. This is in contrast to the minimax regret attainable for such sets in the classic additive noise model, where the regret is of order $d \\sqrt{T}$.

MGN-T overcomes a key limitation of standard MGN, the inefficient long-range information propagation caused by iterative message passing on large, high-resolution meshes. A physics-attention Transformer serves as a global processor, updating all nodal states simultaneously while explicitly retaining node and edge attributes. By directly capturing long-range physical interactions, MGN-T eliminates the need for deep message-passing stacks or hierarchical, coarsened meshes, enabling efficient learning on high-resolution meshes with varying geometries, topologies, and boundary conditions at an industrial scale.\n  We demonstrate that MGN-T successfully handles industrial-scale meshes for impact dynamics, a setting in which standard MGN fails due message-passing under-reaching. The method accurately models self-contact, plasticity, and multivariate outputs, including internal, phenomenological plastic variables. Moreover, MGN-T outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on classical benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining practical efficiency, using only a fraction of the parameters required by competing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "MeshGraphNet-Transformer (MGN-T) \u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Transformers\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u548cMeshGraphNets\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6807\u51c6MGN\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6MeshGraphNets (MGN) \u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5c42\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u5806\u6808\u6216\u5206\u5c42\u7c97\u5316\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "MGN-T \u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Transformers\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548cMeshGraphNets\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7269\u7406\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u5904\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u5f0f\u4fdd\u7559\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6df1\u5c42\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u5806\u6808\u6216\u5206\u5c42\u7c97\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u3002", "result": "MGN-T \u6210\u529f\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u51b2\u51fb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6MGN\u56e0\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u81ea\u63a5\u89e6\u3001\u5851\u6027\u548c\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5185\u90e8\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u5851\u6027\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\u3002\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MGN-T \u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Transformers\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u548cMeshGraphNets\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7f51\u683c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Speculative decoding (SD) offers a powerful solution, providing significant speed-ups through its lightweight drafting and parallel verification mechanism. While existing work has nearly saturated improvements in draft effectiveness and efficiency, this paper advances SD from a new yet critical perspective: the verification cost. We propose TriSpec, a novel ternary SD framework that, at its core, introduces a lightweight proxy to significantly reduce computational cost by approving easily verifiable draft sequences and engaging the full target model only when encountering uncertain tokens. TriSpec can be integrated with state-of-the-art SD methods like EAGLE-3 to further reduce verification costs, achieving greater acceleration.

In this work, we prove exact learnability results for graph algorithms under bounded-degree and finite-precision constraints. Our approach follows a two-step process. First, we train an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to execute the local instructions of a single node. Second, during inference, we use the trained MLP ensemble as the update function within a graph neural network (GNN). Leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, we show that local instructions can be learned from a small training set, enabling the complete graph algorithm to be executed during inference without error and with high probability. To illustrate the learning power of our setting, we establish a rigorous learnability result for the LOCAL model of distributed computation.

Vehicular traffic has been identified as a major contributor to poor air quality. In a lot of cities the publicly available air quality measurements and forecasts are coarse-grained both in space and time. However, in general, real-time traffic intensity data is openly available in various forms and is fine-grained. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of pollution sensor measurements combined with traffic data from Mexico City. We analyse and model the relationship between traffic intensity and air quality with the aim to provide hyper-local, dynamic air quality forecasts. We developed an innovative method to represent traffic intensities by transforming simple colour-coded traffic maps into concentric ring-based descriptions, enabling improved characterisation of traffic conditions. Using Partial Least Squares Regression, we predict pollution levels based on these newly defined traffic intensities. The model was optimised with various training samples to achieve the best predictive performance and gain insights into the relationship between pollutants and traffic.

Aggregating subjective labels, though, may amplify individual biases, particularly regarding sensitive features, raising fairness concerns. Nonetheless, fairness in crowdsourced aggregation remains largely unexplored, with no existing convergence guarantees and only limited post-processing approaches for enforcing $\\varepsilon$-fairness under demographic parity. We address this gap by analyzing the fairness s of crowdsourced aggregation methods within the $\\varepsilon$-fairness framework, for Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian aggregation. In the small-crowd regime, we derive an upper bound on the fairness gap of Majority Vote in terms of the fairness gaps of the individual annotators. We further show that the fairness gap of the aggregated consensus converges exponentially fast to that of the ground-truth under interpretable conditions. Since ground-truth itself may still be unfair, we generalize a state-of-the-art multiclass fairness post-processing algorithm from the continuous to the discrete setting, which enforces strict demographic parity constraints to any aggregation rule.

Batley", "Sourav Saha"], "title": "Agile Reinforcement Learning through Separable Neural Architecture", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly deployed in resource-constrained environments, yet the go-to function approximators - multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) - are often parameter-inefficient due to an imperfect inductive bias for the smooth structure of many value functions. This mismatch can also hinder sample efficiency and slow policy learning in this capacity-limited regime. Although model compression techniques exist, they operate post-hoc and do not improve learning efficiency. Recent spline-based separable architectures - such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) - have been shown to offer parameter efficiency but are widely reported to exhibit significant computational overhead, especially at scale.\n  In seeking to address these limitations, this work introduces SPAN (SPline-based Adaptive Networks), a novel function approximation approach to RL. SPAN adapts the low rank KHRONOS framework by integrating a learnable preprocessing layer with a separable tensor product B-spline basis. SPAN is evaluated across discrete (PPO) and high-dimensional continuous (SAC) control tasks, as well as offline settings (Minari/D4RL). Empirical results demonstrate that SPAN achieves a 30-50% improvement in sample efficiency and 1.3-9 times higher success rates across benchmarks compared to MLP baselines. Furthermore, SPAN demonstrates superior anytime performance and robustness to hyperparameter variations, suggesting it as a viable, high performance alternative for learning intrinsically efficient policies in resource-limited settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPAN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u6761\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfMLP\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8630-50%\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c1.3-9\u500d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a(MLP)\u5b58\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u5bf9\u8bb8\u591a\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u7ed3\u6784\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4f1a\u963b\u788d\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u7f13\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u662f\u4e8b\u540e\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6539\u5584\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "SPAN\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5c42\u548c\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u79efB\u6837\u6761\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4f4e\u79e9KHRONOS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u6761\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79bb\u6563(PPO)\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8fde\u7eed(SAC)\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u53ca\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bbe\u7f6e(Minari/D4RL)\u4e2d\uff0cSPAN\u76f8\u6bd4MLP\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8630-50%\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c1.3-9\u500d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SPAN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5185\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfMLP\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing temporal graph neural networks mainly focus on learning representations of historical interactions. Despite their strong performance, these models are still purely discriminative, producing point estimates for future links and lacking an explicit mechanism to capture the uncertainty and sequential structure of future temporal interactions. In this paper, we propose SDG, a novel sequence-level diffusion framework that unifies dynamic graph learning with generative denoising. Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on various temporal graph benchmarks show that SDG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the temporal link prediction task.", "AI": {"tldr": "SDG\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u53bb\u566a\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u5e8f\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u4f46\u4ecd\u662f\u7eaf\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u672a\u6765\u94fe\u63a5\u7684\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6355\u6349\u672a\u6765\u65f6\u5e8f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSDG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u6574\u4e2a\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8054\u5408\u91cd\u6784\u6240\u6709\u4ea4\u4e92\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53bb\u566a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6307\u5bfc\u76ee\u6807\u5e8f\u5217\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u5e8f\u56fe\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSDG\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SDG\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u53bb\u566a\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we identify a key inefficiency in DLLM decoding: while computation is parallelized over token blocks, only a small subset of tokens is decodable at each diffusion step, causing most compute to be wasted on non-decodable tokens. We further observe a strong correlation between attention-derived token importance and token-wise decoding probability. Based on this insight, we propose FOCUS -- an inference system designed for DLLMs. By dynamically focusing computation on decodable tokens and evicting non-decodable ones on-the-fly, FOCUS increases the effective batch size, alleviating compute limitations and enabling scalable throughput. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FOCUS achieves up to 3.52$\\times$ throughput improvement over the production-grade engine LMDeploy, while preserving or improving generation quality across multiple benchmarks.

Existing plug-and-play diffusion posterior samplers represent physics implicitly through joint coefficient-solution modeling, requiring substantial paired supervision. In contrast, our Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS) employs a decoupled design: an unconditional diffusion learns the coefficient prior, while a neural operator explicitly models the forward PDE for guidance. This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). Theoretically, we prove that DDIS avoids the guidance attenuation failure of joint models when training data is scarce. Empirically, DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse observation, improving $l_2$ error by 11% and spectral error by 54% on average; when data is limited to 1%, DDIS maintains accuracy with 40% advantage in $l_2$ error compared to joint models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDDIS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u9006PDE\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u524d\u5411PDE\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u8870\u51cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u7cfb\u6570-\u89e3\u5efa\u6a21\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u7269\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6307\u5bfc\u8870\u51cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u6269\u6563\u9006\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff08DDIS\uff09\uff1a1\uff09\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff1b2\uff09\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u524d\u5411PDE\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b3\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u8026\u9000\u706b\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\uff08DAPS\uff09\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347l2\u8bef\u5dee11%\uff0c\u8c31\u8bef\u5dee54%\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u4ec51%\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728l2\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u4fdd\u630140%\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u907f\u514d\u6307\u5bfc\u8870\u51cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "DDIS\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9006PDE\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, transferability to aerial imagery remains unexplored. We present the first systematic benchmark evaluating five state-of-the-art OVD models on the LAE-80C aerial dataset (3,592 images, 80 categories) under strict zero-shot conditions. Our experimental protocol isolates semantic confusion from visual localization through Global, Oracle, and Single-Category inference modes. Results reveal severe domain transfer failure: the best model (OWLv2) achieves only 27.6% F1-score with 69% false positive rate. Critically, reducing vocabulary size from 80 to 3.2 classes yields 15x improvement, demonstrating that semantic confusion is the primary bottleneck. Prompt engineering strategies such as domain-specific prefixing and synonym expansion, fail to provide meaningful performance gains.

This paper investigates drunk language, i.e., text written under the influence of alcohol, as a driver for safety failures in large language models (LLMs). We investigate three mechanisms for inducing drunk language in LLMs: persona-based prompting, causal fine-tuning, and reinforcement-based post-training. When evaluated on 5 LLMs, we observe a higher susceptibility to jailbreaking on JailbreakBench (even in the presence of defences) and privacy leaks on ConfAIde, where both benchmarks are in English, as compared to the base LLMs as well as previously reported approaches. Via a robust combination of manual evaluation and LLM-based evaluators and analysis of error categories, our findings highlight a correspondence between human-intoxicated behaviour, and anthropomorphism in LLMs induced with drunk language. The simplicity and efficiency of our drunk language inducement approaches position them as potential counters for LLM safety tuning, highlighting significant risks to LLM safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\"\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\"\uff08\u9152\u7cbe\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u4e66\u5199\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u9a71\u52a8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8bf1\u5bfcLLM\u4ea7\u751f\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u9152\u7cbe\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u662f\u5426\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5931\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793aLLM\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8bf1\u5bfcLLM\u4ea7\u751f\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff1b2\uff09\u56e0\u679c\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u57285\u4e2aLLM\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528JailbreakBench\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d8a\u72f1\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ConfAIde\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u548cLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf1\u5bfc\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86LLM\u5bf9\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u591a\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u9189\u9152\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0eLLM\u5728\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf1\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297LLM\u5b89\u5168\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86LLM\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u9189\u9152\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0eLLM\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u5931\u6548\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002"}}

Shelling's theory explains how, in these settings, humans coordinate by relying on focal points: solutions or outcomes that naturally arise because they stand out in some way as salient or prominent to all players. This work studies Large Language Models (LLMs) as players in tacit coordination games, and addresses how, when, and why focal points emerge. We compare and quantify the coordination capabilities of LLMs in cooperative and competitive games for which human experiments are available. We also introduce several learning-free strategies to improve the coordination of LLMs, with themselves and with humans. On a selection of heterogeneous open-source models, including Llama, Qwen, and GPT-oss, we discover that LLMs have a remarkable capability to coordinate and often outperform humans, yet fail on common-sense coordination that involves numbers or nuanced cultural archetypes.

We propose a lightweight, semantic-aware pre-processing framework that enhances perceptual fidelity by selectively addressing these distortions. Our method integrates semantic embeddings from a vision-language model into an efficient convolutional architecture, prioritizing the preservation of perceptually significant structures. The model is trained end-to-end with a differentiable codec proxy, enabling it to mitigate artifacts from various standard codecs without modifying the existing video pipeline. During inference, the codec proxy is discarded, and SCENE operates as a standalone pre-processor, enabling real-time performance.

This work introduces Adaptive Benign Overfitting (ABO), extending the recursive least-squares (RLS) framework to this regime through a numerically stable formulation based on orthogonal-triangular updates. A QR-based exponentially weighted RLS (QR-EWRLS) algorithm is introduced, combining random Fourier feature mappings with forgetting-factor regularization to enable online adaptation under non-stationary conditions. The orthogonal decomposition prevents the numerical divergence associated with covariance-form RLS while retaining adaptability to evolving data distributions. Experiments on nonlinear synthetic time series confirm that the proposed approach maintains bounded residuals and stable condition numbers while reproducing the double-descent behavior characteristic of overparameterized models. Applications to forecasting foreign exchange and electricity demand show that ABO is highly accurate (comparable to baseline kernel methods) while achieving speed improvements of between 20 and 40 percent.

These maliciously crafted inputs can exploit LLMs, causing data leaks, unauthorized actions, or compromised outputs, for instance. As both offensive and defensive prompt injection techniques evolve quickly, a structured understanding of mitigation strategies becomes increasingly important. To address that, this work presents the first systematic literature review on prompt injection mitigation strategies, comprehending 88 studies. Building upon NIST's report on adversarial machine learning, this work contributes to the field through several avenues. First, it identifies studies beyond those documented in NIST's report and other academic reviews and surveys. Second, we propose an extension to NIST taxonomy by introducing additional categories of defenses. Third, by adopting NIST's established terminology and taxonomy as a foundation, we promote consistency and enable future researchers to build upon the standardized taxonomy proposed in this work. Finally, we provide a comprehensive catalog of the reviewed prompt injection defenses, documenting their reported quantitative effectiveness across specific LLMs and attack datasets, while also indicating which solutions are open-source and model-agnostic.

In practice, two main approaches are commonly adopted: (i) supervised or imitation learning, which requires comprehensive naturalistic driving data capturing all states that influence a vehicle's decisions and corresponding actions, and (ii) reinforcement learning (RL), where the simulated driving environment either matches or is intentionally more challenging than real-world conditions. Both methods depend on high-quality observations of real-world driving behavior, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. State-of-the-art sensors on individual vehicles can gather microscopic data, but they lack context about the surrounding conditions. Conversely, roadside sensors can capture traffic flow and other macroscopic characteristics, but they cannot associate this information with individual vehicles on a microscopic level. Motivated by this complementarity, we propose a framework that reconstructs unobserved microscopic states from macroscopic observations, using microscopic data to anchor observed vehicle behaviors, and learns a shared policy whose behavior is microscopically consistent with the partially observed trajectories and actions and macroscopically aligned with target traffic statistics when deployed population-wide. Such constrained and regularized policies promote realistic flow patterns and safe coordination with human drivers at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u5b8f\u89c2\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cd\u5efa\u5fae\u89c2\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u951a\u5b9a\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u65e2\u4e0e\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u5fae\u89c2\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u53c8\u5728\u7fa4\u4f53\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4ea4\u901a\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b8f\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b97\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b9e\u8df5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6216\u6709\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u90fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u8f66\u8f7d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73af\u5883\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u8def\u8fb9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5b8f\u89c2\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u7279\u5f81\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5173\u8054\u5230\u5177\u4f53\u8f66\u8f86\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u5b8f\u89c2\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cd\u5efa\u5fae\u89c2\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u951a\u5b9a\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b2) \u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5fae\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u4e0e\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u5f53\u7fa4\u4f53\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4ea4\u901a\u7edf\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4fc3\u8fdb\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5b8f\u89c2\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u65e2\u4fdd\u6301\u5fae\u89c2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53c8\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8f\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u89c2\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u65e2\u7b26\u5408\u4e2a\u4f53\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u53c8\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7406\u60f3\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Code available at : https://github.com/wiskott-lab/single-vs-hier-recon", "summary": "Vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are central to models that rely on high reconstruction fidelity, from neural compression to generative pipelines. Hierarchical extensions, such as VQ-VAE2, are often credited with superior reconstruction performance because they split global and local features across multiple levels. However, since higher levels derive all their information from lower levels, they should not carry additional reconstructive content beyond what the lower-level already encodes. Combined with recent advances in training objectives and quantization mechanisms, this leads us to ask whether a single-level VQ-VAE, with matched representational budget and no codebook collapse, can equal the reconstruction fidelity of its hierarchical counterpart. Although the multi-scale structure of hierarchical models may improve perceptual quality in downstream tasks, the effect of hierarchy on reconstruction accuracy, isolated from codebook utilization and overall representational capacity, remains empirically underexamined. We revisit this question by comparing a two-level VQ-VAE and a capacity-matched single-level model on high-resolution ImageNet images. Consistent with prior observations, we confirm that inadequate codebook utilization limits single-level VQ-VAEs and that overly high-dimensional embeddings destabilize quantization and increase codebook collapse. We show that lightweight interventions such as initialization from data, periodic reset of inactive codebook vectors, and systematic tuning of codebook hyperparameters significantly reduce collapse. Our results demonstrate that when representational budgets are matched, and codebook collapse is mitigated, single-level VQ-VAEs can match the reconstruction fidelity of hierarchical variants, challenging the assumption that hierarchical quantization is inherently superior for high-quality reconstructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8868\u5f81\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u907f\u514d\u7801\u672c\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42VQ-VAE\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5c42VQ-VAE\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u5b8c\u5168\u6765\u81ea\u4f4e\u5c42\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5e94\u5305\u542b\u989d\u5916\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u9694\u79bb\u7801\u672c\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u603b\u4f53\u8868\u5f81\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u91cd\u5efa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u5c42VQ-VAE\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5355\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u5728ImageNet\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff1a\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7801\u672c\u3001\u5b9a\u671f\u91cd\u7f6e\u4e0d\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7801\u672c\u5411\u91cf\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u6574\u7801\u672c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u7801\u672c\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u8868\u5f81\u9884\u7b97\u5339\u914d\u4e14\u7801\u672c\u5d29\u6e83\u5f97\u5230\u7f13\u89e3\u65f6\uff0c\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u80fd\u591f\u5339\u914d\u5206\u5c42\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u7684\u7801\u672c\u5229\u7528\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u91cf\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u7801\u672c\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u91cf\u5316\u5e76\u4e0d\u56fa\u6709\u5730\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u5c42\u91cf\u5316\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8868\u5f81\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u7801\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

We introduce JAF: Judge Agent Forest, a framework in which the judge agent conducts joint inference across a cohort of query--response pairs generated by a primary agent, rather than evaluating each in isolation. This paradigm elevates the judge from a local evaluator to a holistic learner: by simultaneously assessing related responses, the judge discerns cross-instance patterns and inconsistencies, whose aggregate feedback enables the primary agent to improve by viewing its own outputs through the judge's collective perspective.\n  Conceptually, JAF bridges belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles: overlapping in-context neighborhoods induce a knowledge-graph structure that facilitates propagation of critique, and repeated, randomized evaluations yield a robust ensemble of context-sensitive judgments. JAF can be instantiated entirely via ICL, with the judge prompted for each query using its associated primary-agent response plus a small, possibly noisy set of peer exemplars. While kNN in embedding space is a natural starting point for exemplars, this approach overlooks categorical structure, domain metadata, or nuanced distinctions accessible to modern LLMs.\n  To overcome these limitations, we develop a flexible locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that learns informative binary codes by integrating semantic embeddings, LLM-driven hash predicates, supervision from categorical labels, and relevant side information. These hash codes support efficient, interpretable, and relation-aware selection of diverse exemplars, and further optimize exploration of CoT reasoning paths.

This challenge is especially acute in mixed-motive multi-agent systems. This work focuses on cooperative resilience, the ability of agents to anticipate, resist, recover, and transform in the face of disruptions, a critical yet underexplored property in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. We study how reward function design influences resilience in mixed-motive settings and introduce a novel framework that learns reward functions from ranked trajectories, guided by a cooperative resilience metric. Agents are trained in a suite of social dilemma environments using three reward strategies: i) traditional individual reward; ii) resilience-inferred reward; and iii) hybrid that balance both. We explore three reward parameterizations-linear models, hand-crafted features, and neural networks, and employ two preference-based learning algorithms to infer rewards from behavioral rankings. Our results demonstrate that hybrid strategy significantly improve robustness under disruptions without degrading task performance and reduce catastrophic outcomes like resource overuse. These findings underscore the importance of reward design in fostering resilient cooperation, and represent a step toward developing robust multi-agent systems capable of sustaining cooperation in uncertain environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5408\u4f5c\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u673a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6392\u540d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u8ffd\u6c42\u4e2a\u4f53\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u4fdd\u969c\u96c6\u4f53\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u673a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u5f39\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u8f68\u8ff9\u6392\u540d\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u5408\u4f5c\u5f39\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u56f0\u5883\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u5956\u52b1\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4f20\u7edf\u4e2a\u4f53\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u5f39\u6027\u63a8\u65ad\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e24\u8005\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5956\u52b1\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ece\u884c\u4e3a\u6392\u540d\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u707e\u96be\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57f9\u517b\u5f39\u6027\u5408\u4f5c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u5f39\u6027\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7ef4\u6301\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

We argue that this failure reflects a fundamental mismatch: step-wise reasoning induces a form of step-wise greedy policy that is adequate for short horizons but fails in long-horizon planning, where early actions must account for delayed consequences. From this planning-centric perspective, we study LLM-based agents in deterministic, fully structured environments with explicit state transitions and evaluation signals. Our analysis reveals a core failure mode of reasoning-based policies: locally optimal choices induced by step-wise scoring lead to early myopic commitments that are systematically amplified over time and difficult to recover from. We introduce FLARE (Future-aware Lookahead with Reward Estimation) as a minimal instantiation of future-aware planning to enforce explicit lookahead, value propagation, and limited commitment in a single model, allowing downstream outcomes to influence early decisions. Across multiple benchmarks, agent frameworks, and LLM backbones, FLARE consistently improves task performance and planning-level behavior, frequently allowing LLaMA-8B with FLARE to outperform GPT-4o with standard step-by-step reasoning.

Most classical methods, e.g., Dawid-Skene or (weighted) majority voting, assume annotators are conditionally independent given the true label $Y\\in\\{0,1\\}$, an assumption often violated by LLM judges due to shared data, architectures, prompts, and failure modes. Ignoring such dependencies can yield miscalibrated posteriors and even confidently incorrect predictions. We study label aggregation through a hierarchy of dependence-aware models based on Ising graphical models and latent factors. For class-dependent Ising models, the Bayes log-odds is generally quadratic in votes; for class-independent couplings, it reduces to a linear weighted vote with correlation-adjusted parameters.

Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled substantial progress in automated veracity assessment, including automated fact-checking and claim verification systems. Typical veracity assessment pipelines break down complex claims into sub-claims, retrieve external evidence, and then apply LLM reasoning to assess veracity. However, existing methods often treat evidence retrieval as a static, isolated step and do not effectively manage or reuse retrieved evidence across claims. In this work, we propose MERMAID, a memory-enhanced multi-agent veracity assessment framework that tightly couples the retrieval and reasoning processes. MERMAID integrates agent-driven search, structured knowledge representations, and a persistent memory module within a Reason-Action style iterative process, enabling dynamic evidence acquisition and cross-claim evidence reuse. By retaining retrieved evidence in an evidence memory, the framework reduces redundant searches and improves verification efficiency and consistency. We evaluate MERMAID on three fact-checking benchmarks and two claim-verification datasets using multiple LLMs, including GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families.

A sequence of improvements through the 1980s culminated in a lower bound of $0.824$, with no substantial progress reported over the past three decades. Recent advances in LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on contest-level mathematical problems, yet their potential for addressing open, research-level questions remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a novel AI system for obtaining tighter lower bounds on the Steiner ratio. Rather than directly prompting LLMs to solve the conjecture, we task them with generating rule-constrained geometric lemmas implemented as executable code. These lemmas are then used to construct a collection of specialized functions, which we call verification functions, that yield theoretically certified lower bounds of the Steiner ratio. Through progressive lemma refinement driven by reflection, the system establishes a new certified lower bound of 0.8559 for the Steiner ratio.

We give the first fully amortized variational approximation to the tempered posterior family $p_\u03b2(\u03b8\\mid x) \\propto \u03c0(\u03b8)\\,p(x \\mid \u03b8)^\u03b2$ by training a single $(x,\u03b2)$-conditioned neural posterior estimator $q_\u03c6(\u03b8\\mid x,\u03b2)$ that enables sampling in a single forward pass, without simulator calls or inference-time MCMC. We introduce two complementary training routes: (i) synthesize off-manifold samples $(\u03b8,x) \\sim \u03c0(\u03b8)\\,p(x \\mid \u03b8)^\u03b2$ and (ii) reweight a fixed base dataset $\u03c0(\u03b8)\\,p(x \\mid \u03b8)$ using self-normalized importance sampling (SNIS). We show that the SNIS-weighted objective provides a consistent forward-KL fit to the tempered posterior with finite weight variance. Across four standard simulation-based inference (SBI) benchmarks, including the chaotic Lorenz-96 system, our $\u03b2$-amortized estimator achieves competitive posterior approximations in standard two-sample metrics, matching non-amortized MCMC-based power-posterior samplers over a wide range of temperatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u644a\u9500\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4e2a(x,\u03b2)\u6761\u4ef6\u795e\u7ecf\u540e\u9a8c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e7f\u4e49\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u6e29\u5ea6\u5316\u540e\u9a8c\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8c03\u7528\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u65f6MCMC\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e7f\u4e49\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684MCMC\u6216SDE\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u03b2\u503c\u91cd\u65b0\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4e2a(x,\u03b2)\u6761\u4ef6\u795e\u7ecf\u540e\u9a8c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668q_\u03c6(\u03b8|x,\u03b2)\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1)\u5408\u6210\u79bb\u6d41\u5f62\u6837\u672c(\u03b8,x)\u223c\u03c0(\u03b8)p(x|\u03b8)^\u03b2\uff1b2)\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u56fa\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u03c0(\u03b8)p(x|\u03b8)\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6df7\u6c8cLorenz-96\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u03b2\u644a\u9500\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4e24\u6837\u672c\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5728\u5bbd\u6e29\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5339\u914d\u975e\u644a\u9500MCMC\u529f\u7387\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u6e29\u5ea6\u5316\u540e\u9a8c\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u644a\u9500\u53d8\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Real-world preference corpora are heterogeneous: they mix high-signal, objective failures (for example, safety, factuality, instruction violations) with low-signal or subjective distinctions (for example, style), and also include label noise. We introduce our method, SP2DPO (Semantic Per-Pair DPO), a generalization that replaces the global temperature with an instance-specific schedule beta_i pre-decided offline from structured semantic-gap annotations (category, magnitude, confidence) produced by teacher language models. We instantiate this procedure on the UltraFeedback preference corpus (59,960 pairs), enabling large-scale construction of an auditable beta_i artifact, and incur zero training-time overhead: the inner-loop optimizer remains standard DPO with beta set per pair. We focus our empirical study on AlpacaEval 2.0, reporting both raw win rate and length-controlled win rate. Across four open-weight, instruction-tuned student backbones (4B-8B), SP2DPO is competitive with a tuned global-beta DPO baseline and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 length-controlled win rate on two of four backbones, while avoiding per-model beta sweeps.

However, we identify a significant limitation we term ''Spectral Rigidity'': standard RoPE utilizes a fixed geometric decay ($\u03b8^{-i}$) optimized for local syntactic coherence, which fails to capture the long-range, periodic structures inherent in recursive logic and algorithmic reasoning. This results in a ''Structure Gap'', where models trained on shallow reasoning chains fail to extrapolate to deeper recursive steps. In this work, we introduce Bifocal Attention, an architectural paradigm that decouples positional encoding into two distinct modalities: Geometric Eyes (Standard RoPE) for precise token-level manipulation, and Spectral Eyes (Learnable Harmonic Operators) for tracking long-range recursive depth. We propose a novel training protocol, Spectral Evolution, which initializes positional frequencies as static geometric parameters but allows them to evolve via gradient descent into a harmonic basis optimized for the specific algorithmic topology of the task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faBifocal Attention\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u773c\u548c\u8c31\u773c\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u51b3RoPE\u5728\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6RoPE\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u9002\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u53e5\u6cd5\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u9012\u5f52\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d45\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5916\u63a8\u5230\u66f4\u6df1\u9012\u5f52\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\"\u7ed3\u6784\u9e3f\u6c9f\"\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBifocal Attention\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\uff1a\u51e0\u4f55\u773c\uff08\u6807\u51c6RoPE\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u7684token\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8c31\u773c\uff08\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u8c10\u6ce2\u7b97\u5b50\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u9012\u5f52\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51faSpectral Evolution\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9891\u7387\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5141\u8bb8\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6f14\u5316\u4e3a\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8c10\u6ce2\u57fa", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u58f0\u79f0\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RoPE\u7684\"\u8c31\u521a\u6027\"\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\"\u7ed3\u6784\u9e3f\u6c9f\"\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1", "conclusion": "Bifocal Attention\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u8c31\u6f14\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e3aLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5c40\u90e8\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u9012\u5f52\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0"}}

Existing discrete diffusion and flow-based methods rely on reversing fixed corruption processes or following prescribed probability paths, which can force generation through low-likelihood regions and require countless sampling steps. We introduce Minimal-action discrete Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge Matching (MadSBM), a rate-based generative framework for peptide design that formulates generation as a controlled continuous-time Markov process on the amino-acid edit graph. To yield probability trajectories that remain near high-likelihood sequence neighborhoods throughout generation, MadSBM 1) defines generation relative to a biologically informed reference process derived from pre-trained protein language model logits and 2) learns a time-dependent control field that biases transition rates to produce low-action transport paths from a masked prior to the data distribution. We finally introduce guidance to the MadSBM sampling procedure towards a specific functional objective, expanding the design space of therapeutic peptides; to our knowledge, this represents the first-ever application of discrete classifier guidance to Schr\u00f6dinger bridge-based generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "MadSBM\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u79bb\u6563\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\u5339\u914d\u7684\u80bd\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\u7f16\u8f91\u56fe\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f4e\u4f3c\u7136\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u9000\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6216\u9884\u8bbe\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4f4e\u4f3c\u7136\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u80bd\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u9700\u8981\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u5316\u5b66\u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u6216\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578blogits\u5b9a\u4e49\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u53c2\u8003\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b2) \u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a7\u5236\u573a\uff0c\u504f\u7f6e\u8f6c\u79fb\u7387\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u4ece\u63a9\u7801\u5148\u9a8c\u5230\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4f4e\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u8def\u5f84\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u529f\u80fd\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "MadSBM\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u9ad8\u4f3c\u7136\u5e8f\u5217\u90bb\u57df\u9644\u8fd1\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4f4e\u4f3c\u7136\u533a\u57df\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "MadSBM\u4e3a\u80bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6cbb\u7597\u6027\u80bd\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

As this typically involves processing sensitive personal information, releasing either the trained model or generated synthetic datasets can still pose privacy risks. Yet, recent research, commercial deployments, and privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) largely assess anonymity at the level of an individual dataset.\n  In this paper, we rethink anonymity claims about synthetic data from a model-centric perspective and argue that meaningful assessments must account for the capabilities and properties of the underlying generative model and be grounded in state-of-the-art privacy attacks. This perspective better reflects real-world products and deployments, where trained models are often readily accessible for interaction or querying. We interpret the GDPR's definitions of personal data and anonymization under such access assumptions to identify the types of identifiability risks that must be mitigated and map them to privacy attacks across different threat settings. We then argue that synthetic data techniques alone do not ensure sufficient anonymization. Finally, we compare the two mechanisms most commonly used alongside synthetic data -- Differential Privacy (DP) and Similarity-based Privacy Metrics (SBPMs) -- and argue that while DP can offer robust protections against identifiability risks, SBPMs lack adequate safeguards. Overall, our work connects regulatory notions of identifiability with model-centric privacy attacks, enabling more responsible and trustworthy regulatory assessment of synthetic data systems by researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u533f\u540d\u6027\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fc5\u987b\u8003\u8651\u5e95\u5c42\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u5c06GDPR\u7684\u533f\u540d\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u5047\u8bbe\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6280\u672f\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5145\u5206\u533f\u540d\u5316\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9690\u79c1\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u524d\u8005\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u800c\u540e\u8005\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u505c\u7559\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u6216\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u5546\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u548cGDPR\u7b49\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u5bf9\u533f\u540d\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u533f\u540d\u6027\u4e3b\u5f20\uff0c\u5c06GDPR\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u548c\u533f\u540d\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u5047\u8bbe\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5fc5\u987b\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u5a01\u80c1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u5206\u6790\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9690\u79c1\u6307\u6807\u4e24\u79cd\u5e38\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6280\u672f\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5145\u5206\u7684\u533f\u540d\u5316\uff1b\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u9488\u5bf9\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u800c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9690\u79c1\u6307\u6807\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u4fdd\u969c\u63aa\u65bd\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u533f\u540d\u6027\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u662f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9690\u79c1\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u3001\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u66f4\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

In particular, a transformation technique which leverages the Cressie-Read discrepancy criterion under moment restrictions is used for summarizing the learned statistics between the observation data and the simulation outputs, while preserving the statistical power of the inference. Here, such a transformation of data-to-learned summary statistics also allows the simulation outputs to be conditioned on the observation data, so that the inference task can be performed over certain sample sets of the observation data that are considered as an empirical relevance or believed to be particular importance. Moreover, the simulation-based inference framework discussed in this paper can be extended further, and thus handling weakly dependent observation data. Finally, we remark that such an inference framework is suitable for implementation in distributed computing, i.e., computational tasks involving both the data-to-learned summary statistics and the Bayesian inferencing problem can be posed as a unified distributed inference problem that will exploit distributed optimization and MCMC algorithms for supporting large datasets associated with complex simulation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6458\u8981\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5904\u7406\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u95ed\u5f0f\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Cressie-Read\u5dee\u5f02\u51c6\u5219\u8f6c\u6362\u6570\u636e\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u95ed\u5f0f\u5f62\u5f0f\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6458\u8981\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Cressie-Read\u5dee\u5f02\u51c6\u5219\u5728\u77e9\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8f6c\u6362\u6570\u636e\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5141\u8bb8\u5c06\u6a21\u62df\u8f93\u51fa\u6761\u4ef6\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u548cMCMC\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u95ed\u5f0f\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u529f\u6548\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u4e0e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002"}}

A line of recent work has studied samplers for discrete diffusion models, such as tau-leaping and Euler solver. However, these samplers require a large number of iterations to control discretization error, since the transition rates are frozen in time and evaluated at the initial state within each time interval. Moreover, theoretical results for these samplers often require boundedness conditions of the transition rate or they focus on a specific type of source distributions. To address those limitations, we establish non-asymptotic discretization error bounds for those samplers without any restriction on transition rates and source distributions, under the framework of discrete flow models. Furthermore, by analyzing a one-step lower bound of the Euler sampler, we propose two corrected samplers: \\textit{time-corrected sampler} and \\textit{location-corrected sampler}, which can reduce the discretization error of tau-leaping and Euler solver with almost no additional computational cost. We rigorously show that the location-corrected sampler has a lower iteration complexity than existing parallel samplers. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method by demonstrating improved generation quality and reduced inference time on both simulation and text-to-image generation tasks.

Evolutionary Computation methods are generally advantaged in solving DOPs since they resemble dynamic biological evolution. However, existing evolutionary dynamic optimization methods rely heavily on human-crafted adaptive strategy to detect environment variation in DOPs, and then adapt the searching strategy accordingly. These hand-crafted strategies may perform ineffectively at out-of-box scenarios. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-assisted approach to enable automated variation detection and self-adaption in evolutionary algorithms. This is achieved by borrowing the bi-level learning-to-optimize idea from recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization works. We use a deep Q-network as optimization dynamics detector and searching strategy adapter: It is fed as input with current-step optimization state and then dictates desired control parameters to underlying evolutionary algorithms for next-step optimization. The learning objective is to maximize the expected performance gain across a problem distribution.

However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of \"easy\" versus \"hard\" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions.

However, existing literature has primarily focused on closed-set tasks, such as visual question answering with predefined options or fixed-category classification. This paper considers selective prediction for visual language foundation models, addressing a taxonomy of tasks ranging from closed to open set and from finite to unbounded vocabularies, as in image captioning. We seek training-free approaches of low-complexity, applicable to any foundation model and consider methods based on external vision-language model embeddings, like CLIP. This is denoted as Plug-and-Play Selective Prediction (PaPSP). We identify two key challenges: (1) instability of the visual-language representations, leading to high variance in image-text embeddings, and (2) poor calibration of similarity scores. To address these issues, we propose a memory augmented PaPSP (MA-PaPSP) model, which augments PaPSP with a retrieval dataset of image-text pairs. This is leveraged to reduce embedding variance by averaging retrieved nearest-neighbor pairs and is complemented by the use of contrastive normalization to improve score calibration. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we show that MA-PaPSP outperforms PaPSP and other selective prediction baselines for selective captioning, image-text matching, and fine-grained classification.

A critical design choice is the placement of normalization layers, leading to a fundamental trade-off: the ``PreNorm'' architecture ensures training stability at the cost of potential performance degradation in deep models, while the ``PostNorm'' architecture offers strong performance but suffers from severe training instability. In this work, we propose SpanNorm, a novel technique designed to resolve this dilemma by integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Structurally, SpanNorm establishes a clean residual connection that spans the entire transformer block to stabilize signal propagation, while employing a PostNorm-style computation that normalizes the aggregated output to enhance model performance. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that SpanNorm, combined with a principled scaling strategy, maintains bounded signal variance throughout the network, preventing the gradient issues that plague PostNorm models, and also alleviating the representation collapse of PreNorm.

They involve a large number of parameters for model updates, being prone to the overfitting problem. To the best of our knowledge, none has explored the strength of the foundation model, having strong generalization power to be quickly adapted to downstream tasks. This paper proposes the MIxup FOundation MOdel (MIFOMO) for CDFSL of HSI classifications. MIFOMO is built upon the concept of a remote sensing (RS) foundation model, pre-trained across a large scale of RS problems, thus featuring generalizable features. The notion of coalescent projection (CP) is introduced to quickly adapt the foundation model to downstream tasks while freezing the backbone network. The concept of mixup domain adaptation (MDM) is proposed to address the extreme domain discrepancy problem. Last but not least, the label smoothing concept is implemented to cope with noisy pseudo-label problems. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of MIFOMO, where it beats prior arts with up to 14% margin.

In this work, we investigate whether smaller models can serve as efficient evaluators by leveraging internal representations instead of surface generation. We uncover a consistent empirical pattern: small LMs, despite with weak generative ability, encode rich evaluative signals in their hidden states. This motivates us to propose the Semantic Capacity Asymmetry Hypothesis: evaluation requires significantly less semantic capacity than generation and can be grounded in intermediate representations, suggesting that evaluation does not necessarily need to rely on large-scale generative models but can instead leverage latent features from smaller ones. Our findings motivate a paradigm shift from LLM-as-a-Judge to Representation-as-a-Judge, a decoding-free evaluation strategy that probes internal model structure rather than relying on prompted output.

Protecting user privacy with minimal accuracy loss is a fundamental task in the data analysis and mining community. In this paper, we focus on regression tasks under $\u03b5$-label differential privacy guarantees. Some existing methods for regression with $\u03b5$-label differential privacy, such as the RR-On-Bins mechanism, discretized the output space into finite bins and then applied RR algorithm. To efficiently determine these finite bins, the authors rounded the original responses down to integer values. However, such operations does not align well with real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we model both original and randomized responses as continuous random variables, avoiding discretization entirely. Our novel approach estimates an optimal interval for randomized responses and introduces new algorithms designed for scenarios where a prior is either known or unknown. Additionally, we prove that our algorithm, RPWithPrior, guarantees $\u03b5$-label differential privacy.

Existing pruning methods suffer from two primary limitations. First, reliance on dataset-specific calibration introduces significant data dependency and computational overhead. Second, being predominantly static, they fail to account for the evolving subset of knowledge neurons in LLMs during autoregressive generation as the context evolves. To address this, we introduce DART, i.e., Dynamic Attention-Guided Runtime Tracing), a lightweight, training-free method that performs on-the-fly context-based pruning. DART monitors shifts in attention score distributions to infer context changes, dynamically updating neuron-level masks to retain salient parameters. Across ten benchmarks, DART outperforms prior dynamic baseline, achieving accuracy gains of up to 14.5% on LLAMA-3.1-8B at 70% FFN sparsity. Furthermore, DART achieves up to 3x better ROUGE-L scores with respect to static-masked pruning on summarization tasks, with its performance comparable to the original dense models. We conclusively demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively adapts to diverse semantic contexts, preserves model capabilities across both general and domain-specific tasks while running at less than 10MBs of memory for LLAMA-3.1-8B(16GBs) with 0.1% FLOPs overhead.

To tackle this challenge, this paper unveils the root causes of reward hacking and overconfidence in current RL paradigms incorporating uncertainty-based rewards, based on which we propose the UnCertainty-Aware Policy Optimization (UCPO) framework. UCPO employs Ternary Advantage Decoupling to separate and independently normalize deterministic and uncertain rollouts, thereby eliminating advantage bias.

A wide range of methodologies have been developed for this task. This article reviews and compares several representative approaches spanning classical nonparametric methods and modern generative models. We begin with the single-index method of Hall and Yao (2005), which estimates the conditional distribution through a dimension-reducing index and nonparametric smoothing of the resulting one-dimensional cumulative conditional distribution function. We then examine the basis-expansion approaches, including FlexCode (Izbicki and Lee, 2017) and DeepCDE (Dalmasso et al., 2020), which convert conditional density estimation into a set of nonparametric regression problems. In addition, we discuss two recent generative simulation-based methods that leverage modern deep generative architectures: the generative conditional distribution sampler (Zhou et al., 2023) and the conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (Fu et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025).

We investigate the mechanisms underlying these gains through a dynamical analysis of a nonlinear phase retrieval model with anisotropic Gaussian inputs, equivalent to training a two-layer neural network with the quadratic activation and fixed second-layer weights. Focusing on a spiked covariance setting where the dominant variance direction is orthogonal to the signal, we show that gradient descent (GD) suffers from a variance-induced misalignment: during the early escaping stage, the high-variance but uninformative spike direction is multiplicatively amplified, degrading alignment with the true signal under strong anisotropy. In contrast, spectral gradient descent (SpecGD) removes this spike amplification effect, leading to stable alignment and accelerated noise contraction. Numerical experiments confirm the theory and show that these phenomena persist under broader anisotropic covariances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4f4d\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u8c31\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff09\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u4f46\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u800c\u8c31\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u79cd\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6536\u7f29\u3002", "motivation": "\u8c31\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff09\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u8c31\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4f4d\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5177\u6709\u4e8c\u6b21\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u4e24\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5c16\u5cf0\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65b9\u5dee\u65b9\u5411\u4e0e\u4fe1\u53f7\u6b63\u4ea4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u8c31\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u9003\u79bb\u9636\u6bb5\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u4f46\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5c16\u5cf0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f3a\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4e0b\u3002\u800c\u8c31\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u79cd\u5c16\u5cf0\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6536\u7f29\u3002\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c31\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u4e8e\u80fd\u591f\u6d88\u9664\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e2d\u7531\u65b9\u5dee\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u4e22\u5f03\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u566a\u58f0\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u3002"}}

However, existing VLMs remain notably weak at understanding negated clinical statements, largely due to contrastive alignment objectives that treat negation as a minor linguistic variation rather than a meaning-inverting operator. In multi-label settings, prompt-based InfoNCE fine-tuning further reinforces easy-positive image-prompt alignments, limiting effective learning of disease absence. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate vision-language alignment as a conditional semantic comparison problem, which is instantiated through a bi-directional multiple-choice learning framework(Bi-MCQ). By jointly training Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image MCQ tasks with affirmative, negative, and mixed prompts, our method implements fine-tuning as conditional semantic comparison instead of global similarity maximization. We further introduce direction-specific Cross-Attention fusion modules to address asymmetric cues required by bi-directional reasoning and reduce alignment interference.

For training efficiency, rollouts are typically generated in an off-policy manner using an older sampling policy and then used to update the current target policy. To correct the resulting discrepancy between the sampling and target policies, most existing RL objectives rely on a token-level importance sampling ratio, primarily due to its computational simplicity and numerical stability. However, we observe that token-level correction often leads to unstable training dynamics when the degree of off-policyness is large. In this paper, we revisit LLM policy optimization under off-policy conditions and show that the theoretically rigorous correction term is the prefix importance ratio, and that relaxing it to a token-level approximation can induce instability in RL post-training. To stabilize LLM optimization under large off-policy drift, we propose a simple yet effective objective, Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO). MinPRO replaces the unstable cumulative prefix ratio with a non-cumulative surrogate based on the minimum token-level ratio observed in the preceding prefix. Extensive experiments on both dense and mixture-of-experts LLMs, across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrate that MinPRO substantially improves training stability and peak performance in off-policy regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMinPRO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u7f00\u4e2d\u6700\u5c0ftoken\u7ea7\u6bd4\u7387\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u524d\u7f00\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u56e0\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f83\u65e7\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u5f53\u524d\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u4e3a\u7ea0\u6b63\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56token\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5728\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMinPRO\uff08Minimum Prefix Ratio\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u7f00\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684token\u7ea7\u6700\u5c0f\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u975e\u7d2f\u79ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u9879\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u524d\u7f00\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9aLLM\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6LLM\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMinPRO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5cf0\u503c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MinPRO\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u6bd4\u7387\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we propose FaceDefense, an enhanced proactive defense framework against diffusion-based face swapping. Our method introduces a new diffusion loss to strengthen the defensive efficacy of adversarial examples, and employs a directional facial attribute editing to restore perturbation-induced distortions, thereby enhancing visual imperceptibility.

Traditional approaches, such as rank-constrained optimization and semidefinite programming, enforce geometric constraints but often struggle under sparse or noisy conditions. This paper introduces a hierarchical Bayesian framework that places structured priors directly on the latent point set generating the EDM, naturally embedding geometric constraints.

While recent foundation models enable rich semantic representations across vision, audio, and language, retrieving relevant observations from massive archives remains challenging due to the computational cost of high-dimensional similarity search. In this work, we introduce compact hypercube embeddings for fast text-based wildlife observation retrieval, a framework that enables efficient text-based search over large-scale wildlife image and audio databases using compact binary representations. Building on the cross-view code alignment hashing framework, we extend lightweight hashing beyond a single-modality setup to align natural language descriptions with visual or acoustic observations in a shared Hamming space. Our approach leverages pretrained wildlife foundation models, including BioCLIP and BioLingual, and adapts them efficiently for hashing using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We evaluate our method on large-scale benchmarks, including iNaturalist2024 for text-to-image retrieval and iNatSounds2024 for text-to-audio retrieval, as well as multiple soundscape datasets to assess robustness under domain shift. Results show that retrieval using discrete hypercube embeddings achieves competitive, and in several cases superior, performance compared to continuous embeddings, while drastically reducing memory and search cost. Moreover, we observe that the hashing objective consistently improves the underlying encoder representations, leading to stronger retrieval and zero-shot generalization. These results demonstrate that binary, language-based retrieval enables scalable and efficient search over large wildlife archives for biodiversity monitoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7d27\u51d1\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u5d4c\u5165\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u89c2\u6d4b\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u76d1\u6d4b\u5e73\u53f0\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\u9f50\u54c8\u5e0c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u54c8\u5e0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u6c49\u660e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9/\u542c\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08BioCLIP\u548cBioLingual\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u8fdb\u884c\u54c8\u5e0c\u9002\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728iNaturalist2024\uff08\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u548ciNatSounds2024\uff08\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u9891\uff09\u7b49\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u6bd4\u8fde\u7eed\u5d4c\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u3002\u54c8\u5e0c\u76ee\u6807\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u5e95\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u6863\u6848\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u8868\u793a\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "We introduce a rank-statistic approximation of $f$-divergences that avoids explicit density-ratio estimation by working directly with the distribution of ranks. For a resolution parameter $K$, we map the mismatch between two univariate distributions $\u03bc$ and $\u03bd$ to a rank histogram on $\\{ 0, \\ldots, K\\}$ and measure its deviation from uniformity via a discrete $f$-divergence, yielding a rank-statistic divergence estimator. We prove that the resulting estimator of the divergence is monotone in $K$, is always a lower bound of the true $f$-divergence, and we establish quantitative convergence rates for $K\\to\\infty$ under mild regularity of the quantile-domain density ratio. To handle high-dimensional data, we define the sliced rank-statistic $f$-divergence by averaging the univariate construction over random projections, and we provide convergence results for the sliced limit as well. We also derive finite-sample deviation bounds along with asymptotic normality results for the estimator.

Submitted to ICML 2026. 8 pages main text, plus appendix", "summary": "Anomaly detection is often formulated under the assumption that abnormality is an intrinsic property of an observation, independent of context. This assumption breaks down in many real-world settings, where the same object or action may be normal or anomalous depending on latent contextual factors (e.g., running on a track versus on a highway). We revisit \\emph{contextual anomaly detection}, classically defined as context-dependent abnormality, and operationalize it in the visual domain, where anomaly labels depend on subject--context compatibility rather than intrinsic appearance. To enable systematic study of this setting, we introduce CAAD-3K, a benchmark that isolates contextual anomalies by controlling subject identity while varying context. We further propose a conditional compatibility learning framework that leverages vision--language representations to model subject--context relationships under limited supervision. Our method substantially outperforms existing approaches on CAAD-3K and achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec-AD and VisA, demonstrating that modeling context dependence complements traditional structural anomaly detection.

To realize this, we present \\method{}, the first diffusion-based speech-text language model supporting both understanding and generation, unifying discrete text and tokenized speech under a single masked diffusion framework. Unlike autoregressive approaches, \\method{} jointly generates reasoning traces and speech tokens through iterative denoising, with modality-specific masking schedules.

Unfortunately, existing approaches often suffer from limited reconstruction fidelity due to the loss of high-frequency details. In this work, we present the DINO Spherical Autoencoder (DINO-SAE), a framework that bridges semantic representation and pixel-level reconstruction. Our key insight is that semantic information in contrastive representations is primarily encoded in the direction of feature vectors, while forcing strict magnitude matching can hinder the encoder from preserving fine-grained details. To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention. Furthermore, leveraging the observation that SSL-based foundation model representations intrinsically lie on a hypersphere, we employ Riemannian Flow Matching to train a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly on this spherical latent manifold. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, reaching 0.37 rFID and 26.2 dB PSNR, while maintaining strong semantic alignment to the pretrained VFM.

These methods typically employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt LLMs to recommendation scenarios, and utilize beam search during inference to efficiently retrieve $B$ top-ranked recommended items. However, we identify a critical training-inference inconsistency: while SFT optimizes the overall probability of positive items, it does not guarantee that such items will be retrieved by beam search even if they possess high overall probabilities. Due to the greedy pruning mechanism, beam search can prematurely discard a positive item once its prefix probability is insufficient.\n  To address this inconsistency, we propose BEAR (Beam-SEarch-Aware Regularization), a novel fine-tuning objective that explicitly accounts for beam search behavior during training. Rather than directly simulating beam search for each instance during training, which is computationally prohibitive, BEAR enforces a relaxed necessary condition: each token in a positive item must rank within the top-$B$ candidate tokens at each decoding step.

However, despite their ubiquitous use, the exact mechanisms underlying their outstanding performance remain unclear. Different methods for LLM explainability exist, and many are, as a method, not fully understood themselves. We started with the question of how linguistic abstraction emerges in LLMs, aiming to detect it across different LLM modules (attention heads and input embeddings). For this, we used methods well-established in the literature: (1) probing for token-level relational structures, and (2) feature-mapping using embeddings as carriers of human-interpretable properties.\n  Both attempts failed for different methodological reasons: Attention-based explanations collapsed once we tested the core assumption that later-layer representations still correspond to tokens. Property-inference methods applied to embeddings also failed because their high predictive scores were driven by methodological artifacts and dataset structure rather than meaningful semantic knowledge. These failures matter because both techniques are widely treated as evidence for what LLMs supposedly understand, yet our results show such conclusions are unwarranted.

Integrating Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in addressing \"long-tail\" scenarios.

To overcome this limitation, we present MTDrive, a multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to iteratively refine trajectories based on environmental feedback. MTDrive introduces Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (mtGRPO), which mitigates reward sparsity by computing relative advantages across turns. We further construct an interactive trajectory understanding dataset from closed-loop simulation to support multi-turn training. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our multi-turn reasoning paradigm.

Although they achieve competitive performance on several tasks, a substantial gap remains in open-ended text generation. We hypothesize that one cause of this gap is that strict positional prediction makes MDLM decoding highly sensitive to token misalignment, and we show through controlled interventions that a one-position shift can severely disrupt semantics. This observation suggests that enforcing strict positional supervision during training is misaligned with the irreversible denoising dynamics of MDLM decoding. Motivated by this mismatch, we adopt an alignment-flexible supervision strategy during fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce a special token <slack> via the connectionist temporal classification objective. We apply this approach to the widely used MDLM model and conduct experiments on five open-ended text generation benchmarks.

Exact smoothing via Doob's $h$-transform is intractable for general non-linear dynamics, while particle-based methods degrade in high dimensions. We propose Neural Backward Filtering Forward Guiding (NBFFG), a unified framework for both discrete transitions and continuous diffusions. Our method constructs a variational posterior by leveraging an auxiliary linear-Gaussian process. This auxiliary process yields a closed-form backward filter that serves as a ``guide'', steering the generative path toward high-likelihood regions.

This setting, which arises naturally in active learning and reweighting schemes, introduces intricate statistical dependencies across samples and fundamentally distinguishes the problem from classical single-stage ERM analyses. For linear models trained with a broad class of convex losses on Gaussian mixture data, we derive a sharp asymptotic characterization of the test error in the high-dimensional regime where the sample size and ambient dimension scale proportionally. Our results provide explicit, fully asymptotic predictions for the performance of the second-stage estimator despite the reuse of data and the presence of prediction-dependent losses. We apply this theory to revisit a well-studied pool-based active learning problem, removing oracle and sample-splitting assumptions made in prior work. We uncover a fundamental tradeoff in how the labeling budget should be allocated across stages, and demonstrate a double-descent behavior of the test error driven purely by data selection, rather than model size or sample count.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ecf\u9a8c\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316(ERM)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u63a8\u5bfc\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6e10\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u6790", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u51fa\u73b0\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5ERM\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u635f\u5931\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u5355\u9636\u6bb5ERM\u5206\u6790\u6709\u672c\u8d28\u533a\u522b", "method": "\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u51f8\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6e10\u8fd1\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6e10\u8fd1\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7f29\u653e", "result": "\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u6e10\u8fd1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6c60\u5f0f\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684oracle\u548c\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7531\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bef\u5dee\u53cc\u4e0b\u964d\u884c\u4e3a", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u635f\u5931\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5ERM\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd"}}

Developing safeguards for LLMs inspired by this mechanism might be particularly helpful for their application in high-stakes tasks such as automating compliance with data privacy laws. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Epistemic Fallback (DEF), a dynamic safety protocol for improving an LLM's inference-time defenses against deceptive attacks that make use of maliciously perturbed policy texts. Through various levels of one-sentence textual cues, DEF nudges LLMs to flag inconsistencies, refuse compliance, and fallback to their parametric knowledge upon encountering perturbed policy texts. Using globally recognized legal policies such as HIPAA and GDPR, our empirical evaluations report that DEF effectively improves the capability of frontier LLMs to detect and refuse perturbed versions of policies, with DeepSeek-R1 achieving a 100% detection rate in one setting.

Deployed language models almost never follow it, instead being exposed through a single API endpoint that serves all users and requests. This gap exists not because least privilege would be unhelpful; deployments would benefit greatly from reducing unnecessary capability exposure. The real obstacle is definitional and mechanistic: what does \"access\" mean inside a language model, and how can we enforce it without retraining or deploying multiple models? We take inspiration from least privilege in computer systems and define a class of models called least-privilege language models, where privilege is reachable internal computation during the forward pass. In this view, lowering privilege literally shrinks the model's accessible function class, as opposed to denying access via learned policies. We formalize deployment-time control as a monitor-allocator-enforcer stack, separating (i) request-time signals, (ii) a decision rule that allocates privilege, and (iii) an inference-time mechanism that selects privilege. We then propose Nested Least-Privilege Networks, a shape-preserving, rank-indexed intervention that provides a smooth, reversible control knob. We show that this knob yields policy-usable privilege-utility frontiers and enables selective suppression of targeted capabilities with limited collateral degradation across various policies. Most importantly, we argue for a new deployment paradigm that challenges the premise that language models can only be controlled at the output level.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\u6743\u9650\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u5b9e\u65bd\u6700\u5c0f\u6743\u9650\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u90e8\u7f72\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u8fdd\u53cd\u6700\u5c0f\u6743\u9650\u5b89\u5168\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u7528\u6237\u548c\u8bf7\u6c42\u90fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00API\u7aef\u70b9\u66b4\u9732\u5168\u90e8\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6700\u5c0f\u6743\u9650\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u66b4\u9732\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u5b9e\u65bd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5d4c\u5957\u6700\u5c0f\u6743\u9650\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4fdd\u6301\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u6309\u79e9\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e73\u6ed1\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65cb\u94ae\u3002\u5c06\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u76d1\u63a7-\u5206\u914d-\u6267\u884c\u4e09\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u63a7\u5236\u65cb\u94ae\u4ea7\u751f\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u6743\u9650-\u6548\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6291\u5236\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u9650\u5236\u9644\u5e26\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6311\u6218\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u9762\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5c0f\u6743\u9650\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

However, these approaches typically utilize a diffusion prior trained at a single scale, ignoring the hierarchical scale structure of image data. In this work, we propose to decompose images into Laplacian pyramid scales and train separate diffusion priors for each frequency band.

A defining feature of masked SSL is that training aggregates predictions across many masking patterns, giving rise to a joint, matrix-valued predictor rather than a single vector-valued estimator. This object encodes how coordinates condition on one another and poses new analytical challenges. We develop a precise high-dimensional analysis of masked modeling objectives in the proportional regime where the number of samples scales with the ambient dimension. Our results provide explicit expressions for the generalization error and characterize the spectral structure of the learned predictor, revealing how masked modeling extracts structure from data. For spiked covariance models, we show that the joint predictor undergoes a Baik--Ben Arous--P\u00e9ch\u00e9 (BBP)-type phase transition, identifying when masked SSL begins to recover latent signals.

We partially address this gap for node regression with graph-based errors-in-variables models under simultaneous covariate and edge corruption: responses are generated from latent node-level covariates, but only noise-perturbed versions of the latent covariates are observed; and the sample graph is a random geometric graph created from the node covariates but contaminated by independent Erd\u0151s--R\u00e9nyi edges. We propose and analyze a carefully designed, task-specific GAT that constructs denoised proxy features for regression. We prove that regressing the response variables on the proxies achieves lower error asymptotically in (a) estimating the regression coefficient compared to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator on the noisy node covariates, and (b) predicting the response for an unlabelled node compared to a vanilla graph convolutional network~(GCN) -- under mild growth conditions.

Nested Sampling is a robust alternative to standard MCMC, yet its typically sequential structure and hard constraints make efficient accelerator implementations difficult. This paper introduces Nested Slice Sampling (NSS), a GPU-friendly, vectorized formulation of Nested Sampling that uses Hit-and-Run Slice Sampling for constrained updates. A tuning analysis yields a simple near-optimal rule for setting the slice width, improving high-dimensional behavior and making per-step compute more predictable for parallel execution. Experiments on challenging synthetic targets, high dimensional Bayesian inference, and Gaussian process hyperparameter marginalization show that NSS maintains accurate evidence estimates and high-quality posterior samples, and is particularly robust on difficult multimodal problems where current state-of-the-art methods such as tempered SMC baselines can struggle.

Existing test-time adaptation methods are computationally intensive, rely on back-propagation, and often focus on single modalities. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Test-Time Adaptation with Brownian Distance Covariance (TaTa). TaTa leverages Brownian Distance Covariance-a powerful statistical measure that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies via pairwise distances-to dynamically adapt VLMs to new domains without training or back-propagation. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances stability by avoiding disruptive weight updates. TaTa further integrates attribute-enhanced prompting to improve vision-language inference with descriptive visual cues. Combined with dynamic clustering and pseudo-label refinement, it effectively recalibrates the model for novel visual contexts.

Learning-based denoising is promising, yet progress is hindered by scarce paired training data and the need for physically interpretable and reproducible models in scientific workflows. We propose a physics-based noise synthesis framework tailored to CCD noise formation. The pipeline models photon shot noise, photo-response non-uniformity, dark-current noise, readout effects, and localized outliers arising from cosmic-ray hits and hot pixels. To obtain low-noise inputs for synthesis, we average multiple unregistered exposures to produce high-SNR bases. Realistic noisy counterparts synthesized from these bases using our noise model enable the construction of abundant paired datasets for supervised learning.

This is a central challenge in human-robot interaction, where systems must be successful while being mindful of user agency. Previous approaches relied on static blending ratios or separated goal inference from assistance arbitration, leading to suboptimal performance in unstructured environments. We introduce BRACE (Bayesian Reinforcement Assistance with Context Encoding), a novel framework that fine-tunes Bayesian intent inference and context-adaptive assistance through an architecture enabling end-to-end gradient flow between intent inference and assistance arbitration. Our pipeline conditions collaborative control policies on environmental context and complete goal probability distributions. We provide analysis showing (1) optimal assistance levels should decrease with goal uncertainty and increase with environmental constraint severity, and (2) integrating belief information into policy learning yields a quadratic expected regret advantage over sequential approaches. We validated our algorithm against SOTA methods (IDA, DQN) using a three-part evaluation progressively isolating distinct challenges of end-effector control: (1) core human-interaction dynamics in a 2D human-in-the-loop cursor task, (2) non-linear dynamics of a robotic arm, and (3) integrated manipulation under goal ambiguity and environmental constraints. We demonstrate improvements over SOTA, achieving 6.3% higher success rates and 41% increased path efficiency, and 36.3% success rate and 87% path efficiency improvement over unassisted control. Our results confirmed that integrated optimization is most beneficial in complex, goal-ambiguous scenarios, and is generalizable across robotic domains requiring goal-directed assistance, advancing the SOTA for adaptive shared autonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "BRACE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u4ef2\u88c1\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5171\u4eab\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5171\u4eab\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u6bd4\u6216\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u4ef2\u88c1\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBRACE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u8fde\u63a5\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f85\u52a9\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u534f\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u73af\u5883\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u4ef2\u88c1\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cBRACE\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u53476.3%\uff0c\u8def\u5f84\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad841%\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u8f85\u52a9\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u534736.3%\uff0c\u8def\u5f84\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad887%\u3002\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u52bf\u6700\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6700\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u9700\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5171\u4eab\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6280\u672f\u524d\u6cbf\u3002"}}
