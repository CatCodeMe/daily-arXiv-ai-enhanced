### [1] [Computationally Intensive Research: Advancing a Role for Secondary Analysis of Qualitative Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04230)
*Kaveh Mohajeri,Amir Karami*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文探讨了利用计算方法重新分析过去定性研究数据的潜力，提出了计算密集型二次分析的方案及其对创新研究设计的促进作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定性研究数据通常未被充分利用，本文旨在挖掘其潜力，支持跨情境和纵向研究。

Method: 提出了一种计算密集型二次分析的方案，并讨论了其实现方法。

Result: 该方法能够整合多情境和时间段的数据，促进创新研究设计。

Conclusion: 尽管存在数据共享和重用的挑战，计算密集型二次分析为定性研究提供了新机会。

Abstract: This paper draws attention to the potential of computational methods in
reworking data generated in past qualitative studies. While qualitative
inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive
processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first
make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing
its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for
opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting
the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and
timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and
questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary
analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the
development of innovative research designs. Finally, we enumerate some key
challenges and ongoing concerns associated with qualitative data sharing and
reuse.

### [2] [OxO2 -- A SSSOM mapping browser for logically sound crosswalks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04286)
*Henriette Harmse,Haider Iqbal,Helen Parkinson,James McLaughlin*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: OxO2改进了OxO，通过SSSOM标准提供逻辑可靠的映射和详细的来源信息，使用Nemo引擎确保性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决OxO在逻辑可靠性、来源信息和系统稳定性方面的不足。

Method: 采用SSSOM标准定义映射来源和逻辑条件，并使用Nemo Datalog规则引擎实现高效推理。

Result: OxO2提供了更可靠的映射和稳定的性能，支持用户更自信地整合数据集。

Conclusion: OxO2通过SSSOM和Nemo的引入，显著提升了映射的逻辑性、来源透明性和系统稳定性。

Abstract: EMBL-EBI created OxO to enable users to map between datasets that are
annotated with different ontologies. Mappings identified by the first version
of OxO were not necessarily logically sound, missed important provenance
information such as author and reviewer, and could timeout or crash for certain
requests. In this paper we introduce OxO2 to address these concerns. Provenance
is addressed by implementing SSSOM, a mapping standard that defines provenance
for mappings. SSSOM defines the conditions under which logical sound mappings
can be derived and is implemented in OxO2 using, Nemo, a Datalog rule engine.
To ensure reasoning is performant and memory efficient, Nemo implements a
number of strategies that ensures OxO2 will be stable for all requests. Due to
these changes, OxO2 users will be able to integrate between disparate datasets
with greater confidence.

### [3] [BVLSM: Write-Efficient LSM-Tree Storage via WAL-Time Key-Value Separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04678)
*Ming Li,Wendi Cheng,Jiahe Wei,Xueqiang Shan,Liu Weikai,Xiaonan Zhao,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: BVLSM是一种在WAL阶段主动分离键值的机制，解决了LSM-Tree存储系统中的写放大、内存利用率低和I/O抖动问题，性能显著优于RocksDB和BlobDB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数据密集型应用处理大数据项时，LSM-Tree存储系统存在写放大、内存利用率低和I/O抖动等问题，需要改进。

Method: BVLSM在WAL阶段主动分离键值，MemTable仅存储轻量级元数据，支持多队列并行存储大数据。

Result: 在64KB随机写入负载下，BVLSM性能显著优于RocksDB和BlobDB，异步WAL模式下吞吐量提升7.6倍和1.9倍。

Conclusion: BVLSM通过早期键值分离有效解决了LSM-Tree存储系统的性能瓶颈，适用于大数据项场景。

Abstract: Modern data-intensive applications increasingly store and process big-value
items, such as multimedia objects and machine learning embeddings, which
exacerbate storage inefficiencies in Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM)-based
key-value stores. This paper presents BVLSM, a Write-Ahead Log (WAL)-time
key-value separation mechanism designed to address three key challenges in
LSM-Tree storage systems: write amplification, poor memory utilization, and I/O
jitter under big-value workloads. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches that delay
key-value separation until the flush stage, leading to redundant data in
MemTables and repeated writes. BVLSM proactively decouples keys and values
during the WAL phase. The MemTable stores only lightweight metadata, allowing
multi-queue parallel store for big value. The benchmark results show that BVLSM
significantly outperforms both RocksDB and BlobDB under 64KB random write
workloads. In asynchronous WAL mode, it achieves throughput improvements of
7.6x over RocksDB and 1.9x over BlobDB.

### [4] [Memory Hierarchy Design for Caching Middleware in the Age of NVM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05071)
*Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Sandy Irani,Jenny Lam*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在固定预算下如何配置多级缓存存储层次结构，以优化性能和恢复时间，通过建模为多选择背包问题（MCKP）并提出高效近似算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着非易失性内存（NVM）等存储技术的发展，系统设计者面临如何在多级缓存层次结构中配置存储介质、容量及数据复制的挑战。

Method: 将缓存配置问题建模为多选择背包问题（MCKP），利用线性规划松弛高效求解近似最优解。

Result: 结果表明，在特定故障率和负载特征下选择性复制更优；而在低故障率和高数据更新频率下，分层存储优于复制。

Conclusion: 通过MCKP模型和算法，能够有效指导多级缓存配置，平衡性能与成本。

Abstract: Advances in storage technology have introduced Non-Volatile Memory, NVM, as a
new storage medium. NVM, along with Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Solid
State Disk (SSD), and Disk present a system designer with a wide array of
options in designing caching middleware. Moreover, design decisions to
replicate a data item in more than one level of a caching memory hierarchy may
enhance the overall system performance with a faster recovery time in the event
of a memory failure. Given a fixed budget, the key configuration questions are:
Which storage media should constitute the memory hierarchy? What is the storage
capacity of each hierarchy? Should data be replicated or partitioned across the
different levels of the hierarchy? We model these cache configuration questions
as an instance of the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP). This model is
guided by the specification of each type of memory along with an application's
database characteristics and its workload. Although MCKP is NP-complete, its
linear programming relaxation is efficiently solvable and can be used to
closely approximate the optimal solution. We use the resulting simple algorithm
to evaluate design tradeoffs in the context of a memory hierarchy for a
Key-Value Store (e.g., memcached) as well as a host-side cache (e.g.,
Flashcache). The results show selective replication is appropriate with certain
failure rates and workload characteristics. With a slim failure rate and
frequent data updates, tiering of data across the different storage media that
constitute the cache is superior to replication.

### [5] [Fully-Distributed Construction of Byzantine-Resilient Dynamic Peer-to-Peer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04368)
*Aayush Gupta,Gopal Pandurangan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We address a fundamental problem in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, namely,
constructing and maintaining dynamic P2P overlay network topologies with
essential properties such as connectivity, low diameter, and high expansion,
that are resilient to continuous high churn and the presence of a large number
of malicious (Byzantine) nodes. Our main goal is to construct and maintain a
sparse (bounded degree) expander topology despite high churn and a large number
of Byzantine nodes. Such an expander topology has logarithmic diameter, high
expansion, and is robust to churn and the presence of a large number of bad
nodes, and facilitates efficient and robust algorithms for fundamental problems
in distributed computing, such as agreement, broadcasting, routing, etc.
  Our main contribution is a randomized, fully-distributed dynamic P2P protocol
that works with only local initial knowledge and guarantees, with a high
probability, the maintenance of a constant degree graph with high expansion
even under continuous churn and in the presence of a large number of Byzantine
nodes. Our protocol can tolerate up to $o(n/poly\log(n))$ Byzantine nodes
(where $n$ is the stable network size). Our protocol is efficient, lightweight,
and scalable, and it incurs only $O(poly\log(n))$ overhead for topology
maintenance: only polylogarithmic (in $n$) bits need to be processed and sent
by each honest node per round, and any honest node's computation cost per round
is also polylogarithmic.
  Our protocol can be used as a building block for solving fundamental
distributed computing problems in highly dynamic networks, such as Byzantine
agreement and Byzantine leader election, and enables fast and scalable
algorithms for these problems.

### [6] [Knowledge-Guided Attention-Inspired Learning for Task Offloading in Vehicle Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04456)
*Ke Ma,Junfei Xie*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的任务卸载方法KATO，通过注意力机制和迭代算法优化任务分配，显著降低计算开销并实现接近最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车辆边缘计算（VEC）需要高效的任务卸载策略，现有方法计算成本高或效果不佳。

Method: KATO结合注意力启发的编码器-解码器模型选择RSU子集，并通过迭代算法计算最优任务分配。

Result: 仿真表明KATO在降低计算开销的同时实现接近最优性能，且适用于不同规模和配置的网络。

Conclusion: KATO为VEC提供了一种高效且通用的任务卸载解决方案。

Abstract: Vehicle edge computing (VEC) brings abundant computing resources close to
vehicles by deploying them at roadside units (RSUs) or base stations, thereby
enabling diverse computation-intensive and delay sensitive applications.
Existing task offloading strategies are often computationally expensive to
execute or generate suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel
learning-based approach, Knowledge-guided Attention-inspired Task Offloading
(KATO), designed to efficiently offload tasks from moving vehicles to nearby
RSUs. KATO integrates an attention-inspired encoder-decoder model for selecting
a subset of RSUs that can reduce overall task processing time, along with an
efficient iterative algorithm for computing optimal task allocation among the
selected RSUs. Simulation results demonstrate that KATO achieves optimal or
near-optimal performance with significantly lower computational overhead and
generalizes well across networks of varying sizes and configurations.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SkimROOT是一种利用数据处理器（DPU）加速高能物理（HEP）数据分析的近数据过滤系统，通过在存储服务器上直接过滤数据，减少数据传输和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型强子对撞机（LHC）数据分析的瓶颈在于存储节点与计算节点之间的数据传输速度慢。

Method: 引入SkimROOT系统，利用DPU在存储服务器上直接过滤数据，仅返回相关数据。

Result: 原型系统实现了44.3倍的性能提升。

Conclusion: SkimROOT为更快的物理发现铺平了道路。

Abstract: Data analysis in high-energy physics (HEP) begins with data reduction, where
vast datasets are filtered to extract relevant events. At the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC), this process is bottlenecked by slow data transfers between
storage and compute nodes. To address this, we introduce SkimROOT, a near-data
filtering system leveraging Data Processing Units (DPUs) to accelerate LHC data
analysis. By performing filtering directly on storage servers and returning
only the relevant data, SkimROOT minimizes data movement and reduces processing
delays. Our prototype demonstrates significant efficiency gains, achieving a
44.3$\times$ performance improvement, paving the way for faster physics
discoveries.

*Osayamen Jonathan Aimuyo,Byungsoo Oh,Rachee Singh*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlashDMoE是一种完全基于GPU的MoE算子，通过融合计算和通信到单一持久GPU内核，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型实现存在GPU利用率低、延迟高和无法利用任务局部性的问题。

Method: 开发FlashDMoE，融合专家计算和GPU间通信到单一持久内核，实现细粒度流水线。

Result: 在8-H100 GPU节点上，FlashDMoE实现了6倍延迟降低、5.7倍吞吐提升、4倍弱扩展效率提升和9倍GPU利用率提升。

Conclusion: FlashDMoE证明了GPU内核与硬件协同设计对提升大规模分布式ML性能的关键作用。

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables
sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, offering a scalable
path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations
suffer from \emph{low GPU utilization}, \emph{significant latency overhead},
and a fundamental \emph{inability to leverage task locality}, primarily due to
CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel
launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashDMoE, a fully
GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU
communication into a \emph{single persistent GPU kernel}. FlashDMoE enables
fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating
launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Its device-initiated communication
protocol introduces \emph{payload-efficient} data transfers, significantly
shrinking buffer sizes in sparsely activated MoE layers. When evaluated on a
single 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models having up to 128 experts and 16K token
sequences, FlashDMoE achieves up to \textbf{6}x lower latency, \textbf{5,7}x
higher throughput, \textbf{4}x better weak scaling efficiency, and \textbf{9}x
higher GPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art baselines, despite using
FP32 while baselines use FP16. FlashDMoE demonstrates that principled GPU
kernel-hardware co-design is key to unlocking the performance ceiling of
large-scale distributed ML workloads.

Abstract: Backscatter system is a system based on backscatter communication technology,
which is a low cost, low power consumption and easy to deploy communication

### [11] [Energy-Optimized Scheduling for AIoT Workloads Using TOPSIS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04902)
*Preethika Pradeep,Eyhab Al-Masri*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: GreenPod是一个基于TOPSIS的调度器，优化Kubernetes中的Pod放置，提升AIoT工作负载的能源效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kubernetes默认调度器缺乏对异构环境的多标准优化，无法满足AIoT工作负载的能源效率需求。

Method: GreenPod采用TOPSIS方法，综合考虑执行时间、能耗、处理核心、内存可用性和资源平衡等因素。

Result: 在异构Google Kubernetes集群中测试，GreenPod比默认调度器提升能源效率高达39.1%。

Conclusion: GreenPod在AIoT应用中有效平衡了可持续性和性能。

Abstract: AIoT workloads demand energy-efficient orchestration across cloud-edge
infrastructures, but Kubernetes' default scheduler lacks multi-criteria
optimization for heterogeneous environments. This paper presents GreenPod, a
TOPSIS-based scheduler optimizing pod placement based on execution time, energy
consumption, processing core, memory availability, and resource balance. Tested
on a heterogeneous Google Kubernetes cluster, GreenPod improves energy
efficiency by up to 39.1% over the default Kubernetes (K8s) scheduler,
particularly with energy-centric weighting schemes. Medium complexity workloads
showed the highest energy savings, despite slight scheduling latency. GreenPod
effectively balances sustainability and performance for AIoT applications.

### [12] [Improved Byzantine Agreement under an Adaptive Adversary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04919)
*Fabien Dufoulon,Gopal Pandurangan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对自适应拜占庭对手的随机化拜占庭协议，改进了现有的轮数复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自适应拜占庭对手（能够根据协议执行动态选择拜占庭节点）的拜占庭协议，填补现有静态对手研究的不足。

Method: 提出了一种同步随机化拜占庭协议，适用于自适应对手模型，对手具有全局网络状态信息和无限计算能力。

Result: 协议在$O(\min\{t^2\log n/n, t/\log n\})$轮内达成一致，优于之前$O(t/\log n)$的轮数复杂度。

Conclusion: 该协议在自适应拜占庭对手模型下显著提升了效率，为分布式计算领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Byzantine agreement is a fundamental problem in fault-tolerant distributed
computing that has been studied intensively for the last four decades. Much of
the research has focused on a static Byzantine adversary, where the adversary
is constrained to choose the Byzantine nodes in advance of the protocol's
execution. This work focuses on the harder case of an adaptive Byzantine
adversary that can choose the Byzantine nodes \emph{adaptively} based on the
protocol's execution. While efficient $O(\log n)$-round protocols ($n$ is the
total number of nodes) are known for the static adversary (Goldwasser, Pavlov,
and Vaikuntanathan, FOCS 2006) tolerating up to $t < n/(3+\epsilon)$ Byzantine
nodes, $\Omega(t/\sqrt{n \log n})$ rounds is a well-known lower bound for
adaptive adversary [Bar-Joseph and Ben-Or, PODC 1998]. The best-known protocol
for adaptive adversary runs in $O(t/\log n)$ rounds [Chor and Coan, IEEE Trans.
Soft. Engg., 1985].
  This work presents a synchronous randomized Byzantine agreement protocol
under an adaptive adversary that improves over previous results. Our protocol
works under the powerful \emph{adaptive rushing adversary in the full
information model}. That is, we assume that the Byzantine nodes can behave
arbitrarily and maliciously, have knowledge about the entire state of the
network at every round, including random choices made by all the nodes up to
and including the current round, have unlimited computational power, and may
collude among themselves. Furthermore, the adversary can \emph{adaptively}
corrupt up to $t < n/3$ nodes based on the protocol's execution. We present a
simple randomized Byzantine agreement protocol that runs in $O(\min\{t^2\log
n/n, t/\log n\})$ rounds that improves over the long-standing bound of
$O(t/\log n)$ rounds due to Chor and Coan [IEEE Trans. Soft. Engg., 1985].

*Vicenzo Bonasorte*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 研究了动态随机图中谣言传播的完成时间，提出了一种基于强平稳时间的方法，适用于马尔可夫和非马尔可夫动态图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨动态随机图中信息传播的完成时间，扩展强平稳时间的概念以适用于更广泛的动态图模型。

Method: 基于强平稳时间的方法，结合马尔可夫动态图的已有结果，并通过耦合从过去算法扩展到非马尔可夫动态。

Result: 扩展了强平稳时间的概念，使其适用于非马尔可夫动态图，并提供了完成时间的分析方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效分析动态随机图中信息传播的完成时间，适用于马尔可夫和非马尔可夫动态图。

Abstract: We study rumor spreading in dynamic random graphs. Starting with a single
informed vertex, the information flows until it reaches all the vertices of the
graph (completion), according to the following process. At each step $k$, the
information is propagated to neighbors of the informed vertices, in the $k$-th
generated random graph. The way this information propagates from vertex to
vertex at each step will depend on the ``protocol". We provide a method based
on strong stationary times to study the completion time when the graphs are
Markovian time dependent, using known results of the literature for independent
graphs. The concept of strong stationary times is then extended to
non-Markovian Dynamics using coupling from the past algorithms. This allows to
extend results on completion times for non-Markov dynamics

*Jakub Łącki,Slobodan Mitrović,Srikkanth Ramachandran,Wen-Horng Sheu*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文研究了MPC模型中的分配问题，提出了一种$(1+\epsilon)$近似算法，运行时间为$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log \lambda})$轮，使用亚线性空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分配问题是$b$-匹配的特例，此前在低树宽图中，LOCAL或亚线性空间MPC模型中均无$o(\log n)$轮的常数近似算法。

Method: 通过改进Agrawal等人的LOCAL算法，将其轮复杂度从$O(\log n)$降至$O(\log \lambda)$。

Result: 算法在$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log \lambda})$轮内完成，总空间为$\tilde{O}(\lambda n)$。

Conclusion: 本文填补了低树宽图中高效分配算法的空白，为MPC模型提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the allocation problem in the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC)
model. This problem is a special case of $b$-matching, in which the input is a
bipartite graph with capacities greater than $1$ in only one part of the
bipartition. We give a $(1+\epsilon)$ approximate algorithm for the problem,
which runs in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log \lambda})$ MPC rounds, using sublinear
space per machine and $\tilde{O}(\lambda n)$ total space, where $\lambda$ is
the arboricity of the input graph. Our result is obtained by providing a new
analysis of a LOCAL algorithm by Agrawal, Zadimoghaddam, and Mirrokni [ICML
2018], which improves its round complexity from $O(\log n)$ to $O(\log
\lambda)$. Prior to our work, no $o(\log n)$ round algorithm for
constant-approximate allocation was known in either LOCAL or sublinear space
MPC models for graphs with low arboricity.

Conclusion: 论文为异构图上的在线二分图匹配提供了理论支持，并分析了探索-利用权衡的影响。

Abstract: While online bipartite matching has gained significant attention in recent
years, existing analyses in stochastic settings fail to capture the performance
of algorithms on heterogeneous graphs, such as those incorporating inter-group
affinities or other social network structures. In this work, we address this
gap by studying online bipartite matching within the stochastic block model
(SBM). A fixed set of offline nodes is matched to a stream of online arrivals,
with connections governed probabilistically by latent class memberships. We
analyze two natural algorithms: a $\tt{Myopic}$ policy that greedily matches
each arrival to the most compatible class, and the $\tt{Balance}$ algorithm,
which accounts for both compatibility and remaining capacity. For the
$\tt{Myopic}$ algorithm, we prove that the size of the matching converges, with
high probability, to the solution of an ordinary differential equation (ODE),
for which we provide a tractable approximation along with explicit error
bounds. For the $\tt{Balance}$ algorithm, we demonstrate convergence of the

TL;DR: 本文探讨了扩展Burrows-Wheeler变换（eBWT）中不同单词分解对运行数的影响，揭示了分解选择对压缩效率的潜在成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究eBWT在多重字符串集合中的应用，分析不同分解方式对运行数的影响，以优化压缩性能。

Method: 通过理论分析，展示单词分解的指数级数量，并构建无限单词家族，比较最优和最差分解的运行数比例。

Result: 发现分解数量呈指数增长，且存在无限单词家族的最优与最差分解运行数比例无界。

Conclusion: 分解选择对eBWT压缩效率有显著影响，优化运行长度编码在广义BWT框架中具有挑战性。

Abstract: The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is a fundamental component in many data
structures for text indexing and compression, widely used in areas such as
bioinformatics and information retrieval. The extended BWT (eBWT) generalizes
the classical BWT to multisets of strings, providing a flexible framework that
captures many BWT-like constructions. Several known variants of the BWT can be
viewed as instances of the eBWT applied to specific decompositions of a word. A
central property of the BWT, essential for its compressibility, is the number
of maximal ranges of equal letters, named runs. In this article, we explore how
different decompositions of a word impact the number of runs in the resulting
eBWT. First, we show that the number of decompositions of a word is
exponential, even under minimal constraints on the size of the subsets in the
decomposition. Second, we present an infinite family of words for which the
ratio of the number of runs between the worst and best decompositions is
unbounded, under the same minimal constraints. These results illustrate the
potential cost of decomposition choices in eBWT-based compression and underline
the challenges in optimizing run-length encoding in generalized BWT frameworks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种弹性模式挖掘（RPM）问题，旨在找到在字符串中即使任意k个位置被替换后仍出现至少τ次的子串，并提出了高效的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统频繁模式挖掘未考虑字符串可能被修改的情况，而实际应用中（如基因组数据）这种修改是常见且昂贵的。

Method: 提出了一种基于高级数据结构和组合洞察的O(n log n)时间、O(n)空间的精确算法。

Result: 实验表明弹性子串在基因组数据分析中更有效，算法比动态规划基线快且节省空间，基于弹性子串的聚类效果良好。

Conclusion: 弹性模式挖掘在实际应用中具有价值，尤其在需要鲁棒性的场景中。

Abstract: Frequent pattern mining is a flagship problem in data mining. In its most
basic form, it asks for the set of substrings of a given string $S$ of length
$n$ that occur at least $\tau$ times in $S$, for some integer $\tau\in[1,n]$.
We introduce a resilient version of this classic problem, which we term the
$(\tau, k)$-Resilient Pattern Mining (RPM) problem. Given a string $S$ of
length $n$ and two integers $\tau, k\in[1,n]$, RPM asks for the set of
substrings of $S$ that occur at least $\tau$ times in $S$, even when the
letters at any $k$ positions of $S$ are substituted by other letters. Unlike
frequent substrings, resilient ones account for the fact that changes to string
$S$ are often expensive to handle or are unknown.
  We propose an exact $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$-time and $\mathcal{O}(n)$-space
algorithm for RPM, which employs advanced data structures and combinatorial
insights. We then present experiments on real large-scale datasets from
different domains demonstrating that: (I) The notion of resilient substrings is
useful in analyzing genomic data and is more powerful than that of frequent
substrings, in scenarios where resilience is required, such as in the case of
versioned datasets; (II) Our algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster
and more space-efficient than a baseline algorithm that is based on dynamic
programming; and (III) Clustering based on resilient substrings is effective.

Motivation: 超图（如合著关系、社交群组成员等）规模庞大，存储、传输和查询性能面临挑战。

Method: 提出HyperCSA压缩方法，支持标准查询。

Result: 在真实超图上压缩比为26%至79%，查询速度提升6至40倍，且能处理更大数据集。

Conclusion: HyperCSA在压缩率和查询性能上优于现有方法，适用于大规模超图。

Abstract: Hypergraphs model complex, non-binary relationships like co-authorships,
social group memberships, and recommendations. Like traditional graphs,
hypergraphs can grow large, posing challenges for storage, transmission, and
query performance. We propose HyperCSA, a novel compression method for
hypergraphs that maintains support for standard queries over the succinct
representation. HyperCSA achieves compression ratios of 26% to 79% of the
original file size on real-world hypergraphs - outperforming existing methods
on all large hypergraphs in our experiments. Additionally, HyperCSA scales to
larger datasets than existing approaches. Furthermore, for common real-world
hypergraphs, HyperCSA evaluates neighbor queries 6 to 40 times faster than both
standard data structures and other hypergraph compression approaches.

### [19] [On Minimizers of Minimum Density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05277)
*Arseny Shur*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效算法，用于在给定参数下找到最小密度的minimizer，并通过正则语言和有限自动机分析优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimizer在计算生物学中有广泛应用，但现有方法搜索空间巨大且计算复杂度高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种时间复杂度为$w\cdot 2^{\sigma^k+O(k)}$的算法，并利用正则语言和有限自动机分析优化minimizer。

Result: 实现了算法，计算了多种参数组合下的最小密度minimizer，并与理论下界进行了比较。

Conclusion: 新算法显著提高了计算效率，并通过正则语言方法为minimizer研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Minimizers are sampling schemes with numerous applications in computational
biology. Assuming a fixed alphabet of size $\sigma$, a minimizer is defined by
two integers $k,w\ge2$ and a linear order $\rho$ on strings of length $k$ (also
called $k$-mers). A string is processed by a sliding window algorithm that
chooses, in each window of length $w+k-1$, its minimal $k$-mer with respect to
$\rho$. A key characteristic of the minimizer is its density, which is the
expected frequency of chosen $k$-mers among all $k$-mers in a random infinite
$\sigma$-ary string. Minimizers of smaller density are preferred as they
produce smaller samples with the same guarantee: each window is represented by
a $k$-mer.
  The problem of finding a minimizer of minimum density for given input
parameters $(\sigma,k,w)$ has a huge search space of $(\sigma^k)!$ and is
representable by an ILP of size $\tilde\Theta(\sigma^{k+w})$, which has
worst-case solution time that is doubly-exponential in $(k+w)$ under standard
complexity assumptions. We solve this problem in $w\cdot 2^{\sigma^k+O(k)}$
time and provide several additional tricks reducing the practical runtime and
search space. As a by-product, we describe an algorithm computing the average
density of a minimizer within the same time bound. Then we propose a novel
method of studying minimizers via regular languages and show how to find, via
the eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis over finite automata, minimizers with the
minimal density in the asymptotic case $w\to\infty$. Implementing our
algorithms, we compute the minimum density minimizers for
$(\sigma,k)\in\{(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(4,2)\}$ and \textbf{all} $w\ge 2$. The
obtained densities are compared against the average density and the theoretical
lower bounds, including the new bound presented in this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多块代码修复在实际中常见，但现有自动修复技术主要针对单块场景，缺乏对多块复杂性的研究。

Method: 提出了hunk divergence指标和spatial proximity分类，基于HUNK4J数据集进行实证研究。

Result: 研究发现LLM的成功率随编辑差异和空间分散增加而下降，尤其在高度分散的Fragment类中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在多块修复中的能力缺陷，呼吁开发基于差异感知的修复策略。

Abstract: Multi-hunk bugs, where fixes span disjoint regions of code, are common in
practice, yet remain underrepresented in automated repair. Existing techniques
and benchmarks pre-dominantly target single-hunk scenarios, overlooking the
added complexity of coordinating semantically related changes across the
codebase. In this work, we characterize HUNK4J, a dataset of multi-hunk patches
derived from 372 real-world defects. We propose hunk divergence, a metric that
quantifies the variation among edits in a patch by capturing lexical,
structural, and file-level differences, while incorporating the number of hunks
involved. We further define spatial proximity, a classification that models how
hunks are spatially distributed across the program hierarchy. Our empirical
study spanning six LLMs reveals that model success rates decline with increased
divergence and spatial dispersion. Notably, when using the LLM alone, no model
succeeds in the most dispersed Fragment class. These findings highlight a
critical gap in LLM capabilities and motivate divergence-aware repair
strategies.

Abstract: Autonomous systems have gained an important role in many industry domains and
are beginning to change everyday life. However, due to dynamically emerging
applications and often proprietary constraints, there is a lack of information
about the practice of developing autonomous systems. This paper presents the
first part of the longitudinal study focused on establishing
state-of-the-practice, identifying and quantifying the challenges and benefits,
identifying the processes and standards used, and exploring verification and
validation (V&V) practices used for the development of autonomous systems. The
results presented in this paper are based on data about software systems that
have autonomous functionality and may employ model-based software engineering
(MBSwE) and reuse. These data were collected using an anonymous online survey
that was administered in 2019 and were provided by experts with experience in
development of autonomous systems and /or the use of MBSwE. Our current work is
focused on repeating the survey to collect more recent data and discover how
the development of autonomous systems has evolved over time.

Result: 定量和定性比较显示，CoRAL生成的评论优于现有基线技术。

Conclusion: CoRAL在自动化代码审查评论生成方面表现出高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Code review is a crucial component of modern software development, involving
the evaluation of code quality, providing feedback on potential issues, and
refining the code to address identified problems. Despite these benefits, code
review can be rather time consuming, and influenced by subjectivity and human
factors. For these reasons, techniques to (partially) automate the code review
process have been proposed in the literature. Among those, the ones exploiting
deep learning (DL) are able to tackle the generative aspect of code review, by
commenting on a given code as a human reviewer would do (i.e., comment
generation task) or by automatically implementing code changes required to
address a reviewer's comment (i.e., code refinement task). In this paper, we
introduce CoRAL, a deep learning framework automating review comment generation
by exploiting reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both
the semantics of the generated comments as well as their usefulness as input
for other models automating the code refinement task. The core idea is that if
the DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected
ones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code
refinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus
deserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework. We present
both quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the comments generated by
CoRAL and those produced by the latest baseline techniques, highlighting the
effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

Result: 优化速度提升10,000倍，效果与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: BINGO效应解释了简单方法在SE中的成功，挑战了传统CPU密集型优化的必要性。

Abstract: Traditional multi-objective optimization in software engineering (SE) can be
slow and complex. This paper introduces the BINGO effect: a novel phenomenon
where SE data surprisingly collapses into a tiny fraction of possible solution
"buckets" (e.g., only 100 used from 4,096 expected).
  We show the BINGO effect's prevalence across 39 optimization in SE problems.
Exploiting this, we optimize 10,000 times faster than state-of-the-art methods,
with comparable effectiveness. Our new algorithms (LITE and LINE), demonstrate
that simple stochastic selection can match complex optimizers like DEHB. This
work explains why simple methods succeed in SE-real data occupies a small
corner of possibilities-and guides when to apply them, challenging the need for
CPU-heavy optimization.
  Our data and code are public at GitHub (see anon-artifacts/bingo).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在复杂云环境中效果不佳，而深度学习方法存在计算成本高和可解释性差的问题，因此需要一种更高效且可解释的解决方案。

Method: KPIRoot+结合相似性和因果分析，使用符号聚合近似（SAX）表示KPI，并通过改进解决了KPIRoot的局限性。

Result: KPIRoot+在性能上优于8种先进基线方法，提升幅度为2.9%至35.7%，同时时间成本降低34.7%。

Conclusion: KPIRoot+在实际云环境中表现优异，为性能监控和根因定位提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of cloud systems, their performance is monitored
using KPIs (key performance indicators). When issues arise, root cause
localization identifies KPIs responsible for service degradation, aiding in
quick diagnosis and resolution. Traditional methods rely on similarity
calculations, which can be ineffective in complex, interdependent cloud
environments. While deep learning-based approaches model these dependencies
better, they often face challenges such as high computational demands and lack
of interpretability.
  To address these issues, KPIRoot is proposed as an efficient method combining
similarity and causality analysis. It uses symbolic aggregate approximation for
compact KPI representation, improving analysis efficiency. However, deployment
in Cloud H revealed two drawbacks: 1) threshold-based anomaly detection misses
some performance anomalies, and 2) SAX representation fails to capture
intricate variation trends. KPIRoot+ addresses these limitations, outperforming
eight state-of-the-art baselines by 2.9% to 35.7%, while reducing time cost by
34.7%. We also share our experience deploying KPIRoot in a large-scale cloud
provider's production environment.

Motivation: 探索AI编程助手（如GitHub Copilot）在结对编程中知识转移的效果，并与传统人类结对编程进行比较。

Method: 通过实证研究，一组开发者进行人类结对编程，另一组使用GitHub Copilot完成任务，并扩展知识转移框架进行评估。

Result: 人类-AI和人类-人类结对编程在知识转移频率和主题上相似，但开发者对AI建议的接受度更高，AI还能提醒开发者注意代码细节。

Conclusion: AI编程助手在知识转移方面与传统人类结对编程效果相当，但开发者需更审慎对待AI建议，同时AI能补充人类开发者的遗漏。

Abstract: Knowledge transfer is fundamental to human collaboration and is therefore
common in software engineering. Pair programming is a prominent instance. With
the rise of AI coding assistants, developers now not only work with human
partners but also, as some claim, with AI pair programmers. Although studies
confirm knowledge transfer during human pair programming, its effectiveness
with AI coding assistants remains uncertain. To analyze knowledge transfer in
both human-human and human-AI settings, we conducted an empirical study where
developer pairs solved a programming task without AI support, while a separate
group of individual developers completed the same task using the AI coding
assistant GitHub Copilot. We extended an existing knowledge transfer framework
and employed a semi-automated evaluation pipeline to assess differences in
knowledge transfer episodes across both settings. We found a similar frequency
of successful knowledge transfer episodes and overlapping topical categories
across both settings. Two of our key findings are that developers tend to
accept GitHub Copilot's suggestions with less scrutiny than those from human
pair programming partners, but also that GitHub Copilot can subtly remind
developers of important code details they might otherwise overlook.

Motivation: 软件漏洞对安全构成重大威胁，但漏洞修补作为自动程序修复（APR）的关键部分尚未充分研究。

Method: 研究使用CodeBERT和CodeT5模型，在六个数据集和四种语言中评估其漏洞修补能力，包括准确性和泛化性。

Result: CodeBERT在稀疏上下文表现更好，CodeT5在复杂模式上更优且扩展性更强，但模型对未知数据的泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 研究为自动漏洞修补提供了基准和实用见解，但需进一步解决泛化问题以适用于实际安全应用。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, requiring
effective mitigation. While Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced in
fixing general bugs, vulnerability patching, a security-critical aspect of APR
remains underexplored. This study investigates pre-trained language models,
CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets
and four languages. We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown
vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with
fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such
scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns.
CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned
models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen)
datasets. While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models
struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust
vulnerability detection. This study benchmarks model performance, identifies
limitations in generalization, and provides actionable insights to advance
automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

TL;DR: Tech-ASan是一种基于两阶段检查的技术，通过减少昂贵的影子内存访问和消除冗余检查，显著降低了Address Sanitizer（ASan）的运行开销，同时保持检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASan在检测内存安全违规方面非常有效，但其高运行时开销限制了其在大型软件测试中的效率。现有方法未能充分消除冗余检查或牺牲了检测能力。

Method: 1. 提出两阶段检查算法，利用魔法值比较减少影子内存访问；2. 设计高效优化器消除冗余检查，包括循环中的检查；3. 基于LLVM实现Tech-ASan。

Result: 在SPEC CPU2006基准测试中，Tech-ASan比ASan和ASan--分别减少33.70%和17.89%的运行开销，且在Juliet测试套件中检测到更少的假阴性案例。

Conclusion: Tech-ASan在降低运行开销的同时保持了检测能力，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Address Sanitizer (ASan) is a sharp weapon for detecting memory safety
violations, including temporal and spatial errors hidden in C/C++ programs
during execution. However, ASan incurs significant runtime overhead, which
limits its efficiency in testing large software. The overhead mainly comes from
sanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access. Over
the past decade, many methods have been developed to speed up ASan by
eliminating and accelerating sanitizer checks, however, they either fail to
adequately eliminate redundant checks or compromise detection capabilities. To
address this issue, this paper presents Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based
technique to accelerate ASan with safety assurance. First, we propose a novel
two-stage check algorithm for ASan, which leverages magic value comparison to
reduce most of the costly shadow memory accesses. Second, we design an
efficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks, which integrates a novel
algorithm for removing checks in loops. Third, we implement Tech-ASan as a
memory safety tool based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Our evaluation
using the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark shows that Tech-ASan outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods with 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan
and ASan--, respectively. Moreover, Tech-ASan detects 56 fewer false negative
cases than ASan and ASan-- when testing on the Juliet Test Suite under the same
redzone setting.

Motivation: 现有自动化GUI测试方法未能充分结合应用业务逻辑，导致关键功能测试缺失。

Method: 利用LLM理解GUI语义，通过五个智能体（Observer、Decider、Executor、Supervisor、Recorder）协作生成测试。

Result: 实验证明ScenGen能有效生成基于场景的GUI测试。

Conclusion: ScenGen通过LLM和多智能体协作填补了自动化测试与业务逻辑间的鸿沟。

Abstract: The assurance of mobile app GUI is more and more significant. Automated GUI
testing approaches of different strategies have been developed, while there are
still huge gaps between the approaches and the app business logic, not taking
the completion of specific testing scenarios as the exploration target, leading
to the exploration missing of critical app functionalities. Learning from the
manual testing, which takes testing scenarios with app business logic as the
basic granularity, in this paper, we utilize the LLMs to understand the
semantics presented in app GUI and how they are mapped in the testing context
based on specific testing scenarios. Then, scenario-based GUI tests are
generated with the guidance of multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, we
propose ScenGen, a novel LLM-guided scenario-based GUI testing approach
involving five agents to respectively take responsibilities of different phases
of the manual testing process. The Observer perceives the app GUI state by
extracting GUI widgets and forming GUI layouts, understanding the expressed
semantics. Then the app GUI info is sent to the Decider to make decisions on
target widgets based on the target testing scenarios. The decision-making
process takes the completion of specific testing scenarios as the exploration
target. The Executor then executes the demanding operations on the apps. The
execution results are checked by the Supervisor on whether the generated tests
are consistent with the completion target of the testing scenarios, ensuring
the traceability of the test generation and execution. Furthermore, the
corresponding GUI test operations are recorded to the context memory by
Recorder as an important basis for further decision-making, meanwhile
monitoring the runtime bug occurrences. ScenGen is evaluated and the results
show that ScenGen can effectively generate scenario-based GUI tests guided by
LLMs.

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising
avenues of future research in this domain.

*Konstantin Kirchheim,Frank Ortmeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用马尔可夫逻辑网络（MLN）增强现有OOD检测器的方法，通过概率推理提高性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界场景中，确保深度学习模型的可靠性需要有效的OOD检测。当前方法主要依赖统计模型，缺乏可解释性。

Method: 结合马尔可夫逻辑网络（MLN），通过加权逻辑约束对输入进行概率分配，增强现有OOD检测器。

Result: 实验表明，MLN能显著提升多种OOD检测器的性能，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: MLN为OOD检测提供了可解释且高效的增强方法，并展示了学习逻辑约束的有效性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a
dataset and showcase its effectiveness.

### [33] [Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for Time-Dependent Concrete Creep Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04243)
*Warayut Dokduea,Weerachart Tangchirapat,Sompote Youwai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的三重注意力Transformer架构，用于预测时间依赖性混凝土徐变，解决了现有方法仅将时间作为输入参数而未建模变形发展序列性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在预测混凝土徐变时未充分建模时间序列性，限制了预测精度。本文旨在通过Transformer的自注意力机制捕捉历史徐变模式的长程依赖关系。

Method: 采用三重注意力框架，包括时间注意力、特征注意力和批次注意力，将混凝土徐变预测转化为自回归序列建模任务。

Result: 在160天的标准化数据集上，模型表现优异，平均绝对百分比误差为1.63%，R2值为0.999，显著优于传统方法和现有机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了Transformer架构在材料科学问题中的可行性，为结构行为预测和工程设计实践提供了数据驱动的新思路。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

Conclusion: SafeSteer展示了简单技术在激活导向中的优势，为LLM的安全调整提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving safety policies
is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often
outperform more complex ones in activation steering. We showcase the
effectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk
categories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent
blanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while
maintaining topic relevance.

Result: 该方法提供了更具体和区域化的火灾风险预测，适用于实际操作。

Conclusion: 论文强调了地方化风险评估的重要性，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在边缘设备上部署时面临内存和运行时复杂性的挑战，现有增量验证方法仅关注量化且难以处理结构变化。

Method: 将原始和压缩网络编码为SMT公式，分类变化，利用原始网络的MUCs指导压缩网络的验证。

Result: 实验证明MUC-G4能有效处理量化和剪枝，验证时间显著缩短，证明重用率高。

Conclusion: MUC-G4为压缩神经网络的安全性和可靠性提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural
networks in practical applications.

Abstract: We study the role of the sampling distribution in Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and aim to understand its impact on DPO's training dynamics.
Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first
analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient
descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify
the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more
effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework
in practice.

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

Conclusion: 结论表明该模型能有效权衡成本与速度，为实际部署提供指导。

Abstract: We develop a theoretical model that addresses the economic trade-off between
cost per token versus serial token generation speed when deploying LLMs for
inference at scale. Our model takes into account arithmetic, memory bandwidth,
network bandwidth and latency constraints; and optimizes over different
parallelism setups and batch sizes to find the ones that optimize serial
inference speed at a given cost per token. We use the model to compute Pareto
frontiers of serial speed versus cost per token for popular language models.

### [40] [DrSR: LLM based Scientific Equation Discovery with Dual Reasoning from Data and Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04282)

TL;DR: DrSR（双推理符号回归）通过结合数据驱动洞察与反思学习，提升符号回归的鲁棒性和发现能力，优于传统和基于LLM的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的符号回归方法（如LLM-SR）过度依赖内部先验，缺乏对数据的显式理解和系统反思，限制了其性能。

Method: DrSR通过引导LLM分析数据的结构关系（如单调性、非线性、相关性）生成结构化描述，并建立反馈循环优化方程生成。

Conclusion: DrSR通过闭环集成数据理解和生成反思，为科学方程发现提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

Conclusion: PANN为资源受限的机载处理提供了一种高效解决方案，有望提升自然灾害数据的实时处理能力。

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

Result: ALBAT在数据稀缺的个性化和语言生成任务中显著提升了适应训练效果。

Conclusion: BAT和ALBAT为适应训练提供了一种高效的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including
diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models.
While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data
used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training
(BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset.
First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

Motivation: 计算精确的Shapley值在特征维度上是指数级的，现有随机估计器缺乏理论保证。

Method: 提出一个统一框架，涵盖KernelSHAP及相关估计器，证明非渐近理论保证，并进行实验验证。

Result: 在中小维度数据集上验证了方法的有效性，并在高维数据集上实现了可扩展性改进。

Conclusion: 该框架为KernelSHAP提供了首个理论保证，并通过实验展示了其优越性。

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

have emerged to tackle user privacy concerns and efficiency in embedded
systems. Even more recently, an efficient federated anomaly detection
algorithm, FLiForest, based on Isolation Forests has been developed, offering a
low-resource, unsupervised method well-suited for edge deployment and

systems running MicroPython. The system has been experimentally evaluated,
achieving over 96% accuracy in distinguishing normal from abnormal readings and
above 78% precision in detecting anomalies across all tested configurations,
while maintaining a memory usage below 160 KB during model training. These
results highlight its suitability for resource-constrained environments and
edge systems, while upholding federated learning principles of data privacy and
collaborative learning.

Result: IWL能自然推广传递推理，而ICL需预训练才能实现类似效果。预训练任务的结构性有助于上下文关系推理。

Conclusion: 预训练任务的结构性对模型上下文关系推理能力有重要影响。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

Result: 找到了每种方法的最优收敛率，并提供了匹配的下界。

Conclusion: 分析提供了清晰的性能保证，并揭示了EF、EF21和压缩梯度下降的机制差异。

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合Lyapunov漂移加惩罚算法与强化学习（RL）的新方法LDPTRLQ，通过理论分析和仿真验证其在队列稳定性和长期优化上的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网（IoT）设备的普及，解决复杂优化问题的需求增加。现有方法在结合Lyapunov漂移加惩罚算法与RL时存在不足，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 提出LDPTRLQ算法，通过理论分析将Lyapunov漂移加惩罚算法与RL结合，平衡短期贪婪优化与长期视角。

Result: 仿真结果表明LDPTRLQ在队列稳定性和性能上优于基线方法，验证了理论推导的有效性。

Conclusion: LDPTRLQ算法在兼容性和稳定性上表现优异，为IoT设备优化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed
algorithm, termed Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method tailored for reinforcement
learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for
multiple problems demonstrate that LDPTRLQ outperforms the baseline methods
using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

TL;DR: AutoCT结合大型语言模型和经典机器学习，提出了一种可解释且高效的临床试验预测框架，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床试验成本高且耗时，准确预测其结果可降低成本并加速药物研发。现有深度学习模型缺乏可解释性且易受标签泄漏影响。

Method: AutoCT框架结合语言模型和机器学习，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索自主生成、评估和优化特征。

Result: AutoCT在少量迭代中性能达到或优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AutoCT为临床试验预测提供了可扩展、可解释且经济高效的新范式。

Abstract: Clinical trials are critical for advancing medical treatments but remain
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accurate prediction of clinical
trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and
accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise
by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of
interpretability, and vulnerability to label leakage limit their practical use
in high-stakes biomedical contexts. In this work, we propose AutoCT, a novel
framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models
with the explainability of classical machine learning. AutoCT autonomously
generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features based on public information
without human input. Our method uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively
optimize predictive performance. Experimental results show that AutoCT performs
on par with or better than SOTA methods on clinical trial prediction tasks
within only a limited number of self-refinement iterations, establishing a new
paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial
prediction.

Abstract: Ensuring grid stability in the transition to renewable energy sources
requires accurate power demand forecasting. This study addresses the need for
precise forecasting by differentiating among industrial, commercial, and
residential consumers through customer clusterisation, tailoring the
forecasting models to capture the unique consumption patterns of each group. A
feature selection process is done for each consumer type including temporal,
socio-economic, and weather-related data obtained from the Copernicus Earth
Observation (EO) program. A variety of AI and machine learning algorithms for
Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) and Very Short-Term Load Forecasting (VSTLF)
are explored and compared, determining the most effective approaches. With all
that, the main contribution of this work are the new forecasting approaches
proposed, which have demonstrated superior performance compared to simpler
models, both for STLF and VSTLF, highlighting the importance of customized
forecasting strategies for different consumer groups and demonstrating the
impact of incorporating detailed weather data on forecasting accuracy. These
advancements contribute to more reliable power demand predictions, thereby
supporting grid stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合真实数据和合成数据的深度学习框架，用于预测露天矿运输车队容量，XGBoost和LSTM模型表现接近，SHAP分析揭示了关键影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 露天矿运输车队容量受天气、机械故障和人员变动等多因素影响，需高精度短期预测以应对不确定性。

Method: 结合高分辨率降雨数据、车队性能遥测和合成机械故障场景，评估XGBoost和LSTM模型。

Result: XGBoost的MedAE为14.3%，LSTM为15.1%，模拟故障数据和班次计划特征显著降低预测波动。

Conclusion: 未来将整合更多维护和人力资源数据，提升预测鲁棒性，为动态不确定条件下的车队管理提供决策支持。

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in
open-pit mining, where weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and
variable crew availability introduce significant operational uncertainties. We
propose a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records
(high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with
synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to enable the model to
capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. We evaluate two architectures:
an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,
historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant
predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features
notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate
maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to
Repair), detailed human resource data (operator absenteeism, crew efficiency
metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance
forecast robustness and adaptability. This hybrid modelling approach offers a
comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management
under dynamically uncertain conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种4步流程，通过softlog-softmax级联提升下一代集成学习系统的一致性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决集成学习系统的一致性和可靠性问题，尤其是在复杂问题中。

Method: 1. 解剖学过程：选择多样性标准构建目标集成模型；2. 生理学过程：通过softlog-softmax层实现中间决策；3. 信息理论过程：提出基于softlog的熵和散度；4. 性能评估过程：推导信息性能张量。

Result: 证明了在复杂问题中，集成多样性更有用，且提出的方法能提升一致性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过4步流程，成功提升了集成学习系统的一致性和可靠性。

Abstract: The paper proposes a 4-step process for highlighting that softlog-softmax
cascades can improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation
ensemble learning systems. The first process is anatomical in nature: the
target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements
relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is
considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

Method: 通过量化不同代理设计和测试扩展策略下的资源使用、延迟行为、能耗和数据中心功耗，分析设计选择对准确性-成本权衡的影响。

Result: 研究发现，尽管AI代理通过增加计算提升准确性，但存在回报递减、延迟方差扩大和基础设施成本不可持续的问题。

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under
real-world constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于RFT的红队测试方法缺乏统一基准，且实现细节（如PPO）影响结果的稳定性和可复现性。

Result: 通过广泛的消融研究，明确了LoRA、KL散度和拉格朗日乘数等关键组件对RFT性能的影响。

Conclusion: RedRFT有助于全面理解RFT红队测试算法的实现细节，并支持快速原型开发。

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red
teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current
RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and
reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight
benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and
evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of
both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality
single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such
as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence
diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that
facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT
performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,
including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and
Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red
teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features
for RFT-based red teaming. Code for the benchmark can be accessed at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为YOTO的方法，通过一次性训练自动优化损失权重超参数，避免了传统的网格搜索方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要多次训练和调整损失权重超参数，效率低下。YOTO旨在通过一次性训练解决这一问题。

Method: 将损失权重超参数视为网络参数，通过梯度优化自动学习，并引入新的正则化损失函数。

Result: 在3D估计和语义分割任务中，YOTO优于传统网格搜索方法。

Conclusion: YOTO提供了一种高效且性能优越的损失权重优化方法。

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少深度网络中隐藏层的可调参数数量，同时保持模型性能，探索随机连接的正则化效果。

Method: 设计“半”隐藏单元，分为两阶段：固定随机权重的输入加权和，再通过两个可调权重进行缩放和平移，最后通过非线性激活函数。

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上实验表明，半隐藏层能以较少的参数实现合理准确率。

Conclusion: 半隐藏层通过随机连接的正则化效果，为减少网络参数提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

Result: 该框架为复杂交易环境中构建稳健的多目标奖励函数提供了通用蓝图，并可扩展其他风险度量或自适应权重。

Abstract: We propose a novel composite reward function for reinforcement learning in

terms: annualized return downside risk differential return and the Treynor

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

Result: 发现回放样本可能导致非单调遗忘，甚至在某些情况下有害，且回放效果依赖于样本选择和任务关系。

Conclusion: 样本回放的效果复杂，需谨慎选择回放样本和考虑任务关系。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移除目标网络虽能释放内存并利用最新估计，但会导致性能不稳定。希望找到一种折中方案，既能减少内存占用，又能保持性能。

Method: 使用在线网络的最后一层线性层副本作为目标网络，其余参数共享，结合迭代Q学习，减少目标网络移除的性能差距。

Result: iS-QL方法在多种设置下提升了目标无关方法的样本效率，且内存占用更小，训练时间与传统目标方法相当。

Conclusion: iS-QL为强化学习研究提供了一种可扩展的新方法，平衡了性能与资源消耗。

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

Conclusion: UMCNP在样本效率和任务适应性方面表现出色，适用于复杂元强化学习场景。

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

Conclusion: 自监督对比学习隐式逼近监督学习目标，其表示支持准确的few-shot分类，理论分析与实验结果一致。

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

TL;DR: KOALA++是一种基于卡尔曼滤波的优化算法，通过显式建模梯度不确定性提升神经网络训练效率，避免了二阶方法的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决二阶优化方法计算成本高的问题，同时捕捉更丰富的梯度不确定性结构。

Method: 通过递归更新紧凑的梯度协方差积来直接估计参数协方差矩阵，避免存储完整协方差矩阵和大规模矩阵求逆。

Result: 在图像分类和语言建模等任务中，KOALA++的精度与一流的一阶和二阶优化器相当或更好，同时保持一阶方法的效率。

Conclusion: KOALA++在性能和效率之间取得了平衡，为神经网络训练提供了一种高效的优化方案。

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

*Hari K. Prakash,Charles H. Martin*

TL;DR: 论文研究了神经网络中的grokking现象，发现了一个新的第三阶段——anti-grokking，并通过HTSR指标α揭示了其特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络训练中的grokking现象，特别是其潜在的anti-grokking阶段，以更好地理解过拟合和泛化崩溃。

Method: 使用3层MLP在MNIST子集上训练，结合WeightWatcher工具分析HTSR指标α，并通过随机化层权重矩阵和Kolmogorov-Smirnov测试验证结果。

Result: 发现anti-grokking阶段，其特征是测试精度崩溃而训练精度保持完美，且HTSR指标α能有效区分所有三个阶段。

Conclusion: HTSR指标α是衡量泛化的有效工具，其目标值约为2，可用于检测过拟合和泛化崩溃。

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

TL;DR: RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) 是一种离散流匹配框架，用于单步逆合成规划，通过反应中心识别和Feynman-Kac引导提升生成反应的多样性和可行性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决有机化学中单步逆合成预测的挑战，现有方法在准确性和多样性上表现不足。

Method: 采用离散流匹配框架，结合反应中心识别和Feynman-Kac引导，利用Sequential Monte Carlo重采样优化生成结果。

Result: RSF在top-1准确率上达到60%，比现有方法提升20%；top-5往返准确率提升19%。

Conclusion: RSF通过新颖的框架和引导策略，显著提升了单步逆合成的准确性和多样性，为化学合成规划提供了有效工具。

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

Motivation: 在许多应用中，某些区域的预测准确性比其他区域更重要，但传统损失函数未能有效区分这些区域的重要性。

Method: 设计了基于Sigmoid和双曲正弦链接的选择性标量损失函数，并扩展为多维选择性损失框架，克服了标准Softmax在多分类中的局限性。

Result: 选择性损失函数在多个应用中（如停留时间预测、检索、排名等）显著优于传统损失函数。

Conclusion: 选择性损失函数能够有效解决模型在关键区域的预测问题，适用于多种任务，包括大语言模型的微调对齐。

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Motivation: 网络入侵检测系统面临日益复杂的网络威胁，需要更鲁棒、可解释且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Method: 扩展ODXU框架，结合深度嵌入聚类、XGBoost符号推理和不确定性量化方法（如SHAP值和信息增益）。

Result: 在CIC-IDS-2017数据集上，ODXU在六项评估指标中优于传统神经模型。迁移学习策略在ACI-IoT-2023数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: ODXU框架在网络安全中表现出色，迁移学习策略进一步提升了其适用性，且基于元模型的不确定性量化方法优于基于分数的方法。

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in protecting
digital infrastructures against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In
this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates
deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using
XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance
robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU
incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)
and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to
assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017
dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six
evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.
While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not
been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning
strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different
dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal
transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining
the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms
traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples
(approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that
metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on
both datasets.

Motivation: 系统性是组合性的核心，能提升模型在新情境下的泛化能力，但现有研究多关注行为系统性，忽视了表征系统性。

Method: 基于Hadley的分类法，分析了语言和视觉领域的关键基准对行为系统性的测试程度，并借鉴机制可解释性领域的方法评估表征系统性。

Result: 现有基准主要测试行为系统性，而表征系统性的评估方法在机制可解释性领域已有实践。

Conclusion: 强调区分行为与表征系统性的重要性，并呼吁在ML模型中更全面地评估系统性。

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental
providers using a 2018 dataset. A dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features
was analyzed, including beneficiary and service counts across fee-for-service

categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and
recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%),
followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine

Conclusion: 高效预测LLM适应结果是可行的，能显著减少计算开销，同时维持性能标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

Conclusion: CryoBoltz为动态生物分子系统的结构建模提供了一种灵活且强大的方法。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of
dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm
that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the
inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical
reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses
random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient
updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense
network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental
hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical
reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant
energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers offer a powerful tool for modeling complex dynamical
systems, but often struggle with error accumulation over long time horizons and
maintaining stability and physical consistency. We introduce a multiscale
implicit neural emulator that enhances long-term prediction accuracy by
conditioning on a hierarchy of lower-dimensional future state representations.
Drawing inspiration from the stability properties of numerical implicit
time-stepping methods, our approach leverages predictions several steps ahead
in time at increasing compression rates for next-timestep refinements. By
actively adjusting the temporal downsampling ratios, our design enables the
model to capture dynamics across multiple granularities and enforce long-range
temporal coherence. Experiments on turbulent fluid dynamics show that our
method achieves high short-term accuracy and produces long-term stable
forecasts, significantly outperforming autoregressive baselines while adding
minimal computational overhead.

Motivation: 地理分布式加速器训练LLM时存在高昂的跨区域通信成本和硬件利用率不均问题。

Method: 提出HALoS框架，使用本地参数服务器（LPS）和全局参数服务器（GPS）分层优化，减少跨区域通信并利用快速区域内链接。

Result: HALoS在非凸目标下收敛性良好，比同步基线快7.5倍，比现有异步方法快2.1倍，同时保持模型质量。

Conclusion: HALoS的分层设计和服务器端更新累积是地理分布式环境中高效训练LLM的有效工具。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on geographically
distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across
regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware. We propose HALoS, a
hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that tackles these issues by
introducing local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global
parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical
design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler
effects, and leverages fast intra-region links. We provide a rigorous
convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including
theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous
training. Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than
synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon
existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the
model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on
standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially
lowering total training time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical,
server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for
scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed

TL;DR: NOBLE是一种神经算子框架，通过学习神经元特征的连续频率调制嵌入到电压响应的映射，解决了传统生物神经元模型的局限性，实现了高效生成具有实验变异性的合成神经元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生物神经元模型受限于实验数据的有限性和变异性，传统方法难以扩展，深度学习又无法完全捕捉神经元的生物物理复杂性。

Method: NOBLE通过学习神经元特征的嵌入到电压响应的映射，利用生物物理真实神经元模型生成的数据进行训练，预测神经动力学的分布。

Result: NOBLE在真实实验数据上验证，实现了4200倍的速度提升，并能生成具有实验变异性的合成神经元。

Conclusion: NOBLE为理解神经元组成、计算及神经AI应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural MJD是一种基于神经网络的非平稳Merton跳跃扩散模型，通过显式建模随机微分方程（SDE）来预测时间序列，解决了传统深度学习方法在非平稳数据上的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在非平稳时间序列预测中表现不佳，尤其是面对突变时，因其黑盒性质和无法显式建模随机过程。

Method: 结合时间非齐次Itô扩散和时间非齐次复合泊松过程，提出似然截断机制和Euler-Maruyama重启求解器。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，Neural MJD优于现有深度学习和统计学习方法。

Conclusion: Neural MJD通过显式建模随机过程，显著提升了非平稳时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在大规模数据集和多设备参与时面临瓶颈，且数据分布不均影响性能。量子联邦学习（QFL）背景下，这些问题尤为突出。

Method: 提出mdQFL算法，结合训练和更新个性化，以及测试泛化能力，适用于QFL及其他联邦学习场景。

Conclusion: mdQFL在量子联邦学习中高效且适应性强，为联邦学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Training with huge datasets and a large number of participating devices leads
to bottlenecks in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, the challenges of
heterogeneity between multiple FL clients affect the overall performance of the
system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled
datasets to make data-driven discoveries in critical domains such as climate
science, biomedicine, astronomy, chemistry, and more. However, despite its
widespread utilization, there is a lack of standardization in unsupervised
learning workflows for making reliable and reproducible scientific discoveries.
In this paper, we present a structured workflow for using unsupervised learning
techniques in science. We highlight and discuss best practices starting with
formulating validatable scientific questions, conducting robust data
preparation and exploration, using a range of modeling techniques, performing
rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of
unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and
documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To
illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy,
seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their
chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation
and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for
unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

Motivation: 现有方法通过均匀采样敏感输入生成合成文本，但在异构主题下效果不佳。

Method: 聚类输入数据后选择推理批次，并通过私有计算中位数聚合下一个令牌的统计信息。

Result: 方法在代表性指标（如MAUVE）和下游任务性能上表现更好，隐私成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 聚类和私有中位数聚合方法能生成高质量合成数据，且隐私保护更强。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

Result: 结果显示MaMMUT在扩展性和样本效率上优于CLIP，并在多个数据集和任务中表现一致。

Conclusion: 结论指出扩展定律的准确推导为模型和数据集比较提供了系统方法，有助于开放基础模型和数据集的改进。

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for
reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at

Motivation: 在关键领域使用GNN时，可靠的解释对决策至关重要，但对称化操作会丢失方向信息，影响解释的准确性。

Method: 通过理论和实证研究，分析方向信息对解释质量的影响。

Result: 保留方向语义显著提升了解释的忠实性。

Conclusion: 在安全关键应用中，方向感知的GNN解释方法至关重要。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in critical domains, where
reliable explanations are vital for supporting human decision-making. However,
the common practice of graph symmetrization discards directional information,
leading to significant information loss and misleading explanations. Our
analysis demonstrates how this practice compromises explanation fidelity.
Through theoretical and empirical studies, we show that preserving directional
semantics significantly improves explanation quality, ensuring more faithful
insights for human decision-makers. These findings highlight the need for
direction-aware GNN explainability in security-critical applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过双向边界训练能量模型（EBM）的方法，以解决传统训练中的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能量模型（EBM）在密度估计中具有优雅的框架，但训练困难。传统方法通过极小化下界训练，但会导致不稳定性。

Method: 提出使用双向边界（最大化下界和极小化上界）训练EBM，研究了四种不同的对数似然边界，并提供了评估算法。

Result: 双向边界方法稳定了EBM训练，实现了高质量的密度估计和样本生成。

Conclusion: 双向边界方法有效解决了EBM训练中的不稳定性问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Result: 算法在视频游戏控制基准测试中有效近似了尾部风险，并找到了最优代理组合。

Conclusion: 该框架为代理组合的风险优化提供了理论保证和实用工具，适用于复杂任务场景。

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

Conclusion: 神经网络可重编程性是高效模型适应的基本范式，揭示了现有技术的理论联系和实际区别，并指出了未来的研究方向。

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

Result: 证明经典方法（如跳跃连接和归一化）可成功堆叠深度GNN层而不降低性能。

Conclusion: 澄清了关于过度平滑的误解，为深度GNN的潜力提供了新视角。

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升PML中标签识别和特征选择能力。

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight
matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability
to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

Motivation: 联邦学习中数据非独立同分布和模态多样性导致单一模型不适用，部分个性化可能加剧客户端漂移。

Method: 使用ADMM框架，构建包含一阶和二阶近端项的增广拉格朗日函数，显式估计拉格朗日乘子。

Result: FedAPM在收敛速度和精度上优于现有方法，测试准确率、F1分数和AUC分别平均提升12.3%、16.4%和18.0%。

Conclusion: FedAPM通过稳定高效的收敛性能，有效解决了联邦学习中的客户端漂移问题。

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in
forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and
retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective
forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

TL;DR: DIPNet通过将输入投影到可学习的分布中，平滑损失景观，提升泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过参数化模型下，训练损失对泛化性能的指导有限，平滑性虽与泛化相关，但直接实现困难。

Method: 提出DIPNet框架，将输入投影为每层的可学习分布，理论分析显示其降低局部平滑度和Lipschitz常数。

Result: 在ViTs、LLMs、ResNet和MLPs等多种架构和任务中验证，提升测试性能，包括对抗攻击和分布外输入。

Conclusion: DIPNet是一种通用有效的方法，可无缝集成到现有模型中，提升深度学习泛化性能。

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

Result: 实验证明该方法能准确预测GNNs中边操作的影响，并适用于图重连和对抗攻击等应用。

Conclusion: 该方法为GNNs的影响预测提供了更灵活和准确的工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: RLVR的理论分析深化了对强化学习在模型微调中作用的理解，并为提升推理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 干旱对孟加拉国的农业和社会经济稳定构成重大威胁，传统干旱指数和现有机器学习模型未能充分考虑土壤湿度和温度等因素，且缺乏对多地区卫星数据的整合。

Method: 采用无监督算法（如K-means和贝叶斯高斯混合模型）进行聚类，随后使用KNN、随机森林、决策树和朴素贝叶斯等分类模型，结合2012-2024年的气象数据（湿度、土壤湿度、温度）。

Result: 该框架成功将干旱严重程度分类为不同等级，但显示出各地区干旱脆弱性的显著差异。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在识别和预测干旱条件方面表现出潜力，但需进一步优化以应对区域差异。

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

Motivation: 传统基于排名的统计度量（如ISL）在训练隐式生成模型时存在局限性，需要一种更鲁棒且高效的方法。

Method: 提出了dual-ISL目标函数，通过交换目标分布和模型分布的角色，将其转化为模型密度空间中的凸优化问题，并分析了其数学性质。

Result: dual-ISL在收敛速度、训练稳定性和防止模式崩溃方面优于传统ISL和其他方法，同时提供了显式密度近似。

Conclusion: dual-ISL是一种理论上优越且实用的隐式生成模型训练方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

Motivation: 随着生成模型的广泛应用，如何在隐私、法律或内容修正需求下选择性移除数据影响变得至关重要。传统方法需要从头训练，成本高昂。

Method: 提出基于损失梯度正交化的快速遗忘算法，确保遗忘不需要的数据同时保持生成质量和模型参数。

Result: 在MNIST和CelebA数据集上，算法比梯度手术等方法快几个数量级，且能有效遗忘数据并保持模型保真度。

Conclusion: 该算法为生成模型中的选择性遗忘提供了一种高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

Motivation: 标准GRPO在复杂推理链中因缺乏中间监督导致探索效率低和训练不稳定。

Method: MGRPO采用双层GRPO：首层生成初始响应，第二层纠正错误，形成自我纠正循环。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，MGRPO显著优于标准GRPO。

Conclusion: MGRPO通过隐式过程监督提升推理和自我纠正能力，解决了GRPO的局限性。

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

Motivation: 传统注意力机制（如Transformer）的二次计算和线性内存复杂度是瓶颈，而线性注意力和状态空间模型虽然高效，但受限于固定大小的隐藏状态。

Method: 开发了log-linear attention，用对数增长的隐藏状态集替代固定大小隐藏状态，并通过特定增长函数实现类似线性注意力的并行计算。

Result: 在Mamba-2和Gated DeltaNet等架构上实例化log-linear attention，表现优于线性时间变体。

Conclusion: log-linear attention是一种通用框架，兼具高效性和表达力，适用于现有线性注意力变体。

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph
transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and
generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training
and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at

Result: 新算法达到更优的后悔上界，并证明更紧的下界。

Conclusion: 算法在重尾奖励下表现优越，适用于多种几何结构和无限维设置。

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

Conclusion: 研究为VQ中的QUBO公式提供了新的几何解释，并统一了两种方法的理论框架。

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

Motivation: 探讨Adam优化器在训练神经网络时损失突增现象的根本原因。

Method: 分析Adam优化器中平方梯度与二阶矩估计的关系，发现当平方梯度显著小于二阶矩估计时，后者因指数衰减而响应迟缓，导致预条件Hessian矩阵的最大特征值超过稳定性阈值，引发不稳定。

Result: 实验验证了该机制在多种网络架构（全连接网络、卷积网络、Transformer）中的普适性。

Conclusion: Adam优化器的自适应预条件器本身是损失突增的触发因素，这一发现为优化器设计和训练稳定性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

Result: 训练显著提升了模型在数学任务中的表现，尤其是需要多步推理的中等难度问题。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑谜题的强化学习可以重塑LLMs的内部推理机制，实现更鲁棒和组合式的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

### [107] [Sparse Autoencoders, Again?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04859)
*Yin Lu,Tong He,Xuening Zhu,David Wipf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合模型，解决了传统稀疏自编码器（SAEs）和变分自编码器（VAEs）的局限性，并在理论和实验上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SAEs和VAEs在处理低维潜在结构时存在局限性，需要一种更有效的模型来改进稀疏表示和重建性能。

Method: 提出了一种混合模型，结合了SAEs和VAEs的优点，并通过理论证明和实验验证其有效性。

Result: 新模型在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，能够更准确地估计潜在维度并生成更稀疏的表示，同时保持低重建误差。

Conclusion: 混合模型在图像和语言模型激活模式等领域超越了传统SAEs、VAEs和扩散模型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了对比损失在多模态表示学习中的局限性，提出了一种正则化方法以提高表示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比损失无法有效学习对齐表示空间，原因是表示空间中存在模态特定信息。

Method: 通过信息瓶颈原理分析问题，提出基于变分近似的正则化损失函数。

Result: 实验验证了正则化方法的有效性，提升了表示对齐。

Conclusion: 提出的正则化方法能有效减少模态特定信息，改善多模态表示学习。

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的概念瓶颈模型（MCBMs），通过引入信息瓶颈目标来确保每个表示组件仅保留与其对应概念相关的信息，从而提升模型的解释性和干预有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）虽然能预测预定义概念，但无法保证表示组件仅编码该概念信息，这影响了模型的解释性和干预效果。

Method: 提出最小概念瓶颈模型（MCBMs），通过变分正则化项实现信息瓶颈目标，约束表示组件仅保留与概念相关的信息。

Result: MCBMs支持具有理论保证的概念级干预，符合贝叶斯原则，并在设计选择上更具灵活性。

Conclusion: MCBMs通过信息瓶颈目标解决了CBMs的局限性，提升了模型的解释性和干预有效性。

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于高斯过程变形统计形状模型（GPDSSM）的半自动化分类方法，用于通过CT扫描诊断髋关节发育不良，提高了分类准确性并节省了临床时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 髋关节发育不良是骨关节炎的风险因素，早期诊断可通过手术干预降低风险。传统方法依赖手动测量和2D扫描，效率低且准确性有限。

Method: 结合高斯过程潜在变量模型和微分同胚，构建统计形状模型GPDSSM，使用192例CT扫描数据（100训练，92测试）进行半自动化分类。

Result: GPDSSM能有效区分发育不良样本，AUC达96.2%，优于传统角度测量方法（91.2%），并减少了临床手动操作时间。

Conclusion: GPDSSM为髋关节发育不良诊断提供了高效、准确的工具，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Motivation: 早期识别ICU高风险患者对医疗资源分配至关重要，但现有方法在性能和实用性上存在不足。

Method: ALFIA结合LoRA适配器和自适应层加权机制，从BERT主干中融合多层语义特征，并在cw-24基准上训练。

Result: ALFIA在AUPRC上超越现有表格分类器，并支持与GBDT和深度神经网络的结合，进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is crucial for directing
limited medical resources. We introduce ALFIA (Adaptive Layer Fusion with
Intelligent Attention), a modular, attention-based architecture that jointly
trains LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters and an adaptive layer-weighting
mechanism to fuse multi-layer semantic features from a BERT backbone. Trained
on our rigorous cw-24 (CriticalWindow-24) benchmark, ALFIA surpasses
state-of-the-art tabular classifiers in AUPRC while preserving a balanced
precision-recall profile. The embeddings produced by ALFIA's fusion module,
capturing both fine-grained clinical cues and high-level concepts, enable
seamless pairing with GBDTs (CatBoost/LightGBM) as ALFIA-boost, and deep neuro
networks as ALFIA-nn, yielding additional performance gains. Our experiments
confirm ALFIA's superior early-warning performance, by operating directly on
routine clinical text, it furnishes clinicians with a convenient yet robust
tool for risk stratification and timely intervention in critical-care settings.

Motivation: 工业4.0的复杂性促使需要更简化的人机交互方式，以支持工业5.0的人类中心化、可持续和弹性目标。

Method: 通过意图分解将高层业务目标转化为可执行任务，并利用子代理和工具完成领域特定任务。

Conclusion: 该方法有望降低技术障碍并实现可扩展的意图驱动自动化，尽管存在数据质量和可解释性问题。

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large
language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities,
enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,
originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction
(HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable,
and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing,
the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the
CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the
feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous
decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the
potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable,
intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.

TL;DR: FPTQuant是一种用于量化大型语言模型（LLM）的新方法，通过四种轻量级函数保持变换（FPTs）优化激活分布，实现高效INT4量化，性能接近全精度模型，速度提升达3.9倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理时计算和能耗高，传统量化方法因大范围异常值导致性能下降。FPTQuant旨在通过函数保持变换解决这一问题。

Method: 提出四种FPTs：预RoPE变换、值变换、MLP块内缩放变换和动态缩放变换，利用变换器的等变性和独立性优化激活分布，无需定制内核。

Result: 实现静态INT4量化，速度提升3.9倍，精度与全精度模型接近，优于多数现有方法。

Conclusion: FPTQuant在精度与速度间取得优异平衡，是高效量化LLM的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at
inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at
improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade
performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,
which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

Motivation: 旨在证明自适应调整学习速度的加速无遗憾学习并非孤立现象，并探索在一般游戏中实现快速学习的新途径。

Method: 提出了Cautious Optimism框架，基于FTRL实例，通过最小计算开销调整学习速度，实现加速无遗憾学习。

Result: 在自对弈中实现了接近最优的O_T(log T)遗憾，同时在对抗场景中保持了最优的O(√T)遗憾。

Conclusion: Cautious Optimism为一般游戏中的快速学习提供了一种新方法，且不依赖于单调步长。

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

Conclusion: MPP编码是一种通用且高效的矢量地理空间数据编码方法，适用于各种形状和机器学习任务。

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

Conclusion: 当前PLL方法存在局限性，基础模型的应用为未来研究提供了方向。PartialCLIP展示了文本嵌入和标签过滤的有效性。

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

Method: 通过合成数据模型和系统实验，研究跨类特征在AT中的作用，分析模型在不同训练阶段的特征学习动态。

Result: 实验表明，AT初期模型倾向于学习跨类特征，达到最佳鲁棒性后，逐渐转向依赖类特定特征，导致鲁棒过拟合。

Conclusion: 本文提供了对AT机制的新理解，统一了软标签训练和鲁棒过拟合的现有观点，为AT研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is

Result: TIMING在合成和真实时间序列基准测试中优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: TIMING通过时间感知改进IG，显著提升了时间序列XAI的性能。

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including
the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec
(iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes
unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure
to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments
on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective
approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using
iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to
6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen
nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing
embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a
versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to
reproduce the results is available at https://github.com/Foisunt/iN2V .

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为D3M的监控算法，用于检测模型部署后的性能退化（PDD），通过预测模型的分歧实现高效监控，并在实际数据中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中数据分布会随时间变化，导致模型性能下降，但并非所有变化都会影响性能。如何在无标签情况下判断何时需要重新训练模型是一个开放性问题。

Method: 提出D3M算法，基于预测模型的分歧来监控性能退化，确保在非退化变化下低误报率，在退化变化下高检测率。

Result: 在标准基准和真实世界医学数据集上的实验表明，D3M能有效监控性能退化，适合作为高风险机器学习管道的预警机制。

Conclusion: D3M是一种实用且高效的监控方法，能够可靠地检测模型性能退化，为动态环境中的模型维护提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in
dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without
access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade
model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

Result: 实验表明，NIMO能恢复线性系数并显著提升预测精度，优于其他混合方法。

Conclusion: NIMO成功结合了神经网络和线性模型的优点，既保持可解释性又提升性能。

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

TL;DR: 论文扩展了HiPPO框架，提出了一种考虑测量噪声的状态空间模型初始化方法，提高了模型的抗噪能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HiPPO框架假设数据无噪声，但实际数据常含噪声，需要改进以适应现实场景。

Method: 将HiPPO重新建模为线性随机控制问题，数据作为噪声输出，推导出新的动态初始化方法。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在训练和推理时均提高了模型对噪声的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了HiPPO在噪声数据下的局限性，且不增加计算成本。

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

Motivation: 现有半隐式变分推理方法在高维场景下训练成本高且存在偏差和高方差问题。

Method: 引入核化KL散度估计器进行非参数平滑，结合重要性采样校正，理论关联Stein变分梯度下降。

Result: 方法在性能和训练效率上优于或匹配现有SIVI方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过降低梯度方差和良性偏差，实现了更稳定高效的优化。

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

Result: 发现种子控制会导致隐私泄露，而随机输入能增强隐私保护。

Conclusion: 线性回归的发现为未来更广泛的隐私界限研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

Method: 利用Morse-Smale动力系统作为理论框架，分析梯度联想记忆模型和扩散模型的结构稳定性，并通过分岔理论描述学习与生成景观的稳定性。

Result: 研究表明，联想记忆学习景观和扩散模型在零噪声极限下具有稳定性，仅在某些孤立点出现分岔。

Conclusion: 论文通过分岔理论揭示了生成与记忆转换的通用性质，并提供了经典和现代Hopfield网络的结构稳定性判据。

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在全轨迹级别定义的奖励无法为推理过程的中间步骤提供足够指导，限制了模型性能。

Method: TreeRPO通过树采样直接估计推理步骤的奖励，并基于GRPO的组相对奖励机制计算细粒度奖励信号。

Result: 实验显示，TreeRPO将Qwen-2.5-Math的Pass@1准确率从19.0%提升至35.5%，性能优于GRPO且响应长度减少18.1%。

Conclusion: TreeRPO通过细粒度奖励信号显著提升了LLMs的推理能力和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness
and efficiency. Our code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散重排序方法在数据流形建模中有效，但信号在远离源点时衰减，导致局部区域外的判别力下降。

Result: 实验结果表明，LPMT在多种任务中有效提升了实例检索的性能。

Conclusion: LPMT通过保留局部性和全局检索的平衡，显著提升了实例检索的效果。

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a
long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate
manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion
processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local
consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic
Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while
maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks
confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何通过上下文学习实现任务预测，超越传统优化算法逼近的限制。

Method: 构建一个能够基于少量上下文示例进行可靠预测的Transformer模型，采用通用函数逼近方法。

Result: 证明了Transformer可以动态适应上下文示例，同时学习通用表示，适用于非凸问题和线性函数类。

Conclusion: 该理论为Transformer的上下文学习能力提供了新的解释，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

Motivation: GNN在节点分类任务中存在度偏差问题，现有GCL方法因正样本对数量有限和权重分配不均导致低度节点信息不足。

Method: 提出HAR对比损失，利用节点标签增加正样本对，并根据学习难度自适应加权正负样本对。开发SHARP实验框架扩展HAR应用范围。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，SHARP在全局和度级别均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HAR和SHARP能有效缓解GNN中的度偏差问题，提升节点分类性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

Motivation: 现有分散式鲁棒核学习方法多为分治法，缺乏统一框架，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用RKHS框架和鲁棒损失函数，设计分散式算法，并通过核积分算子技术分析收敛性。

Result: 算法在均方距离、RKHS范数和泛化误差上均达到最优学习率，鲁棒性参数σ对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 分散化、样本选择、鲁棒性和收敛性之间存在内在联系，算法在理论和实践上均表现优越。

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

Motivation: Transformer 模型在处理长上下文时存在二次时间和线性内存复杂度的限制，而 RMT 虽然降低了复杂度，但其顺序执行机制成为性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出 Diagonal Batching，通过重新排序运行时计算，实现跨片段的并行化，同时保持精确的递归关系。

Result: 在 LLaMA-1B ARMT 模型上，Diagonal Batching 比标准全注意力 LLaMA-1B 快 3.3 倍，比顺序 RMT 实现快 1.8 倍。

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching 消除了顺序瓶颈，降低了推理成本和延迟，使 RMT 成为实际长上下文应用的可行解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

Motivation: 现有神经采样器在目标评估效率上仍不及并行退火（PT），且PT生成依赖样本且计算成本高。

Method: PTSD通过温度序列训练扩散模型，结合PT优势，并引入新方法生成近似低温样本，再用MCMC微调。

Result: PTSD显著提升了目标评估效率，优于基于扩散的神经采样器。

Conclusion: PTSD通过结合PT和扩散模型，实现了高效且不相关的样本生成。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the
process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant
advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach,
Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations.
On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only
dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost
-- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose
the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion
models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to
improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to
combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate
lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to
train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample
information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated
samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency,
outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

Conclusion: 研究展示了通过增加推理时计算成本优化性能的潜力，为序列建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是开发一种符合物理原理的学习算法，以高效模拟和设计动态系统，特别是非耗散的哈密顿系统。

Method: 方法包括提出RHEL算法，证明其通过物理轨迹计算梯度，并扩展到离散时间和分层结构（HSSMs）。

Result: 结果表明RHEL在多种时间序列任务上与BPTT性能相当，且适用于长序列（约50k）。

Conclusion: 结论是RHEL为设计可扩展、高效的自学习物理系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

Result: 实验表明，该框架在不同数据集和模型上均有效，实现了精确的局部控制和时间一致性。

Conclusion: CocktailEdit填补了纯生成模型与实际编辑需求之间的鸿沟，为时间序列生成和编辑提供了灵活解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,
offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and
editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI行业中，训练数据的价值和版权保护至关重要，但传统Shapley值计算方法计算复杂度高，且需要为每个测试样本重新训练，成本难以承受。

Method: 利用加权最小二乘法的Shapley值特性，训练一个可重用的解释模型，并提出三种方法降低训练开销。

Result: 实验证明，性能提升至2.5倍以上，训练速度提高两个数量级。

Conclusion: Fast-DataShapley在计算效率和性能上显著优于基线方法，适用于实时推理场景。

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: 储层计算具备在没有显式先验的情况下实现泛化的潜力。

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆（BC）方法仅能模仿专家在特定状态下的行为，无法在遇到未见状态时恢复。论文旨在通过L2S方法，使代理能够独立推理并恢复专家行为。

Method: SAILOR方法结合了世界模型和奖励模型，通过算法和设计决策实现稳定且高效的恢复行为学习，无需额外人工修正。

Result: 在多个视觉操作任务中，SAILOR显著优于基于BC的扩散策略，即使增加BC的演示数据量仍存在性能差距。

Conclusion: SAILOR能够识别细微错误并避免奖励欺骗，是一种高效且稳健的模仿学习方法。

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .

Conclusion: 自校正方法在理论和实践中均表现出色，扩展了Transformer在多任务中的能力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

Motivation: GPU上大型语言模型的高效推理因内存带宽限制（尤其是HBM和SRAM之间的数据传输）而具有挑战性。现有近似注意力方法依赖昂贵的top-k操作，性能不佳。

Method: 提出SiftAttention，用基于阈值的元素过滤替代top-k操作，动态估计阈值以减少数据移动。

Result: SiftAttention在减少内存带宽使用的同时，比现有方法更好地保持了模型质量。

Conclusion: SiftAttention是一种高效且有效的近似注意力方法，适用于GPU上的大型语言模型推理。

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

Abstract: Foundation models, a cornerstone of recent advancements in machine learning,
have predominantly thrived on complete and well-structured data. Wearable
sensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a
substantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically
assume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of
Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel
SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data
without requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of
learnable mask tokens to model both existing ("inherited") and artificially
introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world
data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of
day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best
performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,
regression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits
superior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even
under targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,
such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension
prediction. This makes AIM a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data
applications.

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing
electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer
QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a
fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first
AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning
strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from
observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the
second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those
of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the
model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering
conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset
comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step
baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen
kernels.

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

Method: 提出“嫁接”方法，通过替换预训练DiTs中的操作符（如注意力机制）和配置（如MLP结构）来实现新架构设计。

Result: 实验表明，许多混合设计在仅使用不到2%的预训练计算资源下，仍能保持良好质量（FID: 2.38-2.64）。此外，嫁接方法在文本到图像模型中实现了1.43倍加速，且性能下降小于2%。

Conclusion: 嫁接方法为探索扩散模型的新设计提供了一种高效途径，支持从操作符替换到架构重构的多种编辑方式。

Abstract: Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators
(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).
However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires
costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new
software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be
studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple
approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize
new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of
activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the
DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this
testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax
attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and
replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.
Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for
DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model
(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval
score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by
converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via
grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)
than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion
model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging
from operator replacement to architecture restructuring. Code and grafted

### [153] [Inference-Time Hyper-Scaling with KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05345)
*Adrian Łańcucki,Konrad Staniszewski,Piotr Nawrot,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过压缩KV缓存实现推理时超缩放，提升推理准确率，同时保持计算预算不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer LLMs的推理成本受KV缓存大小限制，而非生成令牌数量，因此探索通过压缩KV缓存提升效率。

Method: 提出动态内存稀疏化（DMS），延迟令牌驱逐并隐式合并表示，仅需1K训练步骤即可实现8倍压缩。

Result: 在多个LLM家族中验证，DMS在相同计算预算下显著提升准确率，如Qwen-R1 32B在多个基准测试中提升7.6-9.6分。

Conclusion: DMS是一种高效的KV缓存压缩方法，支持推理时超缩放，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

TL;DR: ProLoRA实现零样本适应，无需额外训练数据即可将预训练的低秩调整（如LoRA）从源模型迁移到目标模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在切换基础模型时需要重新训练，而数据限制常使这一过程困难。ProLoRA旨在克服这一限制。

Method: 通过将源调整投影到目标模型的权重空间，利用子空间和零空间相似性，并选择性对齐层。

Result: 在文本到图像模型上的评估显示，成功实现了知识迁移且性能可比，无需重新训练。

Conclusion: ProLoRA提供了一种高效且无需数据的方法，适用于参数高效微调的场景。

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained
low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without
additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods
that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过显式推理和强化学习框架来确保自主代理在决策时保持上下文完整性的方法，显著减少了不适当的信息披露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主代理为用户做决策的时代到来，确保上下文完整性（CI）成为核心问题，即代理在特定任务中应分享哪些信息。

Method: 首先通过提示LLMs显式推理CI，然后开发强化学习框架进一步训练模型以实现CI。使用仅约700个示例的合成数据集验证方法。

Result: 方法显著减少了不适当的信息披露，同时保持任务性能，且改进可迁移到人类标注的CI基准测试（如PrivacyLens）。

Conclusion: 通过推理和强化学习框架，可以有效提升自主代理的上下文完整性，减少隐私泄露。

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Motivation: 通过结合LLMs和MARL，解决多智能体系统中的协调、通信和泛化问题，推动智能协作代理的发展。

Method: 框架包含Coordinator、Communicator和Memory三个模块，动态生成子目标、符号化通信和情景记忆，结合PPO和语言条件损失训练。

Result: 在多个游戏环境中表现优于MAPPO和QMIX，尤其在零样本泛化和协调得分上显著提升。

Conclusion: LLM-MARL为多智能体系统提供了一种新方法，展示了LLMs在智能协作代理中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI
collaboration.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在可持续制造中因幻觉工业代码和排放因子而影响决策的问题。

Method: 通过连接工业与废物实体的知识图谱，结合SPARQL查询和验证子图，实现结构化多跳推理。

Result: 在单跳和多跳问答中表现优异（ROUGE-L F1达1.0），效率提升（响应时间减半，token使用减少16%）。

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG为循环经济规划提供可靠支持，推动低碳资源决策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource
decision making.

TL;DR: HADA是一个协议和框架无关的参考架构，用于确保LLM代理和传统算法与组织目标和价值观对齐。它通过角色特定的利益相关者代理实现对话式控制，支持多场景应用，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）代理和传统算法在组织目标和价值观对齐上的挑战，提升决策的透明度、准确性和伦理合规性。

Method: HADA通过角色特定的利益相关者代理（如业务、数据科学、审计等）包装算法或LLM，提供对话式API，支持自然语言表达对齐目标和约束，并在多代理系统中持续传播和记录。

Result: 验证了HADA在六个预定义目标上的完全覆盖，包括对话控制、KPI追踪、伦理合规等，独立于底层LLM或代理库。

Conclusion: HADA为多代理系统中的人机对齐提供了开源架构和中层设计理论，实证表明其能提升决策管道的准确性、透明度和伦理合规性。

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate
ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the
underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA
architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in
multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic,
protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and
ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

Motivation: 解决LLM代理技能获取训练数据生成中的挑战，如人工成本高和任务可行性低。

Method: 采用探索代理（Alice）生成可行技能数据集，并通过反馈循环迭代训练目标代理（Bob）。

Result: 在Webshop和Crafter实验中，EXIF显著提升代理性能，并展示自进化潜力。

Conclusion: EXIF为LLM代理的自动技能发现提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用前景。

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

Motivation: 研究Transformer语言模型在推理过程中难以理解的涌现行为，试图通过统计物理方法揭示其动态机制。

Method: 使用随机动力系统建模句子级隐藏状态轨迹，结合漂移-扩散系统和潜在状态切换，捕捉推理阶段（包括失败状态）。

Result: 通过8个模型和7个基准测试，发现低维投影能解释约50%的方差，并识别出四种潜在推理模式。

Conclusion: 该框架为低成本模拟推理动态提供了工具，有助于预测关键转变（如模型失败状态）。

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

Result: 基线模型性能不超过72%（随机为50%），但专家认为大多数问题可解，显示当前模型的局限性和改进潜力。

Conclusion: 该任务对现有模型具有挑战性，但改进后可显著加速科学发现。

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

Conclusion: 这是首个应用于真正复杂工业表格数据的多表问答系统，具有显著的实际意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

Conclusion: 人本AI在公共卫生决策中具有变革潜力。

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential
of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

Result: 发现即使高性能模型在大规模市场中仍难以解决不稳定性问题，而LoRA在小市场中显著提升性能，但对大市场效果有限。

Conclusion: 需开发更复杂的策略以提升LLMs在大规模上下文输入中的推理能力。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

Result: 应用CogMath发现7种主流LLMs的数学能力被高估30%-40%，并定位了其在不同阶段/维度的优劣势。

Conclusion: CogMath为深入理解LLMs的数学能力提供了新视角，并为进一步提升其推理能力提供了具体方向。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

Motivation: 自然语言约束复杂且非正式，难以直接转化为规划算法可用的形式化描述。

Result: 实验表明，STPR能准确描述复杂数学约束，并在Gazebo模拟环境中高效运行。

Conclusion: STPR适用于多种紧凑模型，具有低推理成本和高兼容性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

Conclusion: LLMs在自动生成模式方面具有显著潜力，同时为结构化生成任务设定了新的挑战。

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like
ontology engineering, we explore automatic schema generation using LLMs. To
bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata
EntitySchema, along with evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines
effectively utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to
generate validating schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments
demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,
paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured
generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.

*Srikanth Thudumu,Jason Fisher*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenAg是一个农业人工智能框架，结合领域知识图谱和多智能体推理，提供可解释的农业决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前农业智能系统缺乏上下文理解、可解释性和适应性的问题，特别是针对资源有限的小农户。

Method: 结合领域基础模型、神经知识图谱、多智能体推理、因果解释和自适应迁移学习。

Result: OpenAg提供情境感知、可解释且可操作的农业决策支持。

Conclusion: OpenAg旨在弥合科学知识与农民经验之间的差距，支持本地化农业决策。

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

TL;DR: DeePoly框架通过结合深度神经网络（DNN）和多项式基函数，解决了传统DNN方法在求解偏微分方程（PDE）时缺乏收敛保证和计算效率的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNN方法在科学计算中缺乏收敛保证和效率，需要一种既能捕捉全局复杂特征又能提供高精度局部修正的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：先用DNN捕捉全局特征，再用线性空间优化结合DNN提取的特征和多项式基函数。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，该方法显著提高了高阶精度和效率，同时保持无网格和无方案特性。

Conclusion: DeePoly框架成功结合了DNN和多项式基的优势，为PDE求解提供了高效且理论可靠的新方法。

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

Motivation: GUI自动化在交互环境中需要实时决策，错误容忍度低。现有方法缺乏有效的预操作反馈机制，可能导致不可逆后果。

Method: 提出S-GRPO策略构建GUI-Critic-R1模型，引入建议奖励提升反馈可靠性；开发基于推理引导的数据收集管道生成训练和测试数据集。

Conclusion: GUI-Critic-R1通过预操作批评机制有效提升了GUI自动化的可靠性和效率，填补了相关数据空白。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个专注于法律推理任务的基准测试CHANCERY，用于评估模型在判断公司治理行为是否符合章程方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律数据集未专门针对推理任务，而法律实践中的推理能力至关重要。

Method: 基于真实公司治理法律，构建包含章程和提案的二元分类任务，并评估SOTA模型的性能。

Result: SOTA模型（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet和GPT-4o）准确率较低（64.5%和75.2%），推理代理表现更优（76.1%和78.1%）。

Conclusion: CHANCERY揭示了当前模型在法律推理上的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

Motivation: 探究LLM代理能否在挑战性环境中自我改进战略规划能力。

Method: 使用《卡坦岛》游戏和Catanatron框架，设计多角色协作架构（分析者、研究者、编码者、玩家），比较手动与LLM自主演化的代理。

Result: 自主演化的代理（如Claude 3.7和GPT-4o驱动）在战略适应性和性能上优于静态基线。

Conclusion: LLM代理能通过自主改进在多轮迭代中显著提升战略能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的框架，用于从非结构化的电动自行车事故报告中提取和分析安全变量，以量化事故严重性与多种因素的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动自行车（e-bike）事故报告多为非结构化文本，难以进行定量安全分析，因此需要一种高效的方法来提取关键信息。

Method: 研究设计了四个LLM代理，分别处理数据分类、信息提取、伤害原因确定和组件关联，并结合有序logit模型分析事故严重性与提取因素的关系。

Result: 研究发现设备问题比人为问题更常见，但人为问题更致命；模型分类准确率加权F1得分为0.87。

Conclusion: 该方法为电动自行车安全分析提供了可扩展的解决方案，并为政策制定者和设计者提供了实用信息。

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety
concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large
language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables
from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,
handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause
determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could
lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to
accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in
classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract
unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a
scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable
information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

Result: 实验表明，LLM驱动的代理能够促进游戏中角色专业化和价格波动等符合市场规则的涌现现象。

Conclusion: LLM为MMO经济模拟提供了一种有效的新方法，能够更真实地模拟人类经济行为。

Abstract: Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research,
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game
economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced
by reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, existing works encounter significant
challenges when attempting to emulate human-like economic activities among
agents, particularly regarding agent reliability, sociability, and
interpretability. In this study, we take a preliminary step in introducing a
novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in MMO economy simulation.
Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning
aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and
adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing,
perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges
effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities
demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role
specialization and price fluctuations in line with market rules.

Motivation: 尽管基于RL的训练方法（如GRPO）在实证中表现出显著优势，但其具体优势仍缺乏深入理解。

Method: 引入细粒度分析框架，研究RL对推理能力的影响，包括计划执行、问题分解和知识利用等关键因素。

Result: RL调优的模型在计划执行中表现更稳健，且能更好地整合知识，但在外部计划指导下性能下降。

Conclusion: RL可能主要通过帮助模型制定内部策略而非执行外部计划来提升推理能力，为推理模型的训练和评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在安全性和性能上均显著优于非自适应方法，适用于多种安全关键任务。

Conclusion: 该框架在安全性和性能上实现了同步优化，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

Result: 在Gymnasium和MuJoCo任务中成功找到最优或高性能解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法有效整合符号推理与感知运动数据，为具身智能体控制提供新思路。

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

Conclusion: 揭示了推理模型的诚实性问题，为可信AI对齐提供了工具和方法。

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Conclusion: DiffLogic CA为可编程物质与鲁棒计算系统提供新方向，首次在循环架构中成功应用可微分逻辑门网络。

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful
application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

Motivation: 传统奖励驱动的自主系统无法适应资源波动的环境，因此需要一种以生存为核心的新型自主系统。

Method: 提出能量效用函数和生存约束框架，结合能量采集、热调节和自适应计算的模块化架构。

Result: 模拟环境中实现了无需外部监督的稳定资源感知行为。

Conclusion: 为资源波动环境中的自主系统提供了理论和架构基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

TL;DR: RAG-UAV框架通过检索增强生成技术，提升LLMs在无人机数学推理任务中的表现，显著提高准确率并减少错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无人机控制依赖硬编码方程，而LLMs虽灵活但数学推理不可靠，需改进。

Method: 提出RAG-UAV框架，结合检索与生成，评估使用UAV-Math-Bench数据集。

Result: 检索显著提升准确率（最高75%），减少错误选择（25%降至5%），降低数值误差。

Conclusion: RAG可增强LLMs在工程分析中的可靠性，但实时飞行控制需进一步验证。

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question
and answer are publicly available.

Motivation: 现有自改进智能体的方法存在局限性，如过程僵化、难以跨任务领域泛化，且无法随能力提升而扩展。作者认为有效的自改进需要内在元认知学习。

Method: 提出了一个包含元认知知识、元认知规划和元认知评估的正式框架，并分析了现有智能体依赖外在元认知机制的问题。

Result: 发现许多内在元认知的要素已存在于现有方法中，并探讨了如何优化人类与智能体在元认知中的分工。

Conclusion: 为实现持续、通用且对齐的自改进，需解决内在元认知学习的评估与改进等关键挑战。

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

TL;DR: LLM-First Search (LFS) 是一种新型的LLM自引导搜索方法，通过让LLM自主控制搜索过程，无需预定义策略，提高了灵活性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有搜索方法（如MCTS）依赖固定探索参数，难以适应不同难度任务，限制了其实际应用。

Method: LFS利用LLM的内部评分机制自主决定搜索路径，无需外部启发式或硬编码策略。

Result: LFS在Countdown和Sudoku任务中表现优于ToT-BFS、BestFS和MCTS，计算效率更高，且能随模型和计算预算提升而扩展。

Conclusion: LFS是一种高效、灵活的搜索方法，适用于复杂推理任务，无需手动调整。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法在推理时生成过多令牌，浪费计算资源，且难以针对不同难度问题灵活调整。

Method: ALP通过监控每个提示的在线解决率，动态调整惩罚强度，使简单问题生成更少令牌，困难问题不受限。

Result: ALP将DeepScaleR-1.5B的平均令牌使用量减少50%，同时保持性能，并在困难问题上表现更好。

Conclusion: ALP能智能分配计算资源，提高效率，尤其适用于难度不均的任务。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

Motivation: 尽管YouTube广泛使用且研究众多，但其数据API（尤其是搜索端点）的运作方式仍不明确，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过12周内运行相同查询，分析API的行为和结果一致性。

Result: API返回结果高度不一致，可能随机化结果并优先显示更短、更受欢迎的视频，但频道流行度的影响不明确。

Conclusion: 建议研究者在使用API时采取策略应对结果不一致性，并探索API的更多用例。

Abstract: YouTube is among the most widely-used platforms worldwide, and has seen a lot
of recent academic attention. Despite its popularity and the number of studies
conducted on it, much less is understood about the way in which YouTube's Data
API, and especially the Search endpoint, operates. In this paper, we analyze
the API's behavior by running identical queries across a period of 12 weeks.
Our findings suggest that the search endpoint returns highly inconsistent
results between queries in ways that are not officially documented.
Specifically, the API seems to randomize returned videos based on the relative
popularity of the respective topic during the query period, making it nearly
impossible to obtain representative historical video samples, especially during
non-peak topical periods. Our results also suggest that the API may prioritize
shorter, more popular videos, although the role of channel popularity is not as
clear. We conclude with suggested strategies for researchers using the API for
data collection, as well as future research directions on expanding the API's
use-cases.

Result: 实验表明PUB生成的数据与真实用户行为高度一致，并揭示了人格特质与推荐结果的关联。

Conclusion: PUB为推荐系统评估提供了可扩展、可控且高保真的替代方案。

Abstract: Traditional offline evaluation methods for recommender systems struggle to
capture the complexity of modern platforms due to sparse behavioural signals,
noisy data, and limited modelling of user personality traits. While simulation
frameworks can generate synthetic data to address these gaps, existing methods
fail to replicate behavioural diversity, limiting their effectiveness. To
overcome these challenges, we propose the Personality-driven User Behaviour
Simulator (PUB), an LLM-based simulation framework that integrates the Big Five
personality traits to model personalised user behaviour. PUB dynamically infers
user personality from behavioural logs (e.g., ratings, reviews) and item
metadata, then generates synthetic interactions that preserve statistical
fidelity to real-world data. Experiments on the Amazon review datasets show
that logs generated by PUB closely align with real user behaviour and reveal
meaningful associations between personality traits and recommendation outcomes.
These results highlight the potential of the personality-driven simulator to
advance recommender system evaluation, offering scalable, controllable,
high-fidelity alternatives to resource-intensive real-world experiments.

Result: 在多个数据集上，Exp4Fuse超越现有LLM查询扩展方法，结合先进稀疏检索器实现SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse显著提升了稀疏检索中的查询扩展效果，具有高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在查询扩展中表现优异，但成本高且计算密集，限制了其可访问性。

Method: GOLFer包含两个模块：幻觉过滤器（检测并移除非事实和不一致的句子）和文档组合器（通过权重向量平衡查询与生成内容）。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，GOLFer优于其他小型模型方法，并与大型LLM方法竞争。

Conclusion: GOLFer为小型语言模型提供了一种高效且经济的查询扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Motivation: ColPali/ColQwen2在VDR中性能强，但每页生成多个嵌入导致内存占用过高，需研究减少嵌入数量的方法。

Method: 评估了两种策略：剪枝和合并。剪枝中随机策略表现最佳但不理想；合并策略通过优化组合，开发了Light-ColPali/ColQwen2。

Result: Light-ColPali/ColQwen2保持98.2%检索性能，内存占用仅为11.8%；在2.8%内存下保持94.6%效果。

Conclusion: 研究为高效VDR提供了有价值的见解和竞争基线，Light-ColPali/ColQwen2是未来研究的参考。

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

Motivation: 现有基于对比学习的方法在会话推荐中存在三个问题：忽略项目级稀疏性、增强会话时语义不一致性、以及未区分正负信号的不同贡献。

Method: 提出MACL框架，利用多模态特征生成语义一致的增强视图，并设计自适应对比损失以区分正负信号的贡献。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，MACL优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MACL通过多模态增强和自适应对比学习，有效解决了会话推荐中的数据稀疏性和语义一致性问题。

Abstract: Session-based recommendation aims to predict intents of anonymous users based
on limited behaviors. With the ability in alleviating data sparsity,
contrastive learning is prevailing in the task. However, we spot that existing
contrastive learning based methods still suffer from three obstacles: (1) they
overlook item-level sparsity and primarily focus on session-level sparsity; (2)
they typically augment sessions using item IDs like crop, mask and reorder,
failing to ensure the semantic consistency of augmented views; (3) they treat
all positive-negative signals equally, without considering their varying
utility. To this end, we propose a novel multi-modal adaptive contrastive
learning framework called MACL for session-based recommendation. In MACL, a
multi-modal augmentation is devised to generate semantically consistent views
at both item and session levels by leveraging item multi-modal features.
Besides, we present an adaptive contrastive loss that distinguishes varying
contributions of positive-negative signals to improve self-supervised learning.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority
of MACL over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: R2Rec通过显式推理链提升推荐性能和可解释性，为LLM在推荐任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into
recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic
understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions
or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning,
boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields
like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are
clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly
applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user
feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we
propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that
samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into
structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy,
with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction
context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on
implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement
learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit
supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms
classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement
in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore,
the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the
decision process. Our code is available at:

Abstract: The proliferation of complex structured data in hybrid sources, such as PDF
documents and web pages, presents unique challenges for current Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in providing
accurate answers. Despite the recent advancements of MLLMs, they still often

outputs. This paper explores the capabilities of LLMs and MLLMs in
understanding and answering questions from complex data structures found in PDF
documents by leveraging industrial and open-source tools as part of a
pre-processing pipeline. Our findings indicate that GPT-4o, a popular MLLM,
achieves an accuracy of 56% on multi-structured documents when fed documents
directly, and that integrating pre-processing tools raises the accuracy of LLMs
to 61.3% for GPT-4o and 76% for GPT-4, and with lower overall cost. The code is

Result: 结构条件逆向折叠模型在亲和力相关性和生成任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: AbBiBench提供了一个统一的、基于生物学的评估框架，促进更有效的抗体设计模型发展。

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

### [199] [The Latent Space Hypothesis: Toward Universal Medical Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04515)
*Salil Patel*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于潜在空间假设的医学数据统一表示方法，将多模态数据映射到一个共享的几何空间中，用于个性化诊断和治疗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据多模态且复杂，传统方法难以统一处理。潜在空间假设提供了一种将异构数据映射到统一空间的方法，以揭示疾病轨迹和个性化治疗方向。

Method: 通过潜在空间假设，将医学数据（如基因组、影像、临床记录）映射到一个共享的几何空间中，利用编码器和学习算法表示健康状态、疾病轨迹和治疗向量。

Result: 该方法能够揭示疾病亚轨迹和患者特异性变化方向，为个性化诊断和治疗提供量化依据。

Conclusion: 潜在空间假设为医学数据分析和临床实践提供了新思路，但仍需解决数据偏见、稀缺性和隐私等问题。

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

*Botao Amber Hu,Helena Rong*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于开放系统的ALife研究，通过Spore.fun实验验证了区块链和LLM驱动的AI代理能否实现持续开放演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统封闭系统模拟（如Tierra和Avida）难以实现持续开放演化（OEE），学者认为需要开放系统与环境持续交互。

Method: 利用DePIN技术和区块链上的LLM代理（如Spore.fun实验），研究其自主演化和行为轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，开放系统下的AI代理可能通过经济激励和环境交互实现OEE。

Conclusion: 开放ALife系统（如Spore.fun）为OEE的实现提供了新思路，但仍需进一步讨论和验证。

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享全局优势在多智能体强化学习中可能导致次优策略更新，因为未能区分各智能体的贡献。现有方法缺乏对联盟层面的详细分析。

Method: 提出CORA方法，通过评估所有可能联盟的边际贡献，利用合作博弈论的核心解分解优势，确保联盟理性，并采用随机联盟采样降低计算开销。

Result: 在矩阵游戏、微分游戏和多智能体协作基准测试中，CORA表现优于基线方法，尤其是在存在多个局部最优的任务中。

Conclusion: 联盟感知的信用分配对提升多智能体强化学习性能至关重要，CORA方法为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种异构多智能体在线自主协同调度算法HoAs-PALN，用于高效收集灾后环境信息。通过自适应降维和局部纳什均衡博弈，该算法显著提升了调度效率和任务完成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然灾害对人类社会造成重大损失，灾后环境信息的及时高效获取对救援行动至关重要。现有传感技术因环境复杂性面临适应性弱、专用能力不足等问题。

Method: HoAs-PALN通过自适应降维将五维匹配过程转化为两类三维匹配过程，并结合局部纳什均衡博弈优化行为选择概率。

Result: 实验表明，HoAs-PALN相比基线方法（GREEDY、K-WTA、MADL和MARL）任务完成率平均提升64.12%、46.48%、16.55%和14.03%，且每次调度决策时间少于10秒。

Conclusion: HoAs-PALN在动态灾后环境中表现出高效性和实用性，为灾后信息收集提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种异步LLM代理，能够决定何时发言，并在在线Mafia游戏中表现与人类玩家相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的许多场景（如群聊、在线会议）是异步的，而现有LLM主要用于同步通信，因此需要开发能适应异步环境的代理。

Method: 开发了一种自适应异步LLM代理，能够决定发言时机，并通过在线Mafia游戏数据集进行测试。

Result: 代理在游戏表现和融入人类玩家方面与人类相当，发言时机行为接近人类，但内容存在差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM在真实人类群体环境中的应用铺平了道路，支持进一步研究异步通信。

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 论文建立了一个连接光学物理方程与生成模型的数学框架，展示了光传播动力学如何启发强大的人工智能方法。非线性光学模型通过自组织原理表现出卓越能力，显著优于线性模型和传统生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索光学物理方程与生成模型之间的联系，利用光传播动力学的自组织特性提升人工智能方法的效率和性能。

Method: 分析了六个基本光学方程，比较了线性模型（如Helmholtz、耗散波和Eikonal方程）及其非线性扩展（如Kerr效应、立方-五次非线性和强度依赖折射率）。通过实验验证非线性模型的优越性。

Result: 非线性模型在参数减少、模式分离、稳定性和生成质量方面显著优于线性模型。例如，非线性Helmholtz模型的FID分数为0.0089，而线性版本为1.0909。内存使用减少40-60%，训练时间提升30-50%。

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了物理自组织与人工智能之间的深层联系，为高效光学计算实现提供了新途径，同时推动了生成AI和光学物理的双向发展。

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework connecting
optical physics equations to generative models, demonstrating how light
propagation dynamics inspire powerful artificial intelligence approaches. We
analyze six fundamental optical equations, comparing linear models (Helmholtz,
dissipative wave, and Eikonal equations) with their nonlinear extensions
incorporating Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and
intensity-dependent refractive indices. Our nonlinear optical models reveal
remarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The
nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining
superior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic
dissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced
attractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with
20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates
adaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced
controllability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates
consistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative
approaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus
1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID
with exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time
improves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework
enables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical
physics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and
refractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy. This work reveals deep
connections between physical self-organization and artificial intelligence,
opening pathways toward efficient optical computing implementations.

TL;DR: BEAR框架利用大型语言模型自动生成BGP异常事件的详细报告，提升了解释性和分析精度，并在真实和合成数据上实现了100%的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BGP异常（如路由泄漏和劫持）威胁网络可靠性和安全性，现有方法依赖专家知识解释事件。

Method: BEAR通过多步推理将表格数据转化为文本叙述，并利用LLM生成合成数据以弥补公开数据不足。

Result: BEAR在真实和合成数据集上表现优异，准确率达100%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: BEAR为BGP异常事件的自动化解释提供了创新解决方案，为网络管理提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real
and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,
outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work
pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering
valuable operational insights for network management.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态信道分配算法（BAI-MCTS和LLM-BAI-MCTS），用于解决WiFi 7网络中多链路操作（MLO）在密集环境中的信道分配问题，显著提升了收敛速度和性能。


<details>

Motivation: WiFi 7的MLO功能在密集网络环境中面临信道分配挑战，现有研究多关注静态网络配置，本文旨在解决动态信道分配问题。

Method: 将问题建模为组合优化问题，采用MAB框架进行在线学习，提出BAI-MCTS算法，并进一步结合LLM提出LLM-BAI-MCTS算法。

Result: BAI-MCTS算法在达到最优值的98%时收敛速度比现有算法快50.44%，LLM-BAI-MCTS在密集网络中收敛速度提升63.32%。

Conclusion: 提出的算法显著提升了WiFi 7网络中动态信道分配的效率和性能，尤其在密集网络中表现突出。

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains
underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT)
players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization
of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges
as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new
service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating
operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function
(NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected
across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use
cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of
methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting
broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70
articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and
explore its potential for monetization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经ODE的数据驱动框架，用于从PDE系统中学习降阶矩动力学，适用于稀疏和不规则时间序列数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于导数的方法（如SINDy）需要密集采样数据且对噪声敏感，而神经ODE能够直接建模矩轨迹，提高鲁棒性。

Method: 使用神经ODE直接建模矩轨迹，并通过Stiefel流形优化实现数据驱动的坐标变换，以发现低维表示。

Result: 在非线性薛定谔方程和Fisher-KPP反应-扩散系统中，该方法能准确恢复或近似矩动力学，且具有更好的外推精度。

Conclusion: 神经ODE框架是一种强大且灵活的工具，适用于学习复杂PDE系统中的低维矩动力学。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics
from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based
methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to
noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories,
enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series.
Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the
framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is
available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without
analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation
strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of
low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,
facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a
closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system.
Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the
unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared
to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under
sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in
data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a
powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment
dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.

The goal is to identify geodesic curves in the space of probability measures

address the case of a collection of Gaussian distributions, and show how to
lift the computations in the space of invertible linear maps. For the more
general setting of absolutely continuous probability measures, we leverage a
novel approach to parameterizing geodesics in Wasserstein space with neural
networks. Finally, we compare to classical tangent PCA through various examples
and provide illustrations on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 新算法在成本和性能上优于现有方法，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Motivated by real-world settings where data collection and policy deployment
-- whether for a single agent or across multiple agents -- are costly, we study
the problem of on-policy single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and federated
RL (FRL) with a focus on minimizing burn-in costs (the sample sizes needed to
reach near-optimal regret) and policy switching or communication costs. In
parallel finite-horizon episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$
states and $A$ actions, existing methods either require superlinear burn-in
costs in $S$ and $A$ or fail to achieve logarithmic switching or communication
costs. We propose two novel model-free RL algorithms -- Q-EarlySettled-LowCost
and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost -- that are the first in the literature to
simultaneously achieve: (i) the best near-optimal regret among all known
model-free RL or FRL algorithms, (ii) low burn-in cost that scales linearly
with $S$ and $A$, and (iii) logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent
RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, we establish gap-dependent
theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs,
improving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法在合成和真实数据集上具有领先的预测性能。

Conclusion: 分布编码（DE）是一种高效且互补的方法，适用于离散和混合空间的贝叶斯优化。

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a popular and sample-efficient approach
for many engineering applications, where observations are expensive to acquire,
and is also a central ingredient of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly
prevailing method for the optimization of black-box functions. However, when
all or some input variables are categorical, building a predictive and
computationally efficient GP remains challenging. Starting from the naive
target encoding idea, where the original categorical values are replaced with
the mean of the target variable for that category, we propose a generalization
based on distributional encoding (DE) which makes use of all samples of the
target variable for a category. To handle this type of encoding inside the GP,
we build upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability
distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein
distance. We also discuss several extensions for classification, multi-task
learning and incorporation or auxiliary information. Our approach is validated
empirically, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance on a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. DE is naturally complementary to
recent advances in BO over discrete and mixed-spaces.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects of joint interventions on multiple variables is
crucial in many domains, but obtaining data from such simultaneous
interventions can be challenging. Our study explores how to learn joint
interventional effects using only observational data and single-variable
interventions. We present an identifiability result for this problem, showing
that for a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms, joint effects can be
inferred without access to joint interventional data. We propose a practical
estimator that decomposes the causal effect into confounded and unconfounded
contributions for each intervention variable. Experiments on synthetic data
demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to models trained
directly on joint interventional data, outperforming a purely observational
estimator.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对随机向量的非线性加性噪声模型，用于推断变量组之间的因果关系，并通过模拟和实际数据验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多领域（如神经科学、心理学、社会科学和工业制造）中，因果关系的单位是变量组而非单个标量变量，现有方法对此支持不足。

Method: 采用两步法：首先推断随机向量间的因果顺序，然后进行模型选择以确定最佳因果图。

Result: 在模拟中表现优异，并成功应用于实际工业数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为变量组间的因果推断提供了有效工具，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data has gained
significant attention in recent years, but most methods are limited to scalar
random variables. In many important domains, including neuroscience,
psychology, social science, and industrial manufacturing, the causal units of
interest are groups of variables rather than individual scalar measurements.
Motivated by these applications, we extend nonlinear additive noise models to
handle random vectors, establishing a two-step approach for causal graph
learning: First, infer the causal order among random vectors. Second, perform
model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. We
introduce effective and novel solutions for both steps in the vector case,
demonstrating strong performance in simulations. Finally, we apply our method
to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering
among variable groups.

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法在准确性和鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文在理论和实践上推进了线性系统中潜在混杂变量下因果推断的理解。

Abstract: This paper investigates causal effect identification in latent variable
Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models (lvLiNGAM) using higher-order cumulants,
addressing two prominent setups that are challenging in the presence of latent
confounding: (1) a single proxy variable that may causally influence the
treatment and (2) underspecified instrumental variable cases where fewer
instruments exist than treatments. We prove that causal effects are
identifiable with a single proxy or instrument and provide corresponding
estimation methods. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and
robustness of our approaches compared to existing methods, advancing the
theoretical and practical understanding of causal inference in linear systems
with latent confounders.

TL;DR: 在最佳臂识别问题中，当实验者可以选择适应性试验时，忽略此选项而选择非适应性试验是不可取的。研究发现，至少有三个处理臂时，简单的适应性设计普遍且严格优于完全随机化的非适应性试验。

Motivation: 探讨在最佳臂识别问题中，适应性试验是否比非适应性试验更具优势。

Method: 研究采用批处理臂淘汰设计，逐步淘汰表现不佳的处理臂，并通过效率指数量化设计在大样本下的统计效率。

Result: 当至少有三个处理臂时，适应性设计普遍且严格优于完全随机化的非适应性试验。

Conclusion: 适应性设计在最佳臂识别问题中具有显著优势，解决了Qin [2022]中的第二个开放问题。

Abstract: When an experimenter has the option of running an adaptive trial, is it
admissible to ignore this option and run a non-adaptive trial instead? We
provide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification
problem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts
judiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find
that, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple
adaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely
randomized trials. This dominance is characterized by a notion called
efficiency exponent, which quantifies a design's statistical efficiency when
the experimental sample is large. Our analysis focuses on the class of batched
arm elimination designs, which progressively eliminate underperforming arms at
pre-specified batch intervals. We characterize simple sufficient conditions
under which these designs universally and strictly dominate completely
randomized trials. These results resolve the second open problem posed in Qin
[2022].

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为kTULA的新算法，用于解决深度学习中的采样问题，并提供了理论性能保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习应用中，全局Lipschitz连续性条件常不满足，需处理对数梯度超线性增长的分布采样问题。

Method: 提出基于tamed Langevin dynamics的kTULA算法，并分析其收敛性。

Result: 在KL散度中获得了最佳收敛率2−ε‾（ε‾>0），并改进了Wasserstein-2距离的非渐近误差界。

Conclusion: kTULA在采样高维双势阱分布和神经网络优化问题中表现良好，理论结果为其性能提供了保证。

Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz
continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling
from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a
novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the
aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its
performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal
to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}>0$, which significantly
improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an
improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be
used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the
associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we
apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional
double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a
neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide
theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在负责任AI的背景下，验证复制系统是否保持可信赖性是一个重要但未被充分研究的问题。

Method: 引入了一种演算来建模和验证数据和概率复杂查询，定义了四种可信赖性概念，并通过分析复制系统与原始系统的行为来检查这些概念。

Result: 研究了这些可信赖性概念之间的关系及其在逻辑操作下的组合方式。

Conclusion: 该研究为验证复杂复制系统的可信赖性提供了计算工具。

Abstract: A common practice of ML systems development concerns the training of the same
model under different data sets, and the use of the same (training and test)
sets for different learning models. The first case is a desirable practice for
identifying high quality and unbiased training conditions. The latter case
coincides with the search for optimal models under a common dataset for
training. These differently obtained systems have been considered akin to
copies. In the quest for responsible AI, a legitimate but hardly investigated
question is how to verify that trustworthiness is preserved by copies. In this
paper we introduce a calculus to model and verify probabilistic complex queries
over data and define four distinct notions: Justifiably, Equally, Weakly and
Almost Trustworthy which can be checked analysing the (partial) behaviour of
the copy with respect to its original. We provide a study of the relations
between these notions of trustworthiness, and how they compose with each other
and under logical operations. The aim is to offer a computational tool to check
the trustworthiness of possibly complex systems copied from an original whose
behavour is known.

TL;DR: CoRe-MMRAG是一种新型端到端框架，通过四阶段流程解决多模态检索增强生成中的知识不一致问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态检索增强生成（MMRAG）中存在的参数化与检索知识不一致（PRKI）及视觉与文本知识不一致（VTKI）问题，影响了模型的可靠性。

Method: 提出CoRe-MMRAG框架，包括生成内部响应、联合相似性评估选择多模态证据、生成外部响应及整合两响应四个阶段，并通过专门训练范式增强知识源区分与整合能力。

Result: 在KB-VQA基准测试中，CoRe-MMRAG在InfoSeek和Encyclopedic-VQA上分别实现了5.6%和9.3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: CoRe-MMRAG有效解决了多模态知识不一致问题，显著提升了多模态检索增强生成的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) has been introduced to
enhance Multimodal Large Language Models by incorporating externally retrieved
multimodal knowledge, but it introduces two challenges: Parametric-Retrieved
Knowledge Inconsistency (PRKI), where discrepancies between parametric and
retrieved knowledge create uncertainty in determining reliability, and
Visual-Textual Knowledge Inconsistency (VTKI), where misalignment between
visual and textual sources disrupts entity representation. To address these
challenges, we propose Cross-source knowledge \textbf{Re}conciliation for
Multimodal RAG (CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively
reconciles inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a
four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric
knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint
similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates
both to produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training
paradigm enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and
unified answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that
CoRe-MMRAG achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving
5.6% and 9.3% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Verbose ListOps是一个新基准，通过将ListOps计算转化为长故事，测试LLMs在嵌套叙事推理中的表现，揭示了其在状态管理上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能有效测试LLMs在嵌套叙事推理中的能力，掩盖了其核心限制。Verbose ListOps旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过程序化生成长故事形式的ListOps问题，迫使LLMs进行内部计算和状态管理，同时控制叙事长度和推理难度。

Result: 实验表明，主流LLMs在Verbose ListOps上表现不佳，尤其是在中等长度叙事中，尽管能轻松解决原始ListOps问题。

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps揭示了LLMs在嵌套推理中的关键弱点，为未来改进提供了方向，尤其是在知识自动化领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统过于依赖检索上下文，可能导致依赖不准确来源或忽视模型固有知识，尤其是在处理误导性或过量信息时。

Method: 提出Knowledgeable-r1，采用联合采样和多策略分布探索知识能力，以激发大语言模型对参数化知识和上下文知识的自我整合利用。

Result: 实验表明，Knowledgeable-r1在参数与上下文冲突任务及一般RAG任务中显著提升鲁棒性和推理准确性，尤其在反事实场景中优于基线17.07%。

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1有效解决了RAG系统的不平衡问题，展示了在多种任务中的一致性能提升。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

TL;DR: ECoRAG框架通过基于证据性的检索文档压缩，提升LLM在开放域问答任务中的性能，同时降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩方法未过滤非证据性信息，限制了LLM在RAG中的表现。

Result: ECoRAG在ODQA任务中优于现有压缩方法，且成本更低。

Conclusion: ECoRAG通过优化证据性压缩和检索，显著提升了LLM的性能和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Method: 通过众包收集24,000对多轮对话数据，包含12,000个人类偏好投票，分析用户偏好和系统表现。

Result: 用户偏好受引用数量和来源影响；搜索增强模型在非搜索场景表现良好，但纯参数知识在搜索场景表现较差。

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

Result: 测试了20多个主流MLLMs，发现即使是先进模型也面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: HSSBench有望推动MLLMs在跨学科推理能力上的进一步研究。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

Result: 研究发现句子嵌入中许多语义和句法特征是线性编码的。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了从词级到句子级的可解释性，提供了更透明和可控的表示。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

Result: 预训练和指令调优中对马耳他语的接触是关键因素；微调虽成本高但性能更好。

Conclusion: 建议低资源语言研究采用更传统的语言建模方法，并关注微调与提示的权衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [228] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了人类规模预训练语言模型对罕见英语LET-ALONE结构的语法形式和意义的泛化能力，发现模型能感知形式但无法正确理解意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能像人类一样从常见结构中泛化到罕见结构，并理解其形式和意义。

Method: 构建针对LET-ALONE结构的合成基准测试，评估模型对其语法形式和语义的理解。

Result: 模型能感知LET-ALONE的形式，但无法正确泛化其意义。

Conclusion: 当前架构在语言形式和意义的样本效率上存在不对称性，与人类学习者不同。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）区分英语中“just”的细微语义差异的能力，发现模型在捕捉更微妙差异方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能理解多功能的语篇助词（如“just”）的细微语义差异。

Method: 使用专家标注的数据集，测试LLMs对“just”不同语义类别的区分能力。

Result: LLMs能区分较宽泛的语义类别，但对更细微的差异理解有限。

Conclusion: LLMs在理解语篇助词的细微语义方面仍有局限，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SSA-MTE数据集和SSA-COMET评估指标，用于改进非洲低资源语言的机器翻译质量评估，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译质量评估指标在非洲低资源语言中表现不佳，缺乏针对性的数据集和评估方法。

Method: 构建了包含13种非洲语言对的大规模人工标注数据集SSA-MTE，并基于此开发了SSA-COMET和SSA-COMET-QE评估指标。

Result: SSA-COMET在低资源语言（如Twi、Luo和Yoruba）上显著优于AfriCOMET，并与最强LLM（Gemini 2.5 Pro）竞争。

Conclusion: SSA-MTE和SSA-COMET为非洲低资源语言的机器翻译评估提供了有效工具，所有资源已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在零样本金融情感分析中的表现，发现推理能力并未提升任务表现，且直觉式（System 1）模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在金融情感分析中的表现，探索推理能力是否有助于任务表现。

Method: 使用Financial PhraseBank数据集，比较不同LLMs和提示策略（System 1与System 2）的表现，并与微调模型（FinBERT）对比。

Result: GPT-4o在无推理提示时表现最佳，推理可能因过度思考导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 金融情感分析中，直觉式思维更接近人类判断，推理能力并非总是提升模型表现。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性声明设计用于挑战事实核查系统，现有基于检索增强语言模型的系统难以应对。

Method: SUCEA框架分为三步：声明分割与去上下文化、迭代证据检索与声明编辑、证据聚合与标签预测。

Result: 在两个挑战性数据集上，SUCEA显著提升了检索和标签预测准确性，优于四种基线方法。

Conclusion: SUCEA通过模块化框架有效应对对抗性声明，提升了事实核查系统的性能。

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为$Safe$的回顾性、步骤感知的形式验证框架，利用Lean 4形式化数学语言验证LLM生成的推理步骤，以减少幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Chain-of-Thought (CoT)提示方法存在幻觉问题，且现有检测方法（如PRMs或自一致性）缺乏可验证证据。

Method: 提出$Safe$框架，通过Lean 4形式化语言为每一步推理提供数学证明，确保可验证性。

Result: 在多个语言模型和数学数据集上验证，性能显著提升，并提供了可解释的证据。同时提出$FormalStep$基准（30,809条形式化语句）。

Conclusion: 首次将Lean 4用于验证LLM生成内容，为幻觉问题提供了可验证的解决方案，符合形式化数学语言的初衷。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化句子语义表示的静态词嵌入方法，通过改进预训练的句子Transformer的词嵌入，结合句子级主成分分析和知识蒸馏或对比学习，实现了高效且性能优越的句子表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态词嵌入在句子语义任务中表现不足，需要一种更高效且性能优越的方法。

Method: 从预训练的句子Transformer中提取词嵌入，通过句子级主成分分析改进，再结合知识蒸馏或对比学习。推理时通过简单平均词嵌入表示句子。

Result: 在单语和跨语言任务中显著优于现有静态模型，部分数据集上甚至媲美基础句子Transformer模型（SimCSE）。

Conclusion: 该方法成功去除了与句子语义无关的词嵌入成分，并根据单词对句子语义的影响调整向量范数。

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding
refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective
reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

Motivation: 虚假新闻在社交媒体上的传播对社会造成严重影响，现有方法（如SLMs和LLMs）因数据稀缺、知识过时等问题难以有效应对。

Method: 提出C²EFND框架，结合LLMs的泛化能力和SLMs的分类专长，采用多轮协作学习、终身知识编辑模块和基于回放的持续学习方法。

Result: 在Pheme和Twitter16数据集上的实验表明，C²EFND显著优于现有方法，提升了检测准确性和适应性。

Conclusion: C²EFND框架通过协作学习和持续更新，有效解决了虚假新闻检测中的挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

TL;DR: 该研究通过多维度政治学习框架和可解释表示工程技术，探索LLMs内部政治意图，解决了单轴分析的概念混淆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的开放回答与其内部意图存在偏差，且现有分析多依赖单轴概念，易导致混淆。

Method: 设计四维政治学习框架，构建数据集，应用三种表示工程技术，对八个开源LLMs进行实验。

Result: 向量能解构政治概念混淆，检测任务验证其语义意义，干预实验可生成不同政治倾向的回答。

Conclusion: 多维度框架和表示工程技术能更透明地学习LLMs政治概念，并有效干预其内部机制。

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的快速发展需要系统理解不同模态如何与语言主干连接，填补现有文献的空白。

Method: 通过分析125个MLLMs，提出基于三个维度的分类框架：架构策略（模态集成机制与融合级别）、表示学习技术（联合或协调表示）和训练范式（训练策略与目标函数）。

Result: 总结出MLLMs领域的发展趋势，并为研究人员提供了当前集成技术的结构化概述。

Conclusion: 该分类框架旨在指导未来基于预训练基础的更鲁棒多模态集成策略的开发。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

Motivation: 现有基准测试仅依赖最终答案准确性，无法全面评估推理过程的质量和结构，因此需要更精细的评估方法。

Method: 提出FineLogic框架，从三个维度评估逻辑推理，并研究四种监督格式对模型推理能力的影响。

Result: 自然语言监督在泛化任务中表现更好，符号监督则生成更结构化的推理链。微调主要通过逐步生成改进推理行为。

Conclusion: FineLogic为评估和改进大语言模型的逻辑推理提供了更严谨和可解释的工具。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

Motivation: 加密填字游戏线索是复杂的语言任务，现有系统难以高效解决。本文旨在开发一种可解释的、基于LLM的系统，以提升解决此类问题的能力。

Method: 系统采用三步法：(i)假设答案；(ii)提出词义解释；(iii)通过验证系统确认。所有步骤均基于Python代码实现，确保可解释性。

Result: 在Cryptonite数据集上，该系统实现了最新的性能表现，且每个解决方案的解释均可通过Python代码查看。

Conclusion: 该系统为加密填字游戏线索的解决提供了高效且可解释的方法，展示了LLM在复杂语言任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

Motivation: 手动生成MCQs耗时耗力，LLMs为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 通过向LLMs注入知识而非依赖其固有知识，对比了三种模型生成MCQs的效果，并让21名教育工作者参与评估。

Result: GPT-3.5在多项指标中表现最佳，但教育领域对AI的接受度仍有限。

Conclusion: LLMs在生成MCQs方面具有潜力，可为教育体验带来改进，但需进一步推动AI在教育中的应用。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

Conclusion: 研究为开发多语言LLM教育工具提供了实用见解，强调语言对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

Motivation: 解决LLM在低资源语言上因训练数据不足而表现不佳的问题。

Method: 结合LLM与双语翻译模型，通过维度对齐层和定制Transformer将低资源输入转换为高资源表示，仅训练轻量适配模块。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in high-resource languages but struggle
with low-resource languages due to limited training data. This paper presents
TALL (Trainable Architecture for Enhancing LLM Performance in Low-Resource
Languages), which integrates an LLM with two bilingual translation models. TALL
transforms low-resource inputs into high-resource representations, leveraging
the LLM's capabilities while preserving linguistic features through dimension
alignment layers and custom transformers. Our experiments on Hebrew demonstrate
significant improvements over several baselines, including direct use, naive
translation, and fine-tuning approaches. The architecture employs a
parameter-efficient strategy, freezing pre-trained components while training
only lightweight adapter modules, balancing computational efficiency with
performance gains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的自我报告行为是否可被视为“内省”，并通过两个案例分析了其合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于LLMs的语言能力和自我报告行为引发了对其是否具备内省能力的疑问。

Method: 通过分析LLMs的两个自我报告案例，评估其是否符合内省的定义。

Result: 第一个案例（描述创作过程）不被视为内省；第二个案例（推断自身温度参数）可视为内省的最小示例。

Conclusion: LLMs的某些行为可被有限地视为内省，但缺乏意识体验。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiCoRe框架通过发散-收敛推理方法提升零样本事件检测性能，平均F1分数比基线高4-7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在零样本事件检测中因复杂事件本体和领域特定触发器提取而受限的问题。

Method: 采用Dreamer（发散推理）和Grounder（收敛推理）结合的方法，辅以LLM-Judge验证输出。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优于基线，平均F1分数提升4-7%。

Conclusion: DiCoRe是一个强大的零样本事件检测框架。

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

Conclusion: 研究为听觉属性处理提供了新见解，并展示了改进LALMs的方法，为未来优化奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLMs）中社会、人口和性别偏见的内部结构表现，以理解其机制。

Method: 采用机制解释方法，探索不同指标识别偏见行为相关的内部边，并通过系统消融实验评估其稳定性、定位性和泛化性。

Result: 偏见计算高度集中在少数层，且随微调设置变化；移除偏见组件会减少偏见输出，但影响其他NLP任务。

Conclusion: 偏见在模型中具有局部性，且与其他任务共享重要组件，移除偏见需谨慎权衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

Conclusion: 研究表明语言模型具备反事实推理潜力，尤其在序列数据上的表现为进一步研究反事实故事生成提供了初步证据。

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有应用中依赖独立嵌入模型导致的系统复杂性和理解不一致问题。

Method: 通过插入特殊标记和调整注意力掩码，生成文本的摘要嵌入，适用于任何现有LLM的后训练或微调阶段。

Result: 在MTEB文本嵌入基准上显著提升性能，同时几乎不影响MMLU NLP基准表现。

Conclusion: GEM方法为LLM提供了先进的文本嵌入能力，同时保持了其原始NLP性能。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统中外部知识与LLMs固有知识冲突影响性能，现有方法因上下文冗长而效果有限。

Method: 提出Micro-Act框架，通过分层动作空间自适应分解知识源，进行细粒度比较。

Result: 在5个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在时间和语义冲突类型中表现突出。

Conclusion: Micro-Act在冲突和非冲突问题上均表现稳健，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

Motivation: 现有HTC模型对标签层次结构的处理方式不同且互补，但未有效结合。

Method: 使用对比学习同时学习层次感知的文本表示和路径引导的层次表示，并合并两种概率分布。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，HTC-CLIP的Macro F1分数比现有最优模型提高了0.99-2.37%。

Conclusion: HTC-CLIP成功结合了两种互补方法，显著提升了分层文本分类的性能。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

Method: 采用监督微调方法和各向同性正则化训练领域特定句子嵌入器，结合多语言知识蒸馏策略实现跨领域泛化。

Result: 在加拿大和墨西哥的电子商务客户关怀数据集上，少样本意图检测的准确率比现有SOTA模型提高了20-23%。

Conclusion: 提出的模型架构在跨领域意图分类任务中表现出色，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

Conclusion: ProRefine不仅提高准确性，还能让小模型匹配大模型性能，具有高效、可扩展和普及高性能AI的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Motivation: 现实中的LLM需要移除敏感、过时或专有信息，现有方法存在优化不稳定和性能下降问题。

Method: 将遗忘问题转化为约束优化，使用logit-margin flattening损失函数，并通过原始对偶算法求解。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法高效稳定，能有效移除目标信息并保留下游实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

Motivation: 解决预训练数据不足的问题，尤其是高质量文本稀缺，探索如何利用被过滤的低质量数据。

Method: 提出REWIRE方法，通过指导性改写（guided rewrite）将低质量文档转化为有用数据，增加合成数据在预训练集中的比例。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的实验中，混合高质量原始文本与改写文本分别带来1.0、1.3和2.5个百分点的性能提升，优于单纯使用过滤数据或2倍原始数据。

Conclusion: 改写低质量网络文本是一种简单有效的预训练数据扩展方法，REWIRE方法显著优于其他合成数据生成技术。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Conclusion: 该方法简单、通用，适用于不同架构和解码算法。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Common Pile v0.1，一个用于大语言模型预训练的8TB开放许可文本数据集，解决了现有数据集规模小或质量低的问题。通过训练两个7B参数的模型，验证了其性能与未授权文本训练的模型相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型训练中未授权文本使用的知识产权和伦理问题，提供高质量开放许可数据集。

Method: 收集、整理并发布Common Pile v0.1数据集，训练两个7B参数的LLM（Comma v0.1-1T和Comma v0.1-2T）验证性能。

Result: 训练的模型性能与未授权文本训练的模型（如Llama 1和2 7B）相当。

Conclusion: Common Pile v0.1为开放许可文本训练高性能LLM提供了可行方案，并开源了数据集和代码。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

### [261] [An Expansion-Based Approach for Quantified Integer Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04452)
*Michael Hartisch,Leroy Chew*

Main category: cs.DM

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于扩展的QIP解决方法，利用CEGAR技术，显著提升了多阶段鲁棒离散优化问题的求解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QIP结合了QBF和整数规划的优势，但现有方法仅限于搜索范式，扩展方法的潜力尚未开发。

Method: 采用CEGAR技术，将QBF的扩展方法应用于QIP，并嵌入优化框架。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在特定实例中优于现有搜索求解器，且在QBF扩展求解器上也有性能提升。

Conclusion: 扩展方法为QIP提供了新的解决途径，尤其在多阶段鲁棒优化中表现突出。

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance
over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore,
the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable
performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在医学中的影响有限，主要原因是技术中心方法导致系统与临床实践（如诊断推理和决策）不兼容。

Method: 提出了一种社会技术概念化方法，设计数据驱动的支持工具，以补充医生的认知和认知活动。

Result: 该方法优先考虑实际影响，而非在无关基准上的超人性能。

Conclusion: 通过社会技术方法，可以更好地将人工智能工具融入临床实践，提升其实际价值。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to revolutionise medicine, yet its impact
remains limited because of the pervasive translational gap. We posit that the
prevailing technology-centric approaches underpin this challenge, rendering
such systems fundamentally incompatible with clinical practice, specifically
diagnostic reasoning and decision making. Instead, we propose a novel
sociotechnical conceptualisation of data-driven support tools designed to
complement doctors' cognitive and epistemic activities. Crucially, it
prioritises real-world impact over superhuman performance on inconsequential

TL;DR: 该论文提出AI增强的团队优化框架，包括团队形成算法、实时反馈系统和团队动态模拟工具，以提升团队满意度、凝聚力和表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有团队优化工具依赖静态数据或特定场景，无法适应动态团队需求，导致成员不满和表现下降。

Result: 框架旨在提升团队满意度、凝聚力和长期表现。

Conclusion: AI工具可动态优化团队，弥补现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.

TL;DR: 本文利用1992年至2022年的全国犯罪受害调查，研究了收入、教育、就业和关键人口因素如何影响犯罪受害类型（暴力犯罪与财产犯罪）。通过平衡分类和逻辑回归模型，发现社会经济因素是犯罪受害的主要驱动因素，而人口因素进一步影响受害类型。结果表明，高收入和高等教育降低了暴力犯罪的风险，而男性、年轻人和少数族裔面临更高的暴力犯罪风险。地理上，郊区模型的预测性能最强，而农村地区的犯罪仍难以预测。

Motivation: 研究社会经济和人口因素如何影响犯罪受害类型，以指导针对性的干预措施。

Method: 使用平衡分类和逻辑回归模型，分析全国犯罪受害调查数据，评估社会经济和人口因素对犯罪受害类型的影响。

Result: 高收入和高等教育降低了暴力犯罪的风险；男性、年轻人和少数族裔面临更高的暴力犯罪风险；郊区模型的预测性能最强，农村地区的犯罪难以预测。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要针对不同地区制定特定的干预措施，如大都市的教育投资、农村社区的经济支持和基于人口特征的预防策略。

Abstract: In this short article, I leverage the National Crime Victimization Survey
from 1992 to 2022 to examine how income, education, employment, and key
demographic factors shape the type of crime victims experience (violent vs
property). Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models
evaluated by F1-score, there is an isolation of the socioeconomic drivers of
victimization "Group A" models and then an introduction of demographic factors
such as age, gender, race, and marital status controls called "Group B" models.
The results consistently proves that higher income and education lower the odds
of violent relative to property crime, while men younger individuals and racial
minorities face disproportionately higher violentcrime risks. On the geographic
spectrum, the suburban models achieve the strongest predictive performance with
an accuracy of 0.607 and F1 of 0.590, urban areas benefit from adding education
and employment predictors and crime in rural areas are still unpredictable
using these current factors. The patterns found in this study shows the need
for specific interventions like educational investments in metropolitan
settings economic support in rural communities and demographicaware prevention
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RAG等应用中，ANNS结果可能过于相似，需要同时保持与查询相似性和多样性。

Method: 预计算一个截断表，总结相近的向量；在过滤阶段，贪心查找表以删除候选中的冗余向量。

Result: LotusFilter在类似真实RAG应用的场景中运行快速（0.02毫秒/查询），使用OpenAI嵌入等功能。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

TL;DR: RSVP是一个两阶段框架，通过视觉提示将多模态推理与视觉分割结合，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在视觉定位和分割任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在推理能力上表现优异，但缺乏明确的视觉定位和分割机制，导致认知推理与视觉感知之间存在差距。

Method: RSVP采用两阶段框架：推理阶段通过多模态链式视觉提示生成区域建议；分割阶段通过视觉-语言分割模块（VLSM）结合文本和视觉线索生成精确分割掩码。

Result: RSVP在ReasonSeg任务中超越现有方法，gIoU和cIoU分别提升6.5和9.2，在零样本设置下SegInW任务中达到49.7 mAP。

Conclusion: RSVP为认知推理与结构化视觉理解的结合提供了有效且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个多图像推理基准MMRB，用于评估多模态大语言模型在多图像任务中的结构化推理能力，发现开源模型与商业模型存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM基准主要关注单图像任务或仅评估最终答案的多图像任务，缺乏对多图像推理能力的系统评估。

Method: 设计了包含92个子任务的MMRB基准，涵盖空间、时间和语义推理，并采用GPT-4o生成多解法和CoT风格标注。提出基于开源LLM的句子级匹配框架。

Result: 实验表明开源MLLM在多图像推理任务中显著落后于商业模型，且当前多模态奖励模型几乎无法处理多图像奖励排序任务。

Conclusion: MMRB填补了多图像推理评估的空白，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

Conclusion: ReXVQA为评估通用放射学AI系统设定了新标准，为下一代AI系统的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰球在视频中检测困难，现有方法未充分利用球员行为的上下文线索。

Method: PLUCC包含上下文编码器、特征金字塔编码器和门控解码器，结合球员姿态和多尺度特征。

Result: PLUCC在PuckDataset上表现优异，平均精度提升12.2%，RSLE提升25%。

Conclusion: 上下文理解对冰球检测至关重要，对自动化体育分析有广泛意义。

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DNN编码模型能预测大脑对视觉刺激的响应，但无法揭示具体特征。本研究旨在通过激活最大化技术解决这一局限。

Method: 提取并自适应降采样预训练Inception V3网络的激活，使用线性回归预测fMRI响应，并应用激活最大化生成优化图像。

Result: 生成的图像与已知选择性特征一致，并能可靠驱动目标脑区活动。

Conclusion: 激活最大化技术可成功应用于DNN编码模型，为人类视觉系统的响应特征提供了灵活的分析工具。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR在并行生成高分辨率图像时存在质量下降、序列长度超线性增长和采样计划固定的问题，HMAR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: HMAR采用马尔可夫过程和多步掩码生成技术，逐级预测分辨率，并通过高效的块稀疏注意力核优化性能。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256和512x512基准测试中，HMAR表现优于或匹配VAR、扩散和自回归基线模型，训练和推理速度分别提升2.5倍和1.75倍。

Conclusion: HMAR不仅提升了图像生成质量和效率，还增加了采样计划的灵活性，并能零样本应用于图像编辑任务。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用第一人称设备进行高动态范围场景的光真实重构的挑战，提出了基于视觉-惯性束调整（VIBA）的高频轨迹校准方法和基于高斯泼溅的物理图像形成模型，显著提升了重构质量。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法通常假设使用设备的视觉-惯性里程计系统估计的帧率6DoF位姿，可能忽略像素级重构所需的关键细节。

Method: 1. 使用VIBA校准滚动快门RGB相机的时间戳和运动；2. 在高斯泼溅中引入物理图像形成模型，解决传感器特性问题。

Result: 实验表明，VIBA和图像形成模型分别带来+1 dB的PSNR提升，重构质量显著提高。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多种光照条件下均表现优异，为光真实重构提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

TL;DR: Gen-n-Val是一个新型数据生成框架，利用Layer Diffusion、LLMs和VLLMs生成高质量的单对象掩码和多样化背景，显著减少无效数据并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉任务中数据稀缺和标签噪声问题，尤其是对象检测和实例分割中合成数据生成的质量问题。

Method: Gen-n-Val包含两个代理：LD提示代理（LLM优化提示生成高质量数据）和数据验证代理（VLLM过滤低质量数据），通过TextGrad优化系统提示。

Result: 将无效合成数据从50%降至7%，在COCO实例分割中提升1% mAP，开放词汇对象检测中提升7.1% mAP。

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val显著提升了合成数据的质量和模型性能，适用于实例分割和对象检测任务。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出HoliSafe数据集和SafeLLaVA模型，解决现有视觉语言模型（VLM）安全性的不足，通过全面覆盖图像-文本组合和引入可学习的安全元标记及专用安全头，显著提升模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM安全方法存在数据集覆盖不全和架构创新不足的问题，导致模型易受攻击且安全性不足。

Method: 提出HoliSafe数据集，覆盖五种安全/不安全图像-文本组合；设计SafeLLaVA模型，引入安全元标记和安全头，增强模型内在安全性。

Result: SafeLLaVA在多个VLM基准测试中达到最先进的安全性能；HoliSafe揭示了现有模型的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: HoliSafe和SafeLLaVA为VLM安全性研究提供了新方向，推动多模态对齐的进一步发展。

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Method: 使用LlaVA-Next模型分析图像概念的线性可解码特征，并通过稀疏自编码器训练提高特征多样性。

Result: 发现图像和文本特征在深层逐渐共享，尽管初始表示较为分离。

Conclusion: 多模态模型的深层表示趋向于共享特征，稀疏自编码器有助于提高特征的多样性。

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Method: 采用双流架构，一个流用于物理模型估计传输图和背景光，另一个流通过胶囊聚类提取实体级特征。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，PSNR提高了0.5dB，计算复杂度仅为现有方法的三分之一。

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RAP的数据选择方法，通过识别稀疏的认知样本，显著减少训练数据量和计算成本，同时提升多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法认为多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）需要大量训练数据以提高推理能力，但数据冗余和计算成本高。本文挑战这一假设，发现仅少数样本（认知样本）能有效触发推理。

Method: 提出RAP方法，包括两个互补的估计器（CDE和ACE）来识别认知样本，并引入DRM模块替换简单样本以增强复杂性。

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验表明，RAP仅需9.3%的训练数据即可实现更优性能，同时减少43%以上的计算成本。

Conclusion: RAP通过高效数据选择，显著提升了多模态推理的效率和性能，为MLLMs的训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的IQA模型鲁棒性设计方法，通过架构先验而非数据驱动来提升对抗攻击的抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IQA模型易受对抗攻击，传统数据驱动防御方法效果有限，作者认为鲁棒性应从设计层面解决。

Method: 通过正交信息流和规范保持操作重构模型内部结构，结合剪枝和微调进一步稳定系统。

Result: 设计出的IQA架构无需对抗训练即可抵御攻击，保持原始模型性能。

Conclusion: 论文倡导从数据优化转向设计优化，为模型鲁棒性提供新思路。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法依赖固定扰动预算，无法适应实例特定的鲁棒性特征，限制了其效果。

Method: DES动态调整每实例和每训练迭代的扰动预算，结合决策边界距离、预测置信度和模型不确定性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上，DES显著优于固定预算和现有自适应方法，提升了鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: DES为实例感知、数据驱动的对抗训练方法开辟了新途径，并提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

Conclusion: Rectified Point Flow 通过统一框架和自监督学习，显著提升了点云配准和形状组装的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

Motivation: 3D室内场景合成的布局生成由于数据集有限，现有方法要么过拟合，要么依赖预定义约束，牺牲了灵活性。DirectLayout旨在生成开放词汇且符合用户指令的场景。

Method: DirectLayout分三阶段生成布局：生成鸟瞰图（BEV）、将其提升到3D空间、细化物体放置。采用Chain-of-Thought激活和CoT-Grounded生成布局奖励，并通过迭代资产-布局对齐解决不匹配问题。

Result: 实验表明，DirectLayout在语义一致性、泛化性和物理合理性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DirectLayout通过大语言模型的空间推理能力，实现了高质量、灵活的3D场景布局生成。

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

Conclusion: RAS框架通过多模态交互显著提升了分割模型在复杂查询中的表现，为全模态引用表达分割任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We

a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

### [288] [Stable Vision Concept Transformers for Medical Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05286)
*Lijie Hu,Songning Lai,Yuan Hua,Shu Yang,Jingfeng Zhang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Vision Concept Transformer (VCT)和Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT)以解决现有概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)在医学领域中的实用性和稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学领域对透明度的需求促使研究者关注可解释AI (XAI)，但现有CBMs仅依赖概念特征而忽略医学图像的内在特征嵌入，且对输入扰动的解释不稳定。

Method: VCT通过结合概念特征与图像特征提升决策能力；SVCT基于VCT，利用Vision Transformer (ViT)和Denoised Diffusion Smoothing增强稳定性和解释的可靠性。

Result: 在四个医学数据集上的实验表明，VCT和SVCT在保持准确性的同时具有可解释性，SVCT在扰动下仍能提供稳定的解释。

Conclusion: VCT和SVCT解决了CBMs在医学领域的局限性，兼具实用性和稳定性，满足医学应用需求。

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

### [289] [RoboRefer: Towards Spatial Referring with Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04308)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboRefer是一种3D感知的视觉语言模型，通过监督微调（SFT）和强化微调（RFT）提升空间指代任务的精确理解和多步推理能力，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂3D场景理解和动态空间指代任务中表现不足，需要更精确的模型。

Method: 提出RoboRefer，结合SFT和RFT训练方法，并引入大规模数据集RefSpatial和基准RefSpatial-Bench。

Result: SFT训练的RoboRefer在空间理解任务中达到89.6%的成功率，RFT训练的模型在基准测试中超越其他基线模型17.4%。

Conclusion: RoboRefer在空间指代任务中表现卓越，并可应用于多种机器人控制策略中。

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

Conclusion: cuVSLAM是一种高效、灵活的VSLAM解决方案，适用于广泛的机器人应用场景。

Abstract: Accurate and robust pose estimation is a key requirement for any autonomous
robot. We present cuVSLAM, a state-of-the-art solution for visual simultaneous
localization and mapping, which can operate with a variety of visual-inertial
sensor suites, including multiple RGB and depth cameras, and inertial
measurement units. cuVSLAM supports operation with as few as one RGB camera to
as many as 32 cameras, in arbitrary geometric configurations, thus supporting a
wide range of robotic setups. cuVSLAM is specifically optimized using CUDA to
deploy in real-time applications with minimal computational overhead on
edge-computing devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson. We present the design and
implementation of cuVSLAM, example use cases, and empirical results on several
state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrating the best-in-class performance of
cuVSLAM.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LLM和VLM的层次框架，用于异构多机器人系统的任务分解与执行，实验验证了其在动态环境中的适应性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态模型难以应对任务多样性和动态环境，需要通用智能来协调异构机器人的高层推理与低层执行。

Method: 采用层次框架，LLM负责任务分解和全局语义地图构建，VLM从航拍图像提取语义标签和空间信息支持局部规划。

Result: 实验证明框架在动态环境中具有适应性和鲁棒性，首次展示了结合VLM感知与LLM推理的空中-地面异构系统。

Conclusion: 该框架为异构多机器人系统在复杂任务中的协作提供了新思路，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks
requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches
relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic
environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can
bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous
agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a
prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision
Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic
map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D
spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this
framework, the aerial robot follows a globally optimized semantic path and
continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local
semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where
implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes
arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in
dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based
perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Conclusion: SGN-CIRL通过3D场景图和渐进式学习策略，有效提升了导航性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: The 3D scene graph models spatial relationships between objects, enabling the
agent to efficiently navigate in a partially observable environment and predict
the location of the target object.This paper proposes an original framework
named SGN-CIRL (3D Scene Graph-Based Reinforcement Learning Navigation) for
mapless reinforcement learning-based robot navigation with learnable
representation of open-vocabulary 3D scene graph. To accelerate and stabilize
the training of reinforcement learning-based algorithms, the framework also
employs imitation learning and curriculum learning. The first one enables the
agent to learn from demonstrations, while the second one structures the
training process by gradually increasing task complexity from simple to more
advanced scenarios. Numerical experiments conducted in the Isaac Sim
environment showed that using a 3D scene graph for reinforcement learning
significantly increased the success rate in difficult navigation cases. The

Result: 校准后的OIO在冷启动嗅觉导航任务中表现出性能提升。

Conclusion: 提出的OIO校准方法能够有效提高气味源定位的精度，为相关应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic
data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial
odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with
inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental
factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make
OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for
calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types.
Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in
localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use
cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our
process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration
improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在室温离子液体（RTILs）中，高粘度和慢质量传输导致测量时间过长，需要一种更快速的方法。

Method: 通过应用推理算法对初始瞬态电流响应进行分析，准确预测稳态电化学参数，无需硬件修改。

Result: 与标准计时安培法相比，该方法在保持合理精度的同时，显著缩短了数据采集时间。

Conclusion: 该方法在分析化学、传感器技术和电池科学中具有广泛应用前景，特别是在需要快速电化学定量的领域。

Abstract: Chronoamperometry (CA) is a fundamental electrochemical technique used for
quantifying redox-active species. However, in room-temperature ionic liquids
(RTILs), the high viscosity and slow mass transport often lead to extended
measurement durations. This paper presents a novel mathematical regression
approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly
faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1-4 seconds or
longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current
response, this method accurately predicts steady-state electrochemical
parameters without requiring additional hardware modifications. The approach is
validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is
demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data
acquisition time. The implications of this technique are explored in analytical
chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, where rapid electrochemical
quantification is critical. Our technique is focused on enabling faster
multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements for rapid olfactory and
electrochemical analysis.

Conclusion: ChemReservoir是一个通用且开源的化学启发储层计算工具，解决了以往工具的局限性。

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the
inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical
systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of
reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous
studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically
inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction
network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool
based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed
mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited
their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a
proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source
framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the
former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework
for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also
addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced
testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various
cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a
range of configurations in memory capacity tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种简化神经网络解决最优控制问题的方法，通过分离训练与优化过程，无需在训练中考虑成本函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在训练神经网络时需结合数据、微分方程残差和目标成本，导致架构复杂。本文旨在简化这一过程。

Method: 使用DeepONet等简单神经算子架构，结合无约束优化方法，通过微分方程残差的惩罚项和自动微分计算控制梯度。

Result: 在九个不同的最优控制问题上验证了方法的有效性，展示了准确且一致的性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，简化架构和分离训练与优化过程可高效解决多种最优控制问题。

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

Motivation: 解决随机多目标优化问题中计算资源消耗大的问题，同时提高算法的效率和准确性。

Method: MOPBnB(so)算法在任意解处仅评估一次噪声函数，并利用邻域解估计目标函数。通过有限时间性能分析和渐近收敛性证明其有效性。

Result: 算法在计算资源消耗上显著优于多次复制的变体，并在测试问题上表现优于遗传算法NSGA-II。

Conclusion: MOPBnB(so)是一种高效且准确的多目标优化算法，适用于随机多目标优化问题。

Abstract: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm named Multiple
Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))
is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and the associated
efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.
MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses
neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, in contrast to a
variant that uses multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective
functions. A finite-time performance analysis for deterministic multi-objective
problems provides a bound on the probability that MOPBnB(so) captures the
Pareto optimal set. Asymptotic convergence of MOPBnB(so) on stochastic problems
is derived, in that the algorithm captures the Pareto optimal set and the
estimations converge to the true objective function values. Numerical results
reveal that the variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in
terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). In addition, numerical
results show that MOPBnB(so) outperforms a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test
problems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GARG-AML的新型图分析方法，用于量化洗钱风险，通过单一可解释的指标评估交易网络中节点的风险。该方法在计算效率、检测能力和透明度之间取得了平衡，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洗钱占全球GDP的2%-5%，而传统的网络嵌入方法多为黑箱模型，难以被企业采用。因此，需要一种透明且高效的方法来检测洗钱行为，尤其是拆分交易（smurfing）。

Method: GARG-AML通过分析每个节点在二阶交易网络中的结构，生成一个可解释的风险评分。结合树基方法和邻居节点的评分，进一步提升检测能力。

Result: 在大规模合成和开源网络上的实验表明，GARG-AML在拆分交易检测上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GARG-AML展示了基础网络特性在欺诈检测中的潜力，为反洗钱工作提供了高效且透明的工具。

Abstract: Money laundering poses a significant challenge as it is estimated to account
for 2%-5% of the global GDP. This has compelled regulators to impose stringent
controls on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading
these controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into
smaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve
multiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has
become an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have
focused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has
hindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a
novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single
interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction
network of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,
GARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection
power and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML
workflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score
calculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores
of the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic
and open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current
state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency
matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work
highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing
fraud detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散变换器的去噪框架，用于快速生成高质量的质子治疗剂量分布图，解决了低统计量蒙特卡洛模拟的精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强度调制质子治疗（IMPT）对解剖变化敏感，需要快速准确的剂量计算，但减少粒子数会降低蒙特卡洛模拟的精度。

Method: 使用扩散变换器框架，以噪声剂量图和CT图像为输入，高统计量剂量图为真实值，结合多种损失函数进行训练。

Result: 模型在不同部位的剂量分布图中表现出低误差（MAE）和高Gamma通过率（>92%），DVH指标与真实值接近。

Conclusion: 该框架虽仅基于头颈部数据训练，但在多个疾病部位表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor
coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease
sites.

Abstract: In this note, we evaluate the performances, the features and the
user-experience of some methods (and their implementations) designed for
tensor- (or data-) based multivariate function construction and approximation.
To this aim, a collection of multivariate functions extracted from contributive
works coming from different communities, is suggested. First, these functions
with varying complexity (e.g. number and degree of the variables) and nature
(e.g. rational, irrational, differentiable or not, symmetric, etc.) are used to
construct tensors, each of different dimension and size on the disk. Second,
grounded on this tensor, we inspect performances of each considered method
(e.g. the accuracy, the computational time, the parameters tuning impact,
etc.). Finally, considering the "best" parameter tuning set, we compare each
method using multiple evaluation criteria. The purpose of this note is not to
rank the methods but rather to evaluate as fairly as possible the different
available strategies, with the idea in mind to guide users to understand the
process, the possibilities, the advantages and the limits brought by each
tools. The contribution claimed is to suggest a complete benchmark collection
of some available tools for tensor approximation by surrogate models (e.g.
rational functions, networks, etc.). In addition, as contributors of the
multivariate Loewner Framework (mLF) approach (and its side implementation in
MDSPACK), attention and details of the latter are more explicitly given, in
order to provide readers a digest of this contributive work and some details

Conclusion: 神经网络离散化结合Rayleigh商和Gram-Schmidt正交化，为连续特征值问题提供了独特的解决方案。

Abstract: From characterizing the speed of a thermal system's response to computing
natural modes of vibration, eigenvalue analysis is ubiquitous in engineering.
In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment
compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed
machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of
solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to
their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of
the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete
eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more
specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called
the "Rayleigh quotient" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for
finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and
nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss
the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating
solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from
engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective,
Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous
eigenvalue problems.

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing $\ell$-page queue layouts, which are
linear arrangements of vertices accompanied with an assignment of the edges to
pages from one to $\ell$ that avoid the nesting of edges on any of the pages.
Inspired by previous work in the extension of stack layouts, here we consider
the setting of extending a partial $\ell$-page queue layout into a complete one
and primarily analyze the problem through the refined lens of parameterized
complexity. We obtain novel algorithms and lower bounds which provide a
detailed picture of the problem's complexity under various measures of
incompleteness, and identify surprising distinctions between queue and stack
layouts in the extension setting.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 音频-文本模型在零样本环境声音分类中表现优异，但背景噪声会显著降低其性能。本文提出一种新方法，量化并整合背景噪声的影响，无需重新训练模型即可提升分类效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 背景噪声会显著降低音频-文本模型的分类性能，而现有方法未充分考虑这一问题。

Method: 提出一种量化背景噪声贡献的方法，并分析音频与文本嵌入之间的模态差距，通过缩小这一差距提升分类性能。

Result: 该方法在不重新训练模型的情况下，显著提升了分类准确性，并在不同背景和信噪比条件下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性和鲁棒性，适用于多种环境，为音频-文本模型的性能优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI音乐生成模型基于固定数据集训练，难以准确响应用户输入，而音乐具有高度主观性，需要个性化调整。

Method: 采用人类计算方法，聚合用户评分作为损失函数，结合遗传算法对模型进行微调。

Result: 初步测试中，第一轮迭代评分平均提升0.2，第二轮进一步提升0.39。

Conclusion: 该方法通过用户反馈逐步优化模型，显著提升了音乐生成的主观质量。

Abstract: AI music generation has advanced rapidly, with models like diffusion and
autoregressive algorithms enabling high-fidelity outputs. These tools can alter
styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as
spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel
music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which
makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input
accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective
and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.
In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the
performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The
human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to
use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic
algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance
of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this
approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each
iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating
increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved
upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM), which have developed in recent years, enable
credit risk assessment through the analysis of financial texts such as analyst
reports and corporate disclosures. This paper presents the first systematic
review and taxonomy focusing on LLMbased approaches in credit risk estimation.
We determined the basic model architectures by selecting 60 relevant papers
published between 2020-2025 with the PRISMA research strategy. And we examined
the data used for scenarios such as credit default prediction and risk
analysis. Since the main focus of the paper is interpretability, we classify
concepts such as explainability mechanisms, chain of thought prompts and
natural language justifications for LLM-based credit models. The taxonomy
organizes the literature under four main headings: model architectures, data
types, explainability mechanisms and application areas. Based on this analysis,
we highlight the main future trends and research gaps for LLM-based credit
scoring systems. This paper aims to be a reference paper for artificial

Result: TQml Simulator在多数情况下性能优于Pennylane的默认模拟器2至100倍。

Conclusion: 针对不同电路层选择最优模拟方法可显著提升性能，TQml Simulator为量子机器学习提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are
typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed
numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in
this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific
techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state
vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine
Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for
a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a
tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in
the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these
insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that
employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.
We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets,
such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM
quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent
Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending
on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the
hardware used.

noisy, and limited. Overall, the prediction of diffusivity $D$ tends to be more
accurate than that of hydraulic conductivity $K.$ Among the models considered,
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) demonstrate the
highest robustness, achieving near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors.

Result: 独占交易占获胜区块费用的85%；许多交易被延迟且与失败提议者相关；套利机器人在CEX上的交易价格优于Binance。

Conclusion: 独占交易和延迟交易现象显著，套利机器人行为揭示了CEX和DEX之间的价格差异。

Abstract: We analyze blocks proposed for inclusion in the Ethereum blockchain during 8
minutes on December 3rd, 2024. Our dataset comprises 38 winning blocks, 15,097
proposed blocks, 10,793 unique transactions, and 2,380,014 transaction-block
pairings. We find that exclusive transactions--transactions present only in
blocks proposed by a single builder--account for 85% of the fees paid by all
transactions included in winning blocks. We also find that a surprisingly large
number of user transactions are delayed: although proposed during a bidding
cycle, they are not included in the corresponding winning block. Many such
delayed transactions are exclusive to a losing builder. We also identify two
arbitrage bots trading between decentralized (DEX) and centralized exchanges
(CEX). By examining their bidding dynamics, we estimate that the implied price
at which these bots trade USDC/WETH and USDT/WETH on CEXes is between 3.4 and
4.2 basis points better than the contemporaneous price reported on Binance.

Motivation: 漏洞报告通常缺乏PoC利用，导致修复和测试困难。PoCGen旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合LLM、静态和动态分析技术，自主生成和验证PoC利用。

Result: 在SecBench.js数据集上成功率为77%，新数据集为39%，显著优于基线（提升45个百分点）。

Conclusion: PoCGen是一种高效、低成本的PoC生成方法，显著提升了漏洞修复效率。

Abstract: Security vulnerabilities in software packages are a significant concern for
developers and users alike. Patching these vulnerabilities in a timely manner
is crucial to restoring the integrity and security of software systems.
However, previous work has shown that vulnerability reports often lack
proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits, which are essential for fixing the
vulnerability, testing patches, and avoiding regressions. Creating a PoC
exploit is challenging because vulnerability reports are informal and often
incomplete, and because it requires a detailed understanding of how inputs
passed to potentially vulnerable APIs may reach security-relevant sinks. In
this paper, we present PoCGen, a novel approach to autonomously generate and
validate PoC exploits for vulnerabilities in npm packages. This is the first
fully autonomous approach to use large language models (LLMs) in tandem with
static and dynamic analysis techniques for PoC exploit generation. PoCGen
leverages an LLM for understanding vulnerability reports, for generating
candidate PoC exploits, and for validating and refining them. Our approach
successfully generates exploits for 77% of the vulnerabilities in the
SecBench.js dataset and 39% in a new, more challenging dataset of 794 recent
vulnerabilities. This success rate significantly outperforms a recent baseline
(by 45 absolute percentage points), while imposing an average cost of $0.02 per
generated exploit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统的攻击容易被检测，需要更隐蔽的攻击方式，同时需改进防御方法。

Method: 提出基于注意力模式的Normalized Passage Attention Score和Attention-Variance Filter算法，检测并过滤毒化段落。

Result: 防御方法提升准确率约20%，但适应性攻击仍能达到35%的成功率。

Conclusion: 隐蔽攻击对防御提出更高挑战，需进一步研究中间信号分析。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack
success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决敏感医疗数据在微调大语言模型时的隐私泄露风险。

Method: 使用50,232份放射学报告，通过差分隐私低秩适应（DP-LoRA）在高中低隐私预算下微调模型，评估了BERT和ALBERT架构的性能。

Result: 在中等隐私保证下，DP微调模型在MIMIC-CXR和CT-RATE数据集上的加权F1分数分别为0.88和0.59，接近非隐私基线（0.90和0.78）。

Conclusion: 差分隐私微调结合LoRA能有效保护隐私并完成多异常分类，为医疗数据应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality
classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during
fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with
sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining
classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology
reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE
computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of
LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels
from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)
in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =
{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

Motivation: 在基于扰动的防御下，现有编码器窃取攻击性能受限，需提升攻击效果。

Method: BESA包含扰动检测和恢复模块，结合生成模型恢复干净特征向量。

Result: 实验表明，BESA在面对先进防御时，显著提升替代编码器准确率，最高达24.63%。

Conclusion: BESA有效克服了基于扰动的防御，显著增强了编码器窃取攻击的性能。

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

Abstract: The complexity of modern computing environments and the growing
sophistication of cyber threats necessitate a more robust, adaptive, and
automated approach to security enforcement. In this paper, we present a
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack
mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context
learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how
our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

Motivation: 现有公共数据集范围狭窄，无法全面评估恶意软件分类器，且缺乏逃避检测的文件。EMBER2024旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过合作创建EMBER2024数据集，包含320万文件的哈希、元数据、特征向量和标签，支持七种分类任务，并引入“挑战”集。

Result: EMBER2024是首个包含逃避检测恶意文件的数据集，支持多种分类任务，并引入EMBER特征版本3。

Conclusion: EMBER2024的发布将推动恶意软件研究的可重复性，并为新研究方向提供支持。

Abstract: A lack of accessible data has historically restricted malware analysis
research, and practitioners have relied heavily on datasets provided by
industry sources to advance. Existing public datasets are limited by narrow
scope - most include files targeting a single platform, have labels supporting
just one type of malware classification task, and make no effort to capture the
evasive files that make malware detection difficult in practice. We present
EMBER2024, a new dataset that enables holistic evaluation of malware
classifiers. Created in collaboration with the authors of EMBER2017 and
EMBER2018, the EMBER2024 dataset includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors,
and labels for more than 3.2 million files from six file formats. Our dataset
supports the training and evaluation of machine learning models on seven
malware classification tasks, including malware detection, malware family
classification, and malware behavior identification. EMBER2024 is the first to
include a collection of malicious files that initially went undetected by a set
of antivirus products, creating a "challenge" set to assess classifier
performance against evasive malware. This work also introduces EMBER feature
version 3, with added support for several new feature types. We are releasing
the EMBER2024 dataset to promote reproducibility and empower researchers in the
pursuit of new malware research topics.

image generators, have a tendency to memorize and inadvertently leak sensitive
information. While this tendency has critical legal implications, existing
tools are insufficient to audit the resulting risks. We hypothesize that those
tools' shortcomings are due to mismatched assumptions. Thus, we argue that
effectively measuring privacy leakage in sequence models requires leveraging
the correlations inherent in sequential generation. To illustrate this, we
adapt a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model
within-sequence correlations, thereby demonstrating how a strong existing
attack can be naturally extended to suit the structure of sequence models.
Through a case study, we show that our adaptations consistently improve the
effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional
computational costs. Our work hence serves as an important stepping stone
toward reliable memorization audits for large sequence models.

### [318] [Why LLM Safety Guardrails Collapse After Fine-tuning: A Similarity Analysis Between Alignment and Fine-tuning Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05346)
*Lei Hsiung,Tianyu Pang,Yung-Chen Tang,Linyue Song,Tsung-Yi Ho,Pin-Yu Chen,Yaoqing Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究发现上游安全对齐数据与下游微调任务之间的表示相似性对安全护栏的稳固性有显著影响，高相似性会削弱护栏，而低相似性可提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓解策略多关注事后处理或微调过程中的梯度移除，忽视了上游安全对齐数据的作用，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过实验分析上游对齐数据集与下游微调任务的表示相似性对安全护栏的影响。

Result: 高相似性削弱护栏，低相似性使模型更鲁棒，有害性评分降低达10.33%。

Conclusion: 上游数据集设计对构建稳固安全护栏至关重要，为微调服务提供商提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

TL;DR: 论文提出CMIE框架，通过生成共存关系和关联评分机制，提升多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在检测上下文无关（OOC）虚假信息中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在检测OOC虚假信息时，难以捕捉图像与文本间的深层语义关联，且证据噪声影响准确性。

Method: 提出CMIE框架，包含共存关系生成（CRG）策略和关联评分（AS）机制，识别图像与文本的共存关系并选择性利用证据。

Result: 实验表明CMIE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CMIE有效解决了MLLM在OOC虚假信息检测中的挑战，提升了性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies
have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC)
misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of
this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning
and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to
capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and
text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic
links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To
address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection
framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG)
strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the
underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively
utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多相流动模拟中的时间离散化方案多为显式或半隐式，缺乏完全耦合的隐式框架，特别是在考虑重力和毛细效应的异质多孔介质中。

Method: 采用顶点中心有限体积法进行空间离散，首次将LIMEX方法应用于多相流动问题，并使用BiCGSTAB-GMG求解线性系统。

Result: 在超级计算机上实现了高效的并行计算，支持数千处理器和数十亿自由度。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在模拟多相流动时具有高效性和可扩展性，适用于大规模计算。

Abstract: The modeling and simulation of multiphase fluid flow receive significant
attention in reservoir engineering. Many time discretization schemes for
multiphase flow equations are either explicit or semi-implicit, relying on the
decoupling between the saturation equation and the pressure equation. In this
study, we delve into a fully coupled and fully implicit framework for
simulating multiphase flow in heterogeneous porous media, considering gravity
and capillary effects. We utilize the Vertex-Centered Finite Volume Method for
spatial discretization and propose an efficient implementation of interface
conditions for heterogeneous porous media within the current scheme. Notably,
we introduce the Linearly Implicit Extrapolation Method (LIMEX) with an error
estimator, adapted for the first time to multiphase flow problems. To solve the
resulting linear system, we employ the BiCGSTAB method with the Geometric
Multigrid (GMG) preconditioner. The implementations of models and methods are
based on the open-source software: UG4. The results from parallel computations
on the supercomputer demonstrate that the scalability of our proposed framework
is sufficient, supporting a scale of thousands of processors with Degrees of
Freedom (DoF) extending up to billions.

Motivation: 传统PINN在处理复杂空间层次和边界条件时表现不佳，BridgeNet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: BridgeNet采用自适应CNN层提取局部特征，并引入动态加权损失函数以严格满足物理约束。

Result: 实验表明，BridgeNet在误差指标、收敛速度和稳定性上均优于传统PINN方法。

Conclusion: BridgeNet为计算物理领域提供了可扩展且精确的解决方案，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural
networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear,
high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which
typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture
complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In
contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature
extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that
rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments
across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves
significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to
conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in
high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in
computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology
with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to
complex system dynamics.

Conclusion: 提出了一个数论猜想，确保算法在高概率下可靠。

Abstract: Motivated by practical applications in the design of optimization compilers
for neural networks, we initiated the study of identity testing problems for
arithmetic circuits augmented with \emph{exponentiation gates} that compute the
real function $x\mapsto e^x$. These circuits compute real functions of form
$P(\vec x)/P'(\vec x)$, where both $P(\vec x)$ and $P'(\vec x)$ are exponential
polynomials
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^k f_i(\vec x)\cdot \exp\left(\frac{g_i(\vec x)}{h_i(\vec
x)}\right),
  \]
  for polynomials $f_i(\vec x),g_i(\vec x)$, and $h_i(\vec x)$.
  We formalize a black-box query model over finite fields for this class of
circuits, which is mathematical simple and reflects constraints faced by
real-world neural network compilers. We proved that a simple and efficient
randomized identity testing algorithm achieves perfect completeness and
non-trivial soundness. Concurrent with our work, the algorithm has been
implemented in the optimization compiler Mirage by Wu et al.~(OSDI 2025),
demonstrating promising empirical performance in both efficiency and soundness
error. Finally, we propose a number-theoretic conjecture under which our
algorithm is sound with high probability.

in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model
this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法泛化能力差和Transformer计算资源需求高的问题，适用于实时神经解码。

Method: 采用跨注意力模块和递归状态空间模型（SSM）结合的混合架构，支持多数据集预训练。

Result: 在猴子和人类任务中，POSSM达到与Transformer相当的解码精度，推理速度提升9倍。

Conclusion: 混合SSM在精度、速度和泛化性之间取得了平衡，适用于实时闭环应用。

Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and
neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer
interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional
methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight
but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent
Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong
generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational
requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time
settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid
architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention
module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and
causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to
new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We
evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical
decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical
applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.
Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings
improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the
exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find
that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).
These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the
gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural
decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

aim to address the challenges by introducing a new MVP evaluation framework,
denoted as \oursys, which leverages Shapley values. This approach encompasses
feature processing, win-loss model training, Shapley value allocation, and MVP
ranking determination based on players' contributions. Additionally, we
optimize our algorithm to align with expert voting results from the perspective
of causality. Finally, we substantiated the efficacy of our method through
validation using the NBA dataset and the Dunk City Dynasty dataset and
implemented online deployment in the industry.

Motivation: 传统GSA方法缺乏临床背景，导致结果冗余且难以解释，降低了可靠性和可重复性。

Method: cGSA整合了基因簇检测、富集分析和大型语言模型，以识别统计显著且生物学意义明确的通路。

Result: 在102个手动整理的基因集上，cGSA比基线方法性能提升30%以上，专家验证证实其精确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: cGSA在黑色素瘤和乳腺癌的案例研究中展示了其发现上下文特异性见解和支持针对性假设生成的潜力。

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific
insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in

Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages

seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data

Abstract: Processor chip design technology serves as a key frontier driving
breakthroughs in computer science and related fields. With the rapid
advancement of information technology, conventional design paradigms face three
major challenges: the physical constraints of fabrication technologies, the
escalating demands for design resources, and the increasing diversity of
ecosystems. Automated processor chip design has emerged as a transformative
solution to address these challenges. While recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques, have
opened new possibilities for fully automated processor chip design, substantial
challenges remain in establishing domain-specific LLMs for processor chip
design.
  In this paper, we propose QiMeng, a novel system for fully automated hardware
and software design of processor chips. QiMeng comprises three hierarchical
layers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor
Chip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and
inference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data
scarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the
middle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference
capabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design
Agent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.
Currently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully
applied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages
and providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated
hardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on
integrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up
design processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.

Conclusion: SSIMBaD框架在动漫面部着色中表现出色，兼具高保真度和泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies
existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which
rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous,
integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for
responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive
evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic
auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet
these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

Conclusion: 将第一修正案保护扩展到AI模型对社会有害，可能阻碍政府有效监管，导致错误信息泛滥。

Abstract: This paper challenges the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment
protections to outputs from large generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and
Gemini. We argue that because these models lack intentionality, their outputs
do not constitute speech as understood in the context of established legal
precedent, so there can be no speech to protect. Furthermore, if the model
outputs are not speech, users cannot claim a First Amendment speech right to
receive the outputs. We also argue that extending First Amendment rights to AI
models would not serve the fundamental purposes of free speech, such as
promoting a marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, or fostering
self-expression. In fact, granting First Amendment protections to AI models
would be detrimental to society because it would hinder the government's
ability to regulate these powerful technologies effectively, potentially
leading to the unchecked spread of misinformation and other harms.

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in
mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with
enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major
Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test
set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain
generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For
cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the
respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated
using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion
Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying
suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong
agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization
concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6%
localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists'
acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for
out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of
74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good
clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer
screening workflows in clinical practice.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at
