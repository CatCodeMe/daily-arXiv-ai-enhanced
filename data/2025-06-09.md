### [1] [Training-Free Query Optimization via LLM-Based Plan Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05853)
*Nikita Vasilenko,Alexander Demin,Vladimir Boorlakov*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: LLM-PM框架利用预训练的语言模型嵌入优化SQL查询执行，无需额外训练，通过邻居投票推荐数据库提示集，实现21%的查询延迟降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练执行计划嵌入如何指导SQL查询执行，避免额外模型训练的开销。

Method: 提出LLM-PM框架，嵌入查询的默认执行计划，通过k近邻投票推荐数据库提示集，并加入一致性检查和回退机制。

Result: 在JOB-CEB基准测试中，平均减少21%的查询延迟。

Conclusion: LLM嵌入为查询优化提供了实用改进，开启了基于嵌入的无训练优化器指导系统的新方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) embeddings offer a promising new avenue for
database query optimization. In this paper, we explore how pre-trained
execution plan embeddings can guide SQL query execution without the need for
additional model training. We introduce LLM-PM (LLM-based Plan Mapping), a
framework that embeds the default execution plan of a query, finds its k
nearest neighbors among previously executed plans, and recommends database
hintsets based on neighborhood voting. A lightweight consistency check
validates the selected hint, while a fallback mechanism searches the full hint
space when needed. Evaluated on the JOB-CEB benchmark using OpenGauss, LLM-PM
achieves an average speed-up of 21% query latency reduction. This work
highlights the potential of LLM-powered embeddings to deliver practical
improvements in query performance and opens new directions for training-free,
embedding-based optimizer guidance systems.

### [2] [Stream DaQ: Stream-First Data Quality Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06147)
*Vasileios Papastergios,Anastasios Gounaris*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种专为无界数据流设计的新型数据质量监控模型，并开发了开源框架Stream DaQ，显著优于现有方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据质量方法无法满足流式数据的实时性和上下文感知需求，亟需一种专门针对流式数据的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于流式优先概念的数据质量监控模型，包括可配置窗口机制、动态约束适应和连续评估，并开发了Python框架Stream DaQ。

Result: Stream DaQ在性能和功能上显著优于现有生产级方案，同时支持更丰富的流式功能。

Conclusion: Stream DaQ通过其流式优先设计和Python原生集成，为数据科学社区提供了高效的连续质量监控工具。

Abstract: Data quality is fundamental to modern data science workflows, where data
continuously flows as unbounded streams feeding critical downstream tasks, from
elementary analytics to advanced artificial intelligence models. Existing data
quality approaches either focus exclusively on static data or treat streaming
as an extension of batch processing, lacking the temporal granularity and
contextual awareness required for true streaming applications. In this paper,
we present a novel data quality monitoring model specifically designed for
unbounded data streams. Our model introduces stream-first concepts, such as
configurable windowing mechanisms, dynamic constraint adaptation, and
continuous assessment that produces quality meta-streams for real-time pipeline
awareness. To demonstrate practical applicability, we developed Stream DaQ, an
open-source Python framework that implements our theoretical model. Stream DaQ
unifies and adapts over 30 quality checks fragmented across existing static
tools into a comprehensive streaming suite, enabling practitioners to define
sophisticated, context-aware quality constraints through compositional
expressiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates that the model's implementation
significantly outperforms a production-grade alternative in both execution time
and throughput while offering richer functionality via native streaming
capabilities compared to other choices. Through its Python-native design,
Stream DaQ seamlessly integrates with modern data science workflows, making
continuous quality monitoring accessible to the broader data science community.

TL;DR: 本文研究了分布式推理的优化，发现其在预填充密集型任务和大模型中效果最佳，并强调了动态速率匹配和弹性扩展的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理扩展到多节点部署，分布式推理为提高吞吐量-交互性边界提供了潜力，但实际部署仍受限于复杂的优化搜索空间和系统协调。

Method: 通过系统研究，评估了数十万个设计点，涵盖多样化工作负载和硬件配置。

Result: 分布式推理在预填充密集型流量模式和大模型中效果最佳，动态速率匹配和弹性扩展对实现Pareto最优性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究结果为高效分布式部署提供了实用建议，帮助权衡系统吞吐量与交互性。

Abstract: As inference scales to multi-node deployments, disaggregation - splitting
inference into distinct phases - offers a promising path to improving the
throughput-interactivity Pareto frontier. Despite growing enthusiasm and a
surge of open-source efforts, practical deployment of disaggregated serving
remains limited due to the complexity of the optimization search space and
system-level coordination. In this paper, we present the first systematic study
of disaggregated inference at scale, evaluating hundreds of thousands of design
points across diverse workloads and hardware configurations. We find that
disaggregation is most effective for prefill-heavy traffic patterns and larger
models. Our results highlight the critical role of dynamic rate matching and
elastic scaling in achieving Pareto-optimal performance. Our findings offer
actionable insights for efficient disaggregated deployments to navigate the
trade-off between system throughput and interactivity.

### [4] [Resilient Auto-Scaling of Microservice Architectures with Efficient Resource Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05693)
*Hussain Ahmad,Christoph Treude,Markus Wagner,Claudia Szabo*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SecureSmart HPA 是一种改进的水平 Pod 自动扩展器，通过动态调整资源分配和资源共享，解决传统 HPA 在资源中断时的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 HPA 无法应对故障、网络攻击等资源中断问题，导致资源浪费和服务不可用。

Method: SecureSmart HPA 监控资源需求、检测中断、评估浪费，并动态调整扩展决策，同时支持资源共享。

Result: 实验表明，SecureSmart HPA 在资源中断情况下表现优异，减少 CPU 过载 57.2%，资源分配提高 51.1%。

Conclusion: SecureSmart HPA 在资源受限和波动环境中提供弹性和高效的自动扩展。

Abstract: Horizontal Pod Auto-scalers (HPAs) are crucial for managing resource
allocation in microservice architectures to handle fluctuating workloads.
However, traditional HPAs fail to address resource disruptions caused by
faults, cyberattacks, maintenance, and other operational challenges. These
disruptions result in resource wastage, service unavailability, and HPA
performance degradation. To address these challenges, we extend our prior work
on Smart HPA and propose SecureSmart HPA, which offers resilient and
resource-efficient auto-scaling for microservice architectures. SecureSmart HPA
monitors microservice resource demands, detects disruptions, evaluates resource
wastage, and dynamically adjusts scaling decisions to enhance the resilience of
auto-scaling operations. Furthermore, SecureSmart HPA enables resource sharing
among microservices, optimizing scaling efficiency in resource-constrained
environments. Experimental evaluation at varying disruption severities, with
25%, 50%, and 75% resource wastage, demonstrates that SecureSmart HPA performs
effectively across different levels of disruptions. It achieves up to a 57.2%
reduction in CPU overutilization and a 51.1% increase in resource allocation
compared to Smart HPA, highlighting its ability to deliver resilient and
efficient auto-scaling operations in volatile and resource-constrained
environments.

### [5] [Malicious node aware wireless multi hop networks: a systematic review of the literature and recommendations for future research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05742)
*Shahram Pourdehghan,Nahideh Derakhshanfard*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文综述了无线多跳网络中恶意节点的检测方法，分类比较了不同网络类型（如MANET、WSN等）中的现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线多跳网络因缺乏集中管理易受恶意节点影响，导致性能下降，需研究检测方法以提高网络可靠性。

Method: 分类比较文献中提出的恶意节点检测技术，涵盖多种无线网络类型。

Result: 总结了不同网络类型中恶意节点检测方法的优缺点。

Conclusion: 恶意节点检测对提升无线多跳网络性能至关重要，未来需进一步优化现有技术。

Abstract: Wireless communication provides great advantages that are not available
through their wired counterparts such as flexibility, ease of deployment and
use, cost reductions, and convenience. Wireless multi-hop networks (WMN) do not
have any centralized management infrastructure. Wireless multi-hop networks
have many benefits since proposed. In such networks when a node wants to send a
packet to a destination where is not in the transmission range, depend on some
intermediate nodes. In this type of networks packet sending is in the form of
multiple hop until destination and this work is dynamic. Lack of centralized
management cause that some nodes show malicious function. Malicious nodes are
that receive packets and drop them maliciously. These malicious nodes could
have many reasons such as hardware failure, software failure or lack of power.
Such nodes make multiple packets drop from the network and the performance of
network strongly decreases. As a result, the throughput of the network
decrease, increase end-to-end delay and increase overhead. Therefore, we must
aware from presence of malicious node in the network and do routing based on
this awareness. Therefore, this paper aims to study and review the present
malicious node detection methods that proposed in literatures. We categorized
networks in groups, including ad hoc networks, MANET, DTN, Opportunistic
networks, WSN, VANET and other wireless networks and compare malicious node
detection met

### [6] [Perfect Matching with Few Link Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06102)
*Hugo Mirault,Peter Robinson,Ming Ming Tan,Xianbin Zhu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文研究了在同步分布式网络中计算完美匹配的问题，重点分析了不同通信模型下的算法性能，包括随机算法和确定性算法的复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索在通信受限的分布式网络中如何高效解决完美匹配问题，特别是在节点无法直接发送消息的情况下。

Method: 提出了随机算法和确定性算法，分别在不同的假设下（如端口编号模型和KT_1假设）优化了轮数和脉冲复杂度。

Result: 随机算法在端口编号模型下达到O(log n)轮数和O(n log n)脉冲复杂度；确定性算法在KT_1假设下进一步优化为O(log n)时间和O(n)脉冲复杂度。

Conclusion: 研究表明随机性在端口编号模型中至关重要，而KT_1假设显著提升了确定性算法的性能，为分布式网络中的匹配问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing a perfect matching problem in a
synchronous distributed network, where the network topology corresponds to a
complete bipartite graph. The communication between nodes is restricted to
activating communication links, which means that instead of sending messages
containing a number of bits, each node can only send a pulse over some of its
incident links in each round. In the port numbering model, where nodes are
unaware of their neighbor's IDs, we give a randomized algorithm that terminates
in $O( \log n )$ rounds and has a pulse complexity of $O( n\log n )$, which
corresponds to the number of pulses sent over all links. We also show that
randomness is crucial in the port numbering model, as any deterministic
algorithm must send at least $\Omega( n^2 )$ messages in the standard LOCAL
model, where the messages can be of unbounded size. Then, we turn our attention
to the KT_1 assumption, where each node starts out knowing its neighbors' IDs.
We show that this additional knowledge enables significantly improved bounds
even for deterministic algorithms. First, we give an $O( \log n )$ time
deterministic algorithm that sends only $O( n )$ pulses. Finally, we apply this
algorithm recursively to obtain an exponential reduction in the time complexity
to $O( \log^*n\log\log n )$, while slightly increasing the pulse complexity to
$O( n\log^*n )$. All our bounds also hold in the standard CONGEST model with
single-bit messages.

### [7] [Learning-Augmented Hierarchical Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05495)
*Vladimir Braverman,Jon C. Ergun,Chen Wang,Samson Zhou*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用分裂预言机辅助的分层聚类方法，克服了传统HC目标难以近似的问题，并提供了多项式时间和近线性时间的近似算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分层聚类目标存在近似算法的硬性障碍，因此研究如何利用辅助信息（如分裂预言机）来克服这些限制。

Method: 使用分裂预言机，设计多项式时间和近线性时间的算法，分别近似Dasgupta和Moseley-Wang目标。

Result: 算法在多项式时间内实现O(1)-近似Dasgupta目标，近线性时间内实现(1-o(1))-近似Moseley-Wang目标。

Conclusion: 分裂预言机使算法超越传统HC方法的限制，并在子线性场景中扩展应用。

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering (HC) is an important data analysis technique in which
the goal is to recursively partition a dataset into a tree-like structure while
grouping together similar data points at each level of granularity.
Unfortunately, for many of the proposed HC objectives, there exist strong
barriers to approximation algorithms with the hardness of approximation. Thus,
we consider the problem of hierarchical clustering given auxiliary information
from natural oracles. Specifically, we focus on a *splitting oracle* which,
when provided with a triplet of vertices $(u,v,w)$, answers (possibly
erroneously) the pairs of vertices whose lowest common ancestor includes all
three vertices in an optimal tree, i.e., identifying which vertex ``splits
away'' from the others. Using such an oracle, we obtain the following results:
  - A polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree
with $O(1)$-approximation to the Dasgupta objective (Dasgupta [STOC'16]).
  - A near-linear time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree
with $(1-o(1))$-approximation to the Moseley-Wang objective (Moseley and Wang
[NeurIPS'17]).
  Under the plausible Small Set Expansion Hypothesis, no polynomial-time
algorithm can achieve any constant approximation for Dasgupta's objective or
$(1-C)$-approximation for the Moseley-Wang objective for some constant $C>0$.
As such, our results demonstrate that the splitting oracle enables algorithms
to outperform standard HC approaches and overcome hardness constraints.
Furthermore, our approaches extend to sublinear settings, in which we show new
streaming and PRAM algorithms for HC with improved guarantees.

### [8] [On Differential Privacy for Adaptively Solving Search Problems via Sketching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05503)
*Shiyuan Feng,Ying Feng,George Z. Li,Zhao Song,David P. Woodruff,Lichen Zhang*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文探讨了差分隐私在搜索问题中的应用，解决了传统方法仅适用于数值估计问题的局限性，提出了针对最近邻查询和回归问题的隐私保护算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统差分隐私方法仅适用于数值估计问题，无法直接返回搜索问题的解。本文旨在解决这一局限性，探索差分隐私在搜索问题中的适应性查询。

Method: 针对最近邻查询和回归问题，识别关键参数（如近似近邻数量和矩阵条件数），并利用差分隐私技术设计算法，返回解向量。

Result: 提出了针对两种搜索问题的算法，实现了内存和时间与关键参数相关的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究表明，差分隐私可以有效地应用于搜索问题，为适应性查询提供隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Recently differential privacy has been used for a number of streaming, data
structure, and dynamic graph problems as a means of hiding the internal
randomness of the data structure, so that multiple possibly adaptive queries
can be made without sacrificing the correctness of the responses. Although
these works use differential privacy to show that for some problems it is
possible to tolerate $T$ queries using $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ copies of a
data structure, such results only apply to numerical estimation problems, and
only return the cost of an optimization problem rather than the solution
itself. In this paper, we investigate the use of differential privacy for
adaptive queries to search problems, which are significantly more challenging
since the responses to queries can reveal much more about the internal
randomness than a single numerical query. We focus on two classical search
problems: nearest neighbor queries and regression with arbitrary turnstile
updates. We identify key parameters to these problems, such as the number of
$c$-approximate near neighbors and the matrix condition number, and use
different differential privacy techniques to design algorithms returning the
solution vector with memory and time depending on these parameters. We give
algorithms for each of these problems that achieve similar tradeoffs.

*Aaron Schild,Sreenivas Gollapudi,Anupam Gupta,Kostas Kollias,Ali Sinop*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文提出了简单有效解释（SVE）的概念，用于解释动态交通条件下路由服务为何推荐特定路线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户常对路由服务推荐的路线产生疑问，尤其是在动态交通条件下。研究旨在提供一种解释方法，帮助用户理解推荐路线的合理性。

Method: 引入SVE概念，设计高效算法，通过少量交通拥堵路段解释最短交通感知路线与最短无交通路线之间的差异。

Result: 理论和实验证明，SVE能提供小而可解释的答案。

Conclusion: SVE为路由服务提供了一种有效的解释工具，帮助用户理解动态交通条件下的路线选择。

Abstract: Users of routing services like Apple Maps, Google Maps, and Waze frequently
wonder why a given route is proposed. This question particularly arises when
dynamic conditions like traffic and road closures cause unusual routes to be
proposed. While many dynamic conditions may exist in a road network at any
time, only a small fraction of those conditions are typically relevant to a
given user's route. In this work, we introduce the concept of a simple valid
explanation (SVE), which consists of a small set of traffic-laden road segments
that answer the following question: Which traffic conditions cause a particular
shortest traffic-aware route to differ from the shortest traffic-free route? We
give an efficient algorithm for finding SVEs and show that they theoretically
and experimentally lead to small and interpretable answers to the question.

*Negin Golrezaei,Sourav Sahoo*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 研究重复统一价格多单位拍卖中的投标问题，提出一种满足每轮投资回报率（RoI）约束的安全投标策略，并开发多项式时间算法学习最优策略，实现次线性遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决投标者在多轮拍卖中如何最大化累积价值同时满足每轮RoI约束的问题。

Method: 引入m-uniform投标格式和安全投标策略，提出多项式时间算法学习最优策略。

Result: 安全策略在实践中表现优于理论界限，算法能实现α-近似次线性遗憾。

Conclusion: 安全投标策略在多轮拍卖中具有实际吸引力，算法高效且性能优越。

Abstract: We study the bidding problem in repeated uniform price multi-unit auctions
from the perspective of a single value-maximizing buyer who aims to maximize
their cumulative value over $T$ rounds while adhering to return-on-investment
(RoI) constraints in each round. Buyers adopt $m$-uniform bidding format, where
they submit $m$ bid-quantity pairs $(b_i, q_i)$ to demand $q_i$ units at bid
$b_i$. We introduce safe bidding strategies as those that satisfy RoI
constraints in every auction, regardless of competing bids. We show that these
strategies depend only on the valuation curve of the bidder, and the bidder can
focus on a finite subset of this class without loss of generality. While the
number of strategies in this subset is exponential in $m$, we develop a
polynomial-time algorithm to learn the optimal safe strategy that achieves
sublinear regret in the online setting, where regret is measured against a
clairvoyant benchmark that knows the competing bids a priori and selects a
fixed hindsight optimal safe strategy. We then evaluate the performance of safe
strategies against a clairvoyant that selects the optimal strategy from a
richer class of strategies in the online setting. In this scenario, we compute
the richness ratio, $\alpha\in(0, 1]$ for the class of strategies chosen by the
clairvoyant and show that our algorithm, designed to learn safe strategies,
achieves $\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret against these stronger
benchmarks. Experiments on semi-synthetic data from real-world auctions show
that safe strategies substantially outperform the derived theoretical bounds,
making them quite appealing in practice.

Abstract: This survey investigates how classical software design patterns can enhance
the reliability and scalability of communication in Large Language Model
(LLM)-driven agentic AI systems, focusing particularly on the Model Context
Protocol (MCP). It examines the foundational architectures of LLM-based agents
and their evolution from isolated operation to sophisticated, multi-agent
collaboration, addressing key communication hurdles that arise in this
transition. The study revisits well-established patterns, including Mediator,
Observer, Publish-Subscribe, and Broker, and analyzes their relevance in
structuring agent interactions within MCP-compliant frameworks. To clarify
these dynamics, the article provides conceptual schematics and formal models
that map out communication pathways and optimize data flow. It further explores
architectural variations suited to different degrees of agent autonomy and
system complexity. Real-world applications in domains such as real-time
financial processing and investment banking are discussed, illustrating how
these patterns and MCP can meet specific operational demands. The article
concludes by outlining open challenges, potential security risks, and promising
directions for advancing robust, interoperable, and scalable multi-agent LLM
ecosystems.

mitigating their unsafe behaviors is critical. Interpretation techniques can
reveal causes of unsafe outputs and guide safety, but such connections with
safety are often overlooked in prior surveys. We present the first survey that

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对提示工程技术在软件工程任务上的系统性评估，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 使用四种大型语言模型，评估14种提示技术在10个软件工程任务上的表现，涵盖六种核心维度。

Result: 结果显示，复杂逻辑任务和上下文理解任务需要不同的提示技术，并分析了语言特征与效果的相关性。

Conclusion: 研究为实践者提供了选择最佳提示技术的指导，并报告了时间和令牌消耗。

Abstract: A growing variety of prompt engineering techniques has been proposed for
Large Language Models (LLMs), yet systematic evaluation of each technique on
individual software engineering (SE) tasks remains underexplored. In this
study, we present a systematic evaluation of 14 established prompt techniques
across 10 SE tasks using four LLM models. As identified in the prior
literature, the selected prompting techniques span six core dimensions
(Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Thought Generation, Ensembling, Self-Criticism, and
Decomposition). They are evaluated on tasks such as code generation, bug
fixing, and code-oriented question answering, to name a few. Our results show
which prompting techniques are most effective for SE tasks requiring complex
logic and intensive reasoning versus those that rely more on contextual
understanding and example-driven scenarios. We also analyze correlations
between the linguistic characteristics of prompts and the factors that
contribute to the effectiveness of prompting techniques in enhancing
performance on SE tasks. Additionally, we report the time and token consumption
for each prompting technique when applied to a specific task and model,
offering guidance for practitioners in selecting the optimal prompting
technique for their use cases.

Motivation: 当前IaC生成研究仅关注语法正确性，忽略了可部署性这一关键指标，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出IaCGen框架（基于LLM的迭代反馈机制）和DPIaC-Eval基准（包含153个真实场景）。

Result: 初始LLM部署成功率低（Claude-3.5为30.2%），但IaCGen将其提升至98%。用户意图对齐（25.2%）和安全性（8.4%）仍是挑战。

Conclusion: 论文首次全面评估可部署性为中心的IaC生成，为未来研究奠定基础，但用户意图和安全性需进一步研究。

Abstract: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) generation holds significant promise for
automating cloud infrastructure provisioning. Recent advances in Large Language
Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by
generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language
descriptions, but current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while
ignoring deployability, the fatal measure of IaC template utility. We address
this gap through two contributions: (1) IaCGen, an LLM-based
deployability-centric framework that uses iterative feedback mechanism to
generate IaC templates, and (2) DPIaC-Eval, a deployability-centric IaC
template benchmark consists of 153 real-world scenarios that can evaluate
syntax, deployment, user intent, and security. Our evaluation reveals that
state-of-the-art LLMs initially performed poorly, with Claude-3.5 and
Claude-3.7 achieving only 30.2% and 26.8% deployment success on the first
attempt respectively. However, IaCGen transforms this performance dramatically:
all evaluated models reach over 90% passItr@25, with Claude-3.5 and Claude-3.7
achieving 98% success rate. Despite these improvements, critical challenges
remain in user intent alignment (25.2% accuracy) and security compliance (8.4%
pass rate), highlighting areas requiring continued research. Our work provides
the first comprehensive assessment of deployability-centric IaC template
generation and establishes a foundation for future research.

Motivation: 编程竞赛的测试用例难以获取，而测试用例质量直接影响评估准确性，因此需要生成高质量测试用例。

Method: 采用基于LLM的代理系统生成测试用例，应用于CodeContests数据集，构建改进版CodeContests+。

Result: CodeContests+在评估准确性上显著优于原数据集，尤其在真阳性率（TPR）上表现突出，且测试用例质量的提升对强化学习（RL）有明显优势。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的测试用例生成方法有效提升了数据集质量，为编程竞赛和LLM评估提供了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: Competitive programming, due to its high reasoning difficulty and precise
correctness feedback, has become a key task for both training and evaluating
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, while a
large amount of public problem data, such as problem statements and solutions,
is available, the test cases of these problems are often difficult to obtain.
Therefore, test case generation is a necessary task for building large-scale
datasets, and the quality of the test cases directly determines the accuracy of
the evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based agent system that
creates high-quality test cases for competitive programming problems. We apply
this system to the CodeContests dataset and propose a new version with improved
test cases, named CodeContests+. We evaluated the quality of test cases in
CodeContestsPlus. First, we used 1.72 million submissions with pass/fail labels
to examine the accuracy of these test cases in evaluation. The results
indicated that CodeContests+ achieves significantly higher accuracy than
CodeContests, particularly with a notably higher True Positive Rate (TPR).
Subsequently, our experiments in LLM Reinforcement Learning (RL) further
confirmed that improvements in test case quality yield considerable advantages
for RL.

Abstract: Centralized electrical/electronic architectures and High-Performance
Computers (HPCs) are redefining automotive software development, challenging
traditional microcontroller-based approaches. Ensuring real-time, safety, and
scalability in software-defined vehicles necessitates reevaluating how
mixed-criticality software is integrated into centralized architectures. While
existing research on automotive SoftWare Architectures (SWAs) is relevant to
the industry, it often lacks validation through systematic, empirical methods.
To address this gap, we conduct a systematic literature review focusing on
automotive mixed-criticality SWAs. Our goal is to provide practitioner-oriented
guidelines that assist automotive software architects and developers design
centralized, mixed-criticality SWAs based on a rigorous and transparent
methodology. First, we set up a systematic review protocol grounded in
established guidelines. Second, we apply this protocol to identify relevant
studies. Third, we extract key functional domains, constraints, and enabling
technologies that drive changes in automotive SWAs, thereby assessing the
protocol's effectiveness. Additionally, we extract techniques, architectural
patterns, and design practices for integrating mixed-criticality requirements
into HPC-based SWAs, further demonstrating the protocol's applicability. Based
on these insights, we propose an exemplary SWA for a microprocessor-based
system-on-chip. In conclusion, this study provides a structured approach to
explore and realize mixed-criticality software integration for next-generation
automotive SWAs, offering valuable insights for industry and research
applications.

Abstract: Competitive programming contests play a crucial role in cultivating
computational thinking and algorithmic skills among learners. However,
generating comprehensive test cases to effectively assess programming solutions
remains resource-intensive and challenging for educators. This paper introduces
an innovative NLP-driven method leveraging generative AI (large language

5th graders, recent competitions hosted on the Kilonova.ro platform, and the
International Informatics Olympiad in Teams (IIOT). Our results demonstrate
that AI-generated test cases substantially enhanced assessments, notably
identifying previously undetected errors in 67% of the OJI 5th grade
programming problems. These improvements underscore the complementary
educational value of our technique in formative assessment contexts. By openly
sharing our prompts, translated datasets, and methodologies, we offer practical
NLP-based tools that educators and contest organizers can readily integrate to
enhance assessment quality, reduce workload, and deepen insights into learner
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 污点分析在漏洞发现中强大，但面临外部库调用建模需大量手动标注和全程序图表示的性能问题。

Method: 设计并实现了一个系统，通过过度近似数据流处理缺失标注，支持后续标注添加而无需重新计算。

Result: 该系统已贡献给开源代码分析平台Joern，供社区使用。

Conclusion: 该系统解决了污点分析中的标注和性能挑战，提升了实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Taint analysis using explicit whole-program data-dependence graphs is
powerful for vulnerability discovery but faces two major challenges. First,
accurately modeling taint propagation through calls to external library
procedures requires extensive manual annotations, which becomes impractical for
large ecosystems. Second, the sheer size of whole-program graph representations
leads to serious scalability and performance issues, particularly when quick
analysis is needed in continuous development pipelines.
  This paper presents the design and implementation of a system for a
language-agnostic data-dependence representation. The system accommodates
missing annotations describing the behavior of library procedures by
over-approximating data flows, allowing annotations to be added later without
recalculation. We contribute this data-flow analysis system to the open-source
code analysis platform Joern making it available to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前端UI代码生成基准存在局限性，如未纳入主流开发框架、仅关注代码生成任务、缺乏多维评估等。

Method: 引入DesignBench，涵盖React、Vue、Angular和HTML/CSS，评估生成、编辑和修复任务，包含900个网页样本。

Result: 系统评估揭示了MLLMs在框架特定限制、任务瓶颈和不同条件下的性能变化。

Conclusion: DesignBench为未来自动化前端开发研究提供了指导，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in automated front-end engineering, e.g., generating UI code from
visual designs. However, existing front-end UI code generation benchmarks have
the following limitations: (1) While framework-based development becomes
predominant in modern front-end programming, current benchmarks fail to
incorporate mainstream development frameworks. (2) Existing evaluations focus
solely on the UI code generation task, whereas practical UI development
involves several iterations, including refining editing, and repairing issues.
(3) Current benchmarks employ unidimensional evaluation, lacking investigation
into influencing factors like task difficulty, input context variations, and
in-depth code-level analysis. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DesignBench, a
multi-framework, multi-task evaluation benchmark for assessing MLLMs'
capabilities in automated front-end engineering. DesignBench encompasses three
widely-used UI frameworks (React, Vue, and Angular) alongside vanilla HTML/CSS,
and evaluates on three essential front-end tasks (generation, edit, and repair)
in real-world development workflows. DesignBench contains 900 webpage samples
spanning over 11 topics, 9 edit types, and 6 issue categories, enabling
detailed analysis of MLLM performance across multiple dimensions. Our
systematic evaluation reveals critical insights into MLLMs' framework-specific
limitations, task-related bottlenecks, and performance variations under
different conditions, providing guidance for future research in automated
front-end development. Our code and data are available at

Motivation: ICRL面临状态-动作-奖励数据的多模态性和任务多样性的挑战，需要一种更有效的框架来适应不同任务。

Method: T2MIR采用token-wise MoE和task-wise MoE层，结合对比学习优化任务路由，增强任务相关信息的捕捉。

Result: 实验表明T2MIR显著优于基线方法，提升了ICRL的性能。

Conclusion: T2MIR为ICRL提供了一种简单且可扩展的架构改进，推动了其在语言和视觉领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for adapting RL agents to downstream tasks through prompt conditioning.
However, two notable challenges remain in fully harnessing in-context learning
within RL domains: the intrinsic multi-modality of the state-action-reward data
and the diverse, heterogeneous nature of decision tasks. To tackle these
challenges, we propose \textbf{T2MIR} (\textbf{T}oken- and \textbf{T}ask-wise
\textbf{M}oE for \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{R}L), an innovative framework that
introduces architectural advances of mixture-of-experts (MoE) into
transformer-based decision models. T2MIR substitutes the feedforward layer with
two parallel layers: a token-wise MoE that captures distinct semantics of input
tokens across multiple modalities, and a task-wise MoE that routes diverse
tasks to specialized experts for managing a broad task distribution with
alleviated gradient conflicts. To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a
contrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the
task and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of
task-relevant information. The outputs of two MoE components are concatenated
and fed into the next layer. Comprehensive experiments show that T2MIR
significantly facilitates in-context learning capacity and outperforms various
types of baselines. We bring the potential and promise of MoE to ICRL, offering
a simple and scalable architectural enhancement to advance ICRL one step closer
toward achievements in language and vision communities. Our code is available

Result: 在30个代表性数据集上，MTPNet平均RMSE提升了18.95%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTPNet通过条件深度学习内化交互模式，加速化合物优化与设计。

Abstract: Activity cliff prediction is a critical task in drug discovery and material
design. Existing computational methods are limited to handling single binding
targets, which restricts the applicability of these prediction models. In this
paper, we present the Multi-Grained Target Perception network (MTPNet) to
incorporate the prior knowledge of interactions between the molecules and their
target proteins. Specifically, MTPNet is a unified framework for activity cliff
prediction, which consists of two components: Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS)
guidance and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance. By this way, MTPNet
dynamically optimizes molecular representations through multi-grained protein
semantic conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first time to employ the
receptor proteins as guiding information to effectively capture critical
interaction details. Extensive experiments on 30 representative activity cliff
datasets demonstrate that MTPNet significantly outperforms previous approaches,
achieving an average RMSE improvement of 18.95% on top of several mainstream
GNN architectures. Overall, MTPNet internalizes interaction patterns through
conditional deep learning to achieve unified predictions of activity cliffs,
helping to accelerate compound optimization and design. Codes are available at:

TL;DR: MCI-Diff是一种基于扩散的框架，通过合成未来sMRI图像，实现实时风险评估和高预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期预测轻度认知障碍（MCI）转化面临即时性与准确性的权衡，MCI-Diff旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用多任务序列重建策略和LLM驱动的“语言指南”技术，生成临床可信的未来sMRI图像。

Result: 在ADNI和AIBL数据集上，MCI-Diff比现有方法提升5-12%的早期转化预测准确率。

Conclusion: MCI-Diff在即时性和准确性上均表现优异，为MCI早期预测提供了新方法。

Abstract: Early prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) conversion is hampered by
a trade-off between immediacy--making fast predictions from a single baseline
sMRI--and accuracy--leveraging longitudinal scans to capture disease
progression. We propose MCI-Diff, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes
clinically plausible future sMRI representations directly from baseline data,
achieving both real-time risk assessment and high predictive performance.
First, a multi-task sequence reconstruction strategy trains a shared denoising
network on interpolation and extrapolation tasks to handle irregular follow-up
sampling and learn robust latent trajectories. Second, an LLM-driven
"linguistic compass" is introduced for clinical plausibility sampling:
generated feature candidates are quantized, tokenized, and scored by a
fine-tuned language model conditioned on expected structural biomarkers,
guiding autoregressive generation toward realistic disease patterns.
Experiments on ADNI and AIBL cohorts show that MCI-Diff outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, improving early conversion accuracy by 5-12%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量量化方法在方向量化上表现较差，导致LLM在边缘部署时准确率下降明显。

Method: 1) 极坐标解耦（PCD）独立量化向量的方向和大小；2) 分布对齐码本构建（DACC）优化码本。

Result: PCDVQ在2-bit量化下零样本准确率至少提升1.5%。

Conclusion: PCDVQ为高压缩LLM提供了一种新范式，显著提升量化效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in edge deployment
due to their massive parameter scale. Vector Quantization (VQ), a
clustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this
issue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.
Since a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction
and magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.
However, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to
quantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately
clustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the
accuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\% and 2.3\%, respectively. This gap
even increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean
distance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works,
places greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is
contrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization
errors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector
Quantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two
key modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors
into their polar coordinate representations and perform independent
quantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned
Codebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude
codebooks in accordance with the source distribution. Experimental results show
that PCDVQ outperforms baseline methods at 2-bit level by at least 1.5\%
zero-shot accuracy, establishing a novel paradigm for accurate and highly
compressed LLMs.

Method: 提出了一种方法，通过在线学习和查询启发式算法的动作，克服无法直接估计成本的困难。

Result: 实现了$O(\text{OPT}^{2/3})$的遗憾值，并证明了基于Dekel等人构造的紧下界。

Conclusion: 该方法在MTS中有效实现了与最佳启发式算法相当的性能，并提供了理论上的紧下界支持。

Abstract: We consider the following problem: We are given $\ell$ heuristics for
Metrical Task Systems (MTS), where each might be tailored to a different type
of input instances. While processing an input instance received online, we are
allowed to query the action of only one of the heuristics at each time step.
Our goal is to achieve performance comparable to the best of the given
heuristics. The main difficulty of our setting comes from the fact that the
cost paid by a heuristic at time $t$ cannot be estimated unless the same
heuristic was also queried at time $t-1$. This is related to Bandit Learning
against memory bounded adversaries (Arora et al., 2012). We show how to achieve
regret of $O(\text{OPT}^{2/3})$ and prove a tight lower bound based on the
construction of Dekel et al. (2013).

TL;DR: Prefix Grouper是一种高效的GRPO训练算法，通过共享前缀计算减少冗余，提升长上下文学习场景下的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在长共享前缀场景下存在计算冗余问题，成为扩展性的瓶颈。

Method: 提出Shared-Prefix Forward策略，将自注意力分为两部分，共享前缀仅编码一次，同时保持端到端训练的可微性和兼容性。

Result: 理论和实验证明Prefix Grouper与标准GRPO训练等效，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Prefix Grouper可无缝集成现有GRPO架构，提升扩展性，适用于更复杂任务和更大模型。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhances policy learning by
computing gradients from relative comparisons among candidate outputs that
share a common input prefix. Despite its effectiveness, GRPO introduces
substantial computational overhead when processing long shared prefixes, which
must be redundantly encoded for each group member. This inefficiency becomes a
major scalability bottleneck in long-context learning scenarios. We propose
Prefix Grouper, an efficient GRPO training algorithm that eliminates redundant
prefix computation via a Shared-Prefix Forward strategy. In particular, by
restructuring self-attention into two parts, our method enables the shared
prefix to be encoded only once, while preserving full differentiability and
compatibility with end-to-end training. We provide both theoretical and
empirical evidence that Prefix Grouper is training-equivalent to standard GRPO:
it yields identical forward outputs and backward gradients, ensuring that the
optimization dynamics and final policy performance remain unchanged.
Empirically, our experiments confirm that Prefix Grouper achieves consistent
results while significantly reducing the computational cost of training,
particularly in long-prefix scenarios. The proposed method is fully
plug-and-play: it is compatible with existing GRPO-based architectures and can
be seamlessly integrated into current training pipelines as a drop-in
replacement, requiring no structural modifications and only minimal changes to
input construction and attention computation. Prefix Grouper enables the use of
larger group sizes under the same computational budget, thereby improving the
scalability of GRPO to more complex tasks and larger models. Code is now

Result: 在ImageNet等场景中，lip-rcp在鲁棒CP集大小和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: lip-rcp方法不仅高效，还能提供鲁棒性保证，同时改进了经典CP在对抗攻击下的覆盖范围。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has proven to be an effective post-hoc method for
improving the trustworthiness of neural networks by providing prediction sets
with finite-sample guarantees. However, under adversarial attacks, classical
conformal guarantees do not hold anymore: this problem is addressed in the
field of Robust Conformal Prediction. Several methods have been proposed to
provide robust CP sets with guarantees under adversarial perturbations, but,
for large scale problems, these sets are either too large or the methods are
too computationally demanding to be deployed in real life scenarios. In this
work, we propose a new method that leverages Lipschitz-bounded networks to
precisely and efficiently estimate robust CP sets. When combined with a
1-Lipschitz robust network, we demonstrate that our lip-rcp method outperforms
state-of-the-art results in both the size of the robust CP sets and
computational efficiency in medium and large-scale scenarios such as ImageNet.
Taking a different angle, we also study vanilla CP under attack, and derive new
worst-case coverage bounds of vanilla CP sets, which are valid simultaneously
for all adversarial attack levels. Our lip-rcp method makes this second
approach as efficient as vanilla CP while also allowing robustness guarantees.

optimal strategy in minutes on a single standard CPU, eliminating the need for
costly benchmarking, while achieving predictions within a $20\%$ error margin.
It appeals to be practical for rapid deployment planning because of its

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现包装状态监测，兼顾精度与低功耗，适用于工业场景。

Abstract: Package monitoring is an important topic in industrial applications, with
significant implications for operational efficiency and ecological
sustainability. In this study, we propose an approach that employs an embedded
system, placed on reusable packages, to detect their state (on a Forklift, in a
Truck, or in an undetermined location). We aim to design a system with a
lifespan of several years, corresponding to the lifespan of reusable packages.
Our analysis demonstrates that maximizing device lifespan requires minimizing
wake time. We propose a pipeline that includes data processing, training, and
evaluation of the deep learning model designed for imbalanced, multiclass time
series data collected from an embedded sensor. The method uses a
one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network architecture to classify
accelerometer data from the IoT device. Before training, two data augmentation
techniques are tested to solve the imbalance problem of the dataset: the
Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique and the ADAptive SYNthetic sampling
approach. After training, compression techniques are implemented to have a
small model size. On the considered twoclass problem, the methodology yields a
precision of 94.54% for the first class and 95.83% for the second class, while
compression techniques reduce the model size by a factor of four. The trained
model is deployed on the IoT device, where it operates with a power consumption
of 316 mW during inference.

Result: FedBE在通用任务上准确率保留提高12-74%，收敛速度加快1.9-3.1倍。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FedFT) of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as
a promising solution for adapting models to distributed data environments while
ensuring data privacy.
  Existing FedFT methods predominantly utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques to reduce communication and computation overhead.
  However, they often fail to adequately address the catastrophic forgetting, a
critical challenge arising from continual adaptation in distributed
environments. The traditional centralized fine-tuning methods, which are not
designed for the heterogeneous and privacy-constrained nature of federated
environments, struggle to mitigate this issue effectively. Moreover, the
challenge is further exacerbated by significant variation in data distributions
and device capabilities across clients, which leads to intensified forgetting
and degraded model generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose FedBE, a
novel FedFT framework that integrates an adaptive transformer block expansion
mechanism with a dynamic trainable-block allocation strategy. Specifically,
FedBE expands trainable blocks within the model architecture, structurally
separating newly learned task-specific knowledge from the original pre-trained
representations. Additionally, FedBE dynamically assigns these trainable blocks
to clients based on their data distributions and computational capabilities.
This enables the framework to better accommodate heterogeneous federated
environments and enhances the generalization ability of the model.Extensive
experiments show that compared with existing federated fine-tuning methods,
FedBE achieves 12-74% higher accuracy retention on general tasks after
fine-tuning and a model convergence acceleration ratio of 1.9-3.1x without
degrading the accuracy of downstream tasks.

Result: 在两个轴承生命周期数据集上，该方法优于对比方法，动态HI在预测任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的动态HI能有效捕获退化过程的动态内容，提升退化趋势建模和预测能力。

Abstract: Health indicator (HI) plays a key role in degradation assessment and
prognostics of rolling bearings. Although various HI construction methods have
been investigated, most of them rely on expert knowledge for feature extraction
and overlook capturing dynamic information hidden in sequential degradation
processes, which limits the ability of the constructed HI for degradation trend
representation and prognostics. To address these concerns, a novel dynamic HI
that considers HI-level temporal dependence is constructed through an
unsupervised framework. Specifically, a degradation feature learning module
composed of a skip-connection-based autoencoder first maps raw signals to a
representative degradation feature space (DFS) to automatically extract
essential degradation features without the need for expert knowledge.
Subsequently, in this DFS, a new HI-generating module embedded with an inner
HI-prediction block is proposed for dynamic HI construction, where the temporal
dependence between past and current HI states is guaranteed and modeled
explicitly. On this basis, the dynamic HI captures the inherent dynamic
contents of the degradation process, ensuring its effectiveness for degradation
tendency modeling and future degradation prognostics. The experiment results on
two bearing lifecycle datasets demonstrate that the proposed HI construction
method outperforms comparison methods, and the constructed dynamic HI is
superior for prognostic tasks.

Conclusion: UniPTMs通过创新的架构和特征融合方法，显著提升了PTM预测性能，同时平衡了模型复杂性和效率。

Abstract: As a core mechanism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotes, protein
post-translational modifications (PTMs) require precise prediction to decipher
dynamic life activity networks. To address the limitations of existing deep
learning models in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and
architectural optimization, this study proposes UniPTMs: the first unified
framework for multi-type PTM prediction. The framework innovatively establishes
a "Master-Slave" dual-path collaborative architecture: The master path
dynamically integrates high-dimensional representations of protein sequences,
structures, and evolutionary information through a Bidirectional Gated
Cross-Attention (BGCA) module, while the slave path optimizes feature
discrepancies and recalibration between structural and traditional features
using a Low-Dimensional Fusion Network (LDFN). Complemented by a Multi-scale
Adaptive convolutional Pyramid (MACP) for capturing local feature patterns and
a Bidirectional Hierarchical Gated Fusion Network (BHGFN) enabling multi-level
feature integration across paths, the framework employs a Hierarchical Dynamic
Weighting Fusion (HDWF) mechanism to intelligently aggregate multimodal
features. Enhanced by a novel Hierarchical Contrastive loss function for
feature consistency optimization, UniPTMs demonstrates significant performance
improvements (3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP increases) over state-of-the-art
models across five modification types and transcends the Single-Type Prediction
Paradigm. To strike a balance between model complexity and performance, we have
also developed a lightweight variant named UniPTMs-mini.

Motivation: 隐藏混淆变量会影响状态和动作，导致强化学习策略学习出现偏差，传统方法仅依赖统计关联而非因果效应。

Method: 提出DoSAC算法，结合后门准则估计干预策略，无需真实混淆变量或因果标签，通过可学习的后门重构器推断伪历史变量。

Conclusion: DoSAC通过因果干预有效解决了隐藏混淆问题，为强化学习中的策略学习提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Hidden confounders that influence both states and actions can bias policy
learning in reinforcement learning (RL), leading to suboptimal or
non-generalizable behavior. Most RL algorithms ignore this issue, learning
policies from observational trajectories based solely on statistical
associations rather than causal effects. We propose DoSAC (Do-Calculus Soft
Actor-Critic with Backdoor Adjustment), a principled extension of the SAC
algorithm that corrects for hidden confounding via causal intervention
estimation. DoSAC estimates the interventional policy $\pi(a | \mathrm{do}(s))$
using the backdoor criterion, without requiring access to true confounders or
causal labels. To achieve this, we introduce a learnable Backdoor Reconstructor
that infers pseudo-past variables (previous state and action) from the current
state to enable backdoor adjustment from observational data. This module is
integrated into a soft actor-critic framework to compute both the
interventional policy and its entropy. Empirical results on continuous control
benchmarks show that DoSAC outperforms baselines under confounded settings,
with improved robustness, generalization, and policy reliability.

Motivation: 探索规模扩展如何改善语言模型的训练动态，特别是损失减速现象。

Method: 分析语言模型的损失曲线，提出零和学习（ZSL）概念，解释损失减速的原因。

Result: 模型规模扩大可以降低损失减速发生的损失值，并改善减速后的损失改进速率。

Conclusion: 损失减速和ZSL为语言模型扩展规律提供了新见解，可能直接用于改进模型性能。

Abstract: This work aims to understand how scaling improves language models,
specifically in terms of training dynamics. We find that language models
undergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of
loss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in
log-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing
the loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of
loss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type
of degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL,
per-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive
interference in per-example changes in loss. As a result, improving loss on one
subset of examples degrades it on another, bottlenecking overall progress. Loss
deceleration and ZSL provide new insights into the training dynamics underlying
language model scaling laws, and could potentially be targeted directly to
improve language models independent of scale. We make our code and artefacts
available at: https://github.com/mirandrom/zsl

Motivation: 研究零阶优化方法在梯度不可行或计算昂贵时的应用，探索其隐含的正则化特性，以区分尖锐和平坦极小值。

Method: 使用标准两点估计器进行零阶优化，分析其对Hessian矩阵迹的影响，并推导收敛速率。

Result: 理论和实验表明，零阶优化倾向于选择平坦极小值，且在凸函数和语言模型微调任务中验证了这一点。

Conclusion: 零阶优化隐含地偏好平坦极小值，为相关应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Zeroth-order methods are extensively used in machine learning applications
where gradients are infeasible or expensive to compute, such as black-box
attacks, reinforcement learning, and language model fine-tuning. Existing
optimization theory focuses on convergence to an arbitrary stationary point,
but less is known on the implicit regularization that provides a fine-grained
characterization on which particular solutions are finally reached. We show
that zeroth-order optimization with the standard two-point estimator favors
solutions with small trace of Hessian, which is widely used in previous work to
distinguish between sharp and flat minima. We further provide convergence rates
of zeroth-order optimization to approximate flat minima for convex and
sufficiently smooth functions, where flat minima are defined as the minimizers
that achieve the smallest trace of Hessian among all optimal solutions.
Experiments on binary classification tasks with convex losses and language
model fine-tuning support our theoretical findings.

Result: 去归一化方法简化了工作流程，加速了收敛，并提高了反演精度，优于预训练方法。

Conclusion: 去归一化是更优的初始模型嵌入方法，适用于神经网络重参数化FWI。

Abstract: Subsurface property neural network reparameterized full waveform inversion
(FWI) has emerged as an effective unsupervised learning framework, which can
invert stably with an inaccurate starting model. It updates the trainable
neural network parameters instead of fine-tuning on the subsurface model
directly. There are primarily two ways to embed the prior knowledge of the
initial model into neural networks, that is, pretraining and denormalization.
Pretraining first regulates the neural networks' parameters by fitting the
initial velocity model; Denormalization directly adds the outputs of the
network into the initial models without pretraining. In this letter, we
systematically investigate the influence of the two ways of initial model
incorporation for the neural network reparameterized FWI. We demonstrate that
pretraining requires inverting the model perturbation based on a constant
velocity value (mean) with a two-stage implementation. It leads to a complex
workflow and inconsistency of objective functions in the two-stage process,
causing the network parameters to become inactive and lose plasticity.
Experimental results demonstrate that denormalization can simplify workflows,
accelerate convergence, and enhance inversion accuracy compared with
pretraining.

Result: 在三个真实世界任务和两个大语言模型上的实验表明，CPQ能生成比现有方法更信息丰富的预测集。

Conclusion: CPQ为黑盒生成模型的不确定性量化提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了预测集的信息量。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for safe deployment of
generative AI models such as large language models (LLMs), especially in high
stakes applications. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a principled uncertainty
quantification framework, but classical methods focus on regression and
classification, relying on geometric distances or softmax scores: tools that
presuppose structured outputs. We depart from this paradigm by studying CP in a
query only setting, where prediction sets must be constructed solely from
finite queries to a black box generative model, introducing a new trade off
between coverage, test time query budget, and informativeness. We introduce
Conformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ), a framework characterizing the
optimal interplay between these objectives. Our finite sample algorithm is
built on two core principles: one governs the optimal query policy, and the
other defines the optimal mapping from queried samples to prediction sets.
Remarkably, both are rooted in the classical missing mass problem in
statistics. Specifically, the optimal query policy depends on the rate of
decay, or the derivative, of the missing mass, for which we develop a novel
estimator. Meanwhile, the optimal mapping hinges on the missing mass itself,
which we estimate using Good Turing estimators. We then turn our focus to
implementing our method for language models, where outputs are vast, variable,
and often under specified. Fine grained experiments on three real world open
ended tasks and two LLMs, show CPQ applicability to any black box LLM and
highlight: (1) individual contribution of each principle to CPQ performance,
and (2) CPQ ability to yield significantly more informative prediction sets
than existing conformal methods for language uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: In this work we consider generic Gaussian Multi-index models, in which the
labels only depend on the (Gaussian) $d$-dimensional inputs through their
projection onto a low-dimensional $r = O_d(1)$ subspace, and we study efficient
agnostic estimation procedures for this hidden subspace. We introduce the
\emph{generative leap} exponent $k^\star$, a natural extension of the
generative exponent from [Damian et al.'24] to the multi-index setting. We
first show that a sample complexity of $n=\Theta(d^{1 \vee \k/2})$ is necessary
in the class of algorithms captured by the Low-Degree-Polynomial framework. We
then establish that this sample complexity is also sufficient, by giving an
agnostic sequential estimation procedure (that is, requiring no prior knowledge
of the multi-index model) based on a spectral U-statistic over appropriate
Hermite tensors. We further compute the generative leap exponent for several
examples including piecewise linear functions (deep ReLU networks with bias),
and general deep neural networks (with $r$-dimensional first hidden layer).

Conclusion: 双重约束的替代模型在泛化能力和实际应用中表现优异，为PDE求解提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural PDE surrogates can improve the cost-accuracy tradeoff of classical
solvers, but often generalize poorly to new initial conditions and accumulate
errors over time. Physical and symmetry constraints have shown promise in
closing this performance gap, but existing techniques for imposing these
inductive biases are incompatible with the staggered grids commonly used in
computational fluid dynamics. Here we introduce novel input and output layers
that respect physical laws and symmetries on the staggered grids, and for the
first time systematically investigate how these constraints, individually and
in combination, affect the accuracy of PDE surrogates. We focus on two
challenging problems: shallow water equations with closed boundaries and
decaying incompressible turbulence. Compared to strong baselines, symmetries
and physical constraints consistently improve performance across tasks,
architectures, autoregressive prediction steps, accuracy measures, and network
sizes. Symmetries are more effective than physical constraints, but surrogates
with both performed best, even compared to baselines with data augmentation or
pushforward training, while themselves benefiting from the pushforward trick.
Doubly-constrained surrogates also generalize better to initial conditions and
durations beyond the range of the training data, and more accurately predict
real-world ocean currents.

Conclusion: 增大批次大小和降低熵正则化参数ε可以显著提高流模型的训练效率和生成效果。

Abstract: Flow models transform data gradually from one modality (e.g. noise) onto
another (e.g. images). Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent
velocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target
points. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training
flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing
exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much
harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points
independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to
train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would
greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal
transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a
highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In
practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and
$n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs.
These works have advocated using batches of size $n\approx 256$, and considered
OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the
Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a.
Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits
of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully
on the effect of the entropic regularization $\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn
algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to
report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across
multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic
and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large
Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\varepsilon$.

non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian
eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The
expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated
via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet,
these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight
into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of
classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an
expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete
even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt
rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a
method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We
empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification
experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on
graphs from ZINC.

Motivation: 深度伪造技术的快速发展带来了安全挑战，现有检测方法难以区分良性内容和恶意操纵的深度伪造内容。

Conclusion: SocialDF和LLM多因素检测方法为解决社交媒体上的深度伪造问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep generative models has significantly improved
the realism of synthetic media, presenting both opportunities and security
challenges. While deepfake technology has valuable applications in
entertainment and accessibility, it has emerged as a potent vector for
misinformation campaigns, particularly on social media. Existing detection
frameworks struggle to distinguish between benign and adversarially generated
deepfakes engineered to manipulate public perception. To address this
challenge, we introduce SocialDF, a curated dataset reflecting real-world
deepfake challenges on social media platforms. This dataset encompasses
high-fidelity deepfakes sourced from various online ecosystems, ensuring broad
coverage of manipulative techniques. We propose a novel LLM-based multi-factor
detection approach that combines facial recognition, automated speech
transcription, and a multi-agent LLM pipeline to cross-verify audio-visual
cues. Our methodology emphasizes robust, multi-modal verification techniques
that incorporate linguistic, behavioral, and contextual analysis to effectively
discern synthetic media from authentic content.

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods has
revolutionized molecular medicine by driving breakthroughs in genomics,
transcriptomics, drug discovery, and biological systems modeling. The
increasing quantity, multimodality, and heterogeneity of biological datasets
demand automated methods that can produce generalizable predictive models.
Recent developments in large language model-based agents have shown promise for
automating end-to-end ML experimentation on structured benchmarks. However,
when applied to heterogeneous computational biology datasets, these methods
struggle with generalization and success rates. Here, we introduce
Agentomics-ML, a fully autonomous agent-based system designed to produce a
classification model and the necessary files for reproducible training and
inference. Our method follows predefined steps of an ML experimentation
process, repeatedly interacting with the file system through Bash to complete
individual steps. Once an ML model is produced, training and validation metrics
provide scalar feedback to a reflection step to identify issues such as
overfitting. This step then creates verbal feedback for future iterations,
suggesting adjustments to steps such as data representation, model
architecture, and hyperparameter choices. We have evaluated Agentomics-ML on
several established genomic and transcriptomic benchmark datasets and show that
it outperforms existing state-of-the-art agent-based methods in both
generalization and success rates. While state-of-the-art models built by domain
experts still lead in absolute performance on the majority of the computational
biology datasets used in this work, Agentomics-ML narrows the gap for fully
autonomous systems and achieves state-of-the-art performance on one of the used
benchmark datasets. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Ravan的自适应多头LoRA方法，用于解决联邦学习中低秩适应（LoRA）方法因数据和计算异构性导致的精度下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）尚未有效利用边缘设备数据，联邦学习（FL）提供了一种在不传输私有数据的情况下协作微调LLMs的范式。然而，现有的LoRA方法在FL中因异构性导致精度下降。

Method: Ravan通过将权重更新重新参数化为多个LoRA头的加权和（s_iB_iH_iA_i），仅训练核心矩阵H_i和轻量级缩放因子s_i，优化聚焦于最有用的头，从而在不增加通信参数的情况下恢复更高秩的更新。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，Ravan比现有参数高效基线提高了2-8%的测试精度。

Conclusion: Ravan是一种鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案，适用于LLMs的联邦微调。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have not yet effectively leveraged the vast
amounts of edge-device data, and federated learning (FL) offers a promising
paradigm to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without transferring private edge
data to the cloud. To operate within the computation and communication
constraints of edge devices, recent literature on federated fine-tuning of LLMs
proposes the use of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and similar parameter-efficient
methods. However, LoRA-based methods suffer from accuracy degradation in FL
settings, primarily because of data and computational heterogeneity across
clients. We propose \textsc{Ravan}, an adaptive multi-head LoRA method that
balances parameter efficiency and model expressivity by reparameterizing the
weight updates as the sum of multiple LoRA heads
$s_i\textbf{B}_i\textbf{H}_i\textbf{A}_i$ in which only the core matrices
$\textbf{H}_i$ and their lightweight scaling factors $s_i$ are trained. These
trainable scaling factors let the optimization focus on the most useful heads,
recovering a higher-rank approximation of the full update without increasing
the number of communicated parameters since clients upload $s_i\textbf{H}_i$
directly. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that
\textsc{Ravan} improves test accuracy by 2-8\% over prior parameter-efficient
baselines, making it a robust and scalable solution for federated fine-tuning
of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练分布中哪些条件能促使ICL能力出现并泛化到分布外任务。

Method: 通过训练线性函数的变换器，研究任务多样性对ICL能力的影响，并分析模型在不同任务多样性下的表现。

Result: 任务多样性增加时，变换器从仅适应预训练分布过渡到泛化到整个任务空间；类似现象在非线性回归问题中也存在。

Conclusion: 任务多样性是ICL泛化的关键，模型深度和问题维度也影响这一过渡。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained
transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only
a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the
pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize
\emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct
tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of
task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear
functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a
transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the
pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of
distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the
solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and
observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a
phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with
the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as
the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem
influence the transition.

Abstract: Agentic AI has gained significant interest as a research paradigm focused on
autonomy, self-directed learning, and long-term reliability of decision making.
Real-world agentic systems operate in decentralized settings on a large set of
tasks or data distributions with constraints such as limited bandwidth,
asynchronous execution, and the absence of a centralized model or even common
objectives. We posit that exploiting previously learned skills, task
similarities, and communication capabilities in a collective of agentic AI are
challenging but essential elements to enabling scalability, open-endedness, and
beneficial collaborative learning dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Modular
Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning (MOSAIC), an agentic algorithm
that allows multiple agents to independently solve different tasks while also
identifying, sharing, and reusing useful machine-learned knowledge, without
coordination, synchronization, or centralized control. MOSAIC combines three
mechanisms: (1) modular policy composition via neural network masks, (2) cosine
similarity estimation using Wasserstein embeddings for knowledge selection, and
(3) asynchronous communication and policy integration. Results on a set of RL
benchmarks show that MOSAIC has a greater sample efficiency than isolated
learners, i.e., it learns significantly faster, and in some cases, finds
solutions to tasks that cannot be solved by isolated learners. The
collaborative learning and sharing dynamics are also observed to result in the
emergence of ideal curricula of tasks, from easy to hard. These findings
support the case for collaborative learning in agentic systems to achieve
better and continuously evolving performance both at the individual and
collective levels.

Motivation: 保形预测在分布偏移时覆盖保证失效，尤其在子群体偏移情况下，测试环境与校准数据子群体混合不同。

Method: 提出新算法，适应子群体偏移，确保有效覆盖，适用于高维场景和实际机器学习任务。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，新方法在标准保形预测失效时仍能保持覆盖和控制风险。

Conclusion: 新方法成功解决了子群体偏移问题，扩展了保形预测的适用性。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely used to equip black-box machine learning
models with uncertainty quantification enjoying formal coverage guarantees.
However, these guarantees typically break down in the presence of distribution
shifts, where the data distribution at test time differs from the training (or
calibration-time) distribution. In this work, we address subpopulation shifts,
where the test environment exhibits an unknown and differing mixture of
subpopulations compared to the calibration data. We propose new methods that
provably adapt conformal prediction to such shifts, ensuring valid coverage
without requiring explicit knowledge of subpopulation structure. Our algorithms
scale to high-dimensional settings and perform effectively in realistic machine
learning tasks. Extensive experiments on vision (with vision transformers) and
language (with large language models) benchmarks demonstrate that our methods
reliably maintain coverage and controls risk in scenarios where standard
conformal prediction fails.

Abstract: Leveraging the in-context learning (ICL) capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs) for tabular classification has gained significant attention for its
training-free adaptability across diverse datasets. Recent advancements, like
TabPFN, excel in small-scale tabular datasets but struggle to scale for large
and complex datasets. Our work enhances the efficiency and scalability of
TabPFN for larger datasets by incorporating linear attention mechanisms as a
scalable alternative to complexity-quadratic self-attention. Our model,
TabFlex, efficiently handles tabular datasets with thousands of features and
hundreds of classes, scaling seamlessly to millions of samples. For instance,
TabFlex processes the poker-hand dataset with over a million samples in just 5
seconds. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that TabFlex can achieve over a
2x speedup compared to TabPFN and a 1.5x speedup over XGBoost, outperforming 25
tested baselines in terms of efficiency across a diverse range of datasets.
Furthermore, TabFlex remains highly effective on large-scale datasets,
delivering strong performance with significantly reduced computational costs,
especially when combined with data-efficient techniques such as dimensionality
reduction and data sampling.

Conclusion: CoFrNet兼具表现力和解释性，为可解释神经网络架构提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years there has been a considerable amount of research on local
post hoc explanations for neural networks. However, work on building
interpretable neural architectures has been relatively sparse. In this paper,
we present a novel neural architecture, CoFrNet, inspired by the form of
continued fractions which are known to have many attractive properties in
number theory, such as fast convergence of approximations to real numbers. We
show that CoFrNets can be efficiently trained as well as interpreted leveraging
their particular functional form. Moreover, we prove that such architectures
are universal approximators based on a proof strategy that is different than
the typical strategy used to prove universal approximation results for neural
networks based on infinite width (or depth), which is likely to be of
independent interest. We experiment on nonlinear synthetic functions and are
able to accurately model as well as estimate feature attributions and even
higher order terms in some cases, which is a testament to the representational
power as well as interpretability of such architectures. To further showcase
the power of CoFrNets, we experiment on seven real datasets spanning tabular,
text and image modalities, and show that they are either comparable or
significantly better than other interpretable models and multilayer
perceptrons, sometimes approaching the accuracies of state-of-the-art models.

Result: 实证表明，通过简单方法可以显著提升零-shot性能。

Conclusion: 本文为逆折叠模型的自由能基础提供了更清晰的理解，并展示了改进零-shot稳定性预测的潜力。

Abstract: Inverse folding models have proven to be highly effective zero-shot
predictors of protein stability. Despite this success, the link between the
amino acid preferences of an inverse folding model and the free-energy
considerations underlying thermodynamic stability remains incompletely
understood. A better understanding would be of interest not only from a
theoretical perspective, but also potentially provide the basis for stronger
zero-shot stability prediction. In this paper, we take steps to clarify the
free-energy foundations of inverse folding models. Our derivation reveals the
standard practice of likelihood ratios as a simplistic approximation and
suggests several paths towards better estimates of the relative stability. We
empirically assess these approaches and demonstrate that considerable gains in
zero-shot performance can be achieved with fairly simple means.

Motivation: 传统Transformer在时间序列预测中因输入信息密度低和依赖复杂而表现不佳，需要更高效的架构。

Method: FaCTR通过低秩分解机和可学习门控机制实现动态对称跨通道交互，并编码静态和动态协变量。

Result: 在11个公共基准测试中达到最优性能，最大模型仅需40万参数，比基线小50倍。

Conclusion: FaCTR不仅高效且可解释，支持自监督预训练，适用于下游时间序列任务。

Abstract: While Transformers excel in language and vision-where inputs are semantically
rich and exhibit univariate dependency structures-their architectural
complexity leads to diminishing returns in time series forecasting. Time series
data is characterized by low per-timestep information density and complex
dependencies across channels and covariates, requiring conditioning on
structured variable interactions. To address this mismatch and
overparameterization, we propose FaCTR, a lightweight spatiotemporal
Transformer with an explicitly structural design. FaCTR injects dynamic,
symmetric cross-channel interactions-modeled via a low-rank Factorization
Machine into temporally contextualized patch embeddings through a learnable
gating mechanism. It further encodes static and dynamic covariates for
multivariate conditioning. Despite its compact design, FaCTR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on eleven public forecasting benchmarks spanning
both short-term and long-term horizons, with its largest variant using close to
only 400K parameters-on average 50x smaller than competitive spatiotemporal
transformer baselines. In addition, its structured design enables
interpretability through cross-channel influence scores-an essential
requirement for real-world decision-making. Finally, FaCTR supports
self-supervised pretraining, positioning it as a compact yet versatile
foundation for downstream time series tasks.

Abstract: The Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) framework is a leading
approach for achieving efficient learning and robust performance across many RL
tasks. However, MaxEnt methods have also been shown to struggle with
performance-critical control problems in practice, where non-MaxEnt algorithms
can successfully learn. In this work, we analyze how the trade-off between
robustness and optimality affects the performance of MaxEnt algorithms in
complex control tasks: while entropy maximization enhances exploration and
robustness, it can also mislead policy optimization, leading to failure in
tasks that require precise, low-entropy policies. Through experiments on a
variety of control problems, we concretely demonstrate this misleading effect.
Our analysis leads to better understanding of how to balance reward design and
entropy maximization in challenging control problems.

Abstract: The singular values of convolutional mappings encode interesting spectral
properties, which can be used, e.g., to improve generalization and robustness
of convolutional neural networks as well as to facilitate model compression.
However, the computation of singular values is typically very
resource-intensive. The naive approach involves unrolling the convolutional
mapping along the input and channel dimensions into a large and sparse
two-dimensional matrix, making the exact calculation of all singular values
infeasible due to hardware limitations. In particular, this is true for
matrices that represent convolutional mappings with large inputs and a high
number of channels. Existing efficient methods leverage the Fast Fourier
transformation (FFT) to transform convolutional mappings into the frequency
domain, enabling the computation of singular values for matrices representing
convolutions with larger input and channel dimensions. For a constant number of
channels in a given convolution, an FFT can compute N singular values in O(N
log N) complexity. In this work, we propose an approach of complexity O(N)
based on local Fourier analysis, which additionally exploits the shift
invariance of convolutional operators. We provide a theoretical analysis of our
algorithm's runtime and validate its efficiency through numerical experiments.
Our results demonstrate that our proposed method is scalable and offers a
practical solution to calculate the entire set of singular values - along with
the corresponding singular vectors if needed - for high-dimensional
convolutional mappings.

Abstract: Real-world knowledge can take various forms, including structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data. Among these, knowledge graphs are a
form of structured human knowledge that integrate heterogeneous data sources
into structured representations but typically reduce complex n-ary relations to
simple triples, thereby losing higher-order relational details. In contrast,
hypergraphs naturally represent n-ary relations with hyperedges, which directly
connect multiple entities together. Yet hypergraph representation learning
often overlooks entity roles in hyperedges, limiting the fine-grained semantic
modelling. To address these issues, knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs combine the advantages of knowledge graphs and hypergraphs to
better capture the complex structures and role-specific semantics of real-world
knowledge. This survey provides a comprehensive review of methods handling
n-ary relational data, covering both knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs literatures. We propose a two-dimensional taxonomy: the first
dimension categorises models based on their methodology, i.e.,
translation-based models, tensor factorisation-based models, deep neural
network-based models, logic rules-based models, and hyperedge expansion-based
models. The second dimension classifies models according to their awareness of
entity roles and positions in n-ary relations, dividing them into aware-less,
position-aware, and role-aware approaches. Finally, we discuss existing
datasets, negative sampling strategies, and outline open challenges to inspire
future research.

Abstract: The ability to design molecules while preserving similarity to a target
molecule and/or property is crucial for various applications in drug discovery,
chemical design, and biology. We introduce in this paper an efficient
training-free method for navigating and sampling from the molecular space with
a generative Chemical Language Model (CLM), while using the molecular
similarity to the target as a guide. Our method leverages the contextual
representations learned from the CLM itself to estimate the molecular
similarity, which is then used to adjust the autoregressive sampling strategy
of the CLM. At each step of the decoding process, the method tracks the
distance of the current generations from the target and updates the logits to
encourage the preservation of similarity in generations. We implement the
method using a recently proposed $\sim$47M parameter SMILES-based CLM,
GP-MoLFormer, and therefore refer to the method as GP-MoLFormer-Sim, which
enables a test-time update of the deep generative policy to reflect the
contextual similarity to a set of guide molecules. The method is further
integrated into a genetic algorithm (GA) and tested on a set of standard
molecular optimization benchmarks involving property optimization, molecular
rediscovery, and structure-based drug design. Results show that,
GP-MoLFormer-Sim, combined with GA (GP-MoLFormer-Sim+GA) outperforms existing
training-free baseline methods, when the oracle remains black-box. The findings
in this work are a step forward in understanding and guiding the generative
mechanisms of CLMs.

a list of samples is generated from one distribution and an accept is declared
if any one of these samples is identical to the sample generated from the other
distribution. We propose a novel method for generating samples, which extends
the Gumbel-max sampling suggested in Daliri et al. (arXiv:2408.07978) for
coupling probability distributions. We also establish a corresponding lower
bound on the acceptance probability, which we call the list matching lemma. We
next discuss two applications of our setup. First, we develop a new mechanism
for multi-draft speculative sampling that is simple to implement and achieves
performance competitive with baselines such as SpecTr and SpecInfer across a
range of language tasks. Our method also guarantees a certain degree of drafter
invariance with respect to the output tokens which is not supported by existing
schemes. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the token level
acceptance probability. As our second application, we consider distributed
lossy compression with side information in a setting where a source sample is
compressed and available to multiple decoders, each with independent side
information. We propose a compression technique that is based on our
generalization of Gumbel-max sampling and show that it provides significant
gains in experiments involving synthetic Gaussian sources and the MNIST image
dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoQD自动生成行为描述符，无需预定义多样性，通过嵌入策略占用度量实现无监督强化学习和QD优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QD算法依赖手工行为描述符，限制了多样性的探索。AutoQD旨在自动生成行为描述符，摆脱这一限制。

Method: 利用随机傅里叶特征近似策略占用度量的最大均值差异（MMD），生成反映行为差异的低维嵌入作为行为描述符。

Result: 实验证明AutoQD能在连续控制任务中发现多样策略，且嵌入距离随样本和维度增加收敛于真实MMD距离。

Conclusion: AutoQD为无领域知识的开放学习和自动化行为发现提供了新途径。

Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have shown remarkable success in
discovering diverse, high-performing solutions, but rely heavily on
hand-crafted behavioral descriptors that constrain exploration to predefined
notions of diversity. Leveraging the equivalence between policies and occupancy
measures, we present a theoretically grounded approach to automatically
generate behavioral descriptors by embedding the occupancy measures of policies
in Markov Decision Processes. Our method, AutoQD, leverages random Fourier
features to approximate the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between policy
occupancy measures, creating embeddings whose distances reflect meaningful
behavioral differences. A low-dimensional projection of these embeddings that
captures the most behaviorally significant dimensions is then used as
behavioral descriptors for off-the-shelf QD methods. We prove that our
embeddings converge to true MMD distances between occupancy measures as the
number of sampled trajectories and embedding dimensions increase. Through
experiments in multiple continuous control tasks we demonstrate AutoQD's
ability in discovering diverse policies without predefined behavioral
descriptors, presenting a well-motivated alternative to prior methods in
unsupervised Reinforcement Learning and QD optimization. Our approach opens new
possibilities for open-ended learning and automated behavior discovery in
sequential decision making settings without requiring domain-specific
knowledge.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning often involve making predictions based on
both model outputs and the opinions of human experts. In this context, we
investigate the problem of querying experts for class label predictions, using
as few human queries as possible, and leveraging the class probability
estimates of pre-trained classifiers. We develop a general Bayesian framework
for this problem, modeling expert correlation via a joint latent
representation, enabling simulation-based inference about the utility of
additional expert queries, as well as inference of posterior distributions over
unobserved expert labels. We apply our approach to two real-world medical
classification problems, as well as to CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H,
demonstrating substantial reductions relative to baselines in the cost of
querying human experts while maintaining high prediction accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出一种将大型Transformer参数映射到小型专用模型的技术，以降低计算成本并提高任务特定性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现代基础模型计算成本高且知识范围广泛，但特定任务可能仅需部分知识。

Method: 通过任务特定映射，将大型Transformer参数转换为小型专用模型参数。

Result: 在图像建模任务中，生成的小型模型性能优于通用条件模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效降低计算成本并提升任务特定性能。

Abstract: Modern Foundation Models (FMs) are typically trained on corpora spanning a
wide range of different data modalities, topics and downstream tasks. Utilizing
these models can be very computationally expensive and is out of reach for most
consumer devices. Furthermore, most of the broad FM knowledge may actually be
irrelevant for a specific task at hand. Here we explore a technique for mapping
parameters of a large Transformer to parameters of a smaller specialized model.
By making this transformation task-specific, we aim to capture a narrower scope
of the knowledge needed for performing a specific task by a smaller model. We
study our method on image modeling tasks, showing that performance of generated
models exceeds that of universal conditional models.

Result: 该方法在扩散模型中提高了归因准确性，并提供了关于输出如何从训练数据中借鉴的细粒度见解。

Conclusion: 该方法通过建模参数重要性权重，改进了数据归因的准确性，为生成模型的训练数据影响提供了更深入的理解。

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which
training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this
by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

Conclusion: BAQ通过优化位宽分配实现了量化损失最小化，理论分析支持其性能提升。

Abstract: Post-training model quantization is a widely adopted technique for reducing
the memory and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). However,
most existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,
failing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization
noise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization
bitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make
key assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be
expressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat
formulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose
closed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise
quantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as
the equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed
\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows
BAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal
overhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,
achieving up to 56$\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large
language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical
results derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also
provide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains. All codes of this
paper are available at https://github.com/CSU-ModelCompression/BAQ.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Radon-Nikodym Estimator (RNE), a flexible,

control, based on the concept of the density ratio between path distributions.
RNE connects and unifies a variety of existing density estimation and
inference-time control methods under a single and intuitive perspective,

Conclusion: 通过将上下文直接集成到架构中，为高效、适应性强的语言建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Transformers excel at text processing,
but their reliance on prompts for specialized behavior introduces computational
overhead. We propose a modification to a Transformer architecture that
eliminates the need for explicit prompts by learning to encode context into the
model's weights. Our Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) model maintains a
contextual summary at each sequence position, allowing it to update the weights
on the fly based on the preceding context. This approach enables the model to
self-specialize, effectively creating a tailored model for processing
information following a given prefix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on synthetic in-context learning tasks and language modeling benchmarks.
Furthermore, we introduce techniques for enhancing the interpretability of the
learned contextual representations, drawing connections to Variational
Autoencoders and promoting smoother, more consistent context encoding. This
work offers a novel direction for efficient and adaptable language modeling by
integrating context directly into the model's architecture.

Conclusion: 数据质量是AI性能的关键，DSD为商业和多模态AI开发提供了新标准。

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

Result: 在两个真实世界定向图数据（水通量网络和城市交通流网络）上验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提框架能够显著提升GNN对定向图中拓扑差异的捕捉能力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle in preserving high-frequency
components of nodal signals when dealing with directed graphs. Such components
are crucial for modeling flow dynamics, without which a traditional GNN tends
to treat a graph with forward and reverse topologies equal.To make GNNs
sensitive to those high-frequency components thereby being capable to capture
detailed topological differences, this paper proposes a novel framework that
combines 1) explicit difference matrices that model directional gradients and
2) implicit physical constraints that enforce messages passing within GNNs to
be consistent with natural laws. Evaluations on two real-world directed graph
data, namely, water flux network and urban traffic flow network, demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposal.

Abstract: The evolution of sequence modeling architectures, from recurrent neural
networks and convolutional models to Transformers and structured state-space
models, reflects ongoing efforts to address the diverse temporal dependencies
inherent in sequential data. Despite this progress, systematically
characterizing the strengths and limitations of these architectures remains a
fundamental challenge.In this work, we propose a synthetic benchmarking
framework to evaluate how effectively different sequence models capture
distinct temporal structures. The core of this approach is to generate
synthetic targets, each characterized by a memory function and a parameter that
determines the strength of temporal dependence. This setup allows us to produce
a continuum of tasks that vary in temporal complexity, enabling fine-grained
analysis of model behavior concerning specific memory properties. We focus on
four representative memory functions, each corresponding to a distinct class of
temporal structures.Experiments on several sequence modeling architectures
confirm existing theoretical insights and reveal new findings.These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in advancing theoretical
understandingand highlight the importance of using controllable targets with
clearly defined structures for evaluating sequence modeling architectures.

Abstract: Optimizing complex systems, from discovering therapeutic drugs to designing
high-performance materials, remains a fundamental challenge across science and
engineering, as the underlying rules are often unknown and costly to evaluate.
Offline optimization aims to optimize designs for target scores using
pre-collected datasets without system interaction. However, conventional
approaches may fail beyond training data, predicting inaccurate scores and
generating inferior designs. This paper introduces ManGO, a diffusion-based
framework that learns the design-score manifold, capturing the design-score
interdependencies holistically. Unlike existing methods that treat design and
score spaces in isolation, ManGO unifies forward prediction and backward
generation, attaining generalization beyond training data. Key to this is its
derivative-free guidance for conditional generation, coupled with adaptive
inference-time scaling that dynamically optimizes denoising paths. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10
multi-objective optimization methods across diverse domains, including
synthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and real-world

In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated

Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability,
and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the
manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated

Motivation: 现有监测方法多为手动、零星和被动，不适合临床模型的动态环境，且仅有9%的FDA注册AI医疗工具包含部署后监测计划。

Method: 提出将数据变化和模型性能下降检测作为独立的统计假设检验问题，并强调统计严谨性。

Result: 通过统计严谨的监测框架，为临床AI系统的可靠性提供科学依据，并推动相关技术研究。

Conclusion: 部署后监测应基于统计有效性和标签效率的测试框架，以提升临床AI的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: This position paper argues that post-deployment monitoring in clinical AI is
underdeveloped and proposes statistically valid and label-efficient testing
frameworks as a principled foundation for ensuring reliability and safety in
real-world deployment. A recent review found that only 9% of FDA-registered
AI-based healthcare tools include a post-deployment surveillance plan. Existing
monitoring approaches are often manual, sporadic, and reactive, making them
ill-suited for the dynamic environments in which clinical models operate. We
contend that post-deployment monitoring should be grounded in label-efficient
and statistically valid testing frameworks, offering a principled alternative
to current practices. We use the term "statistically valid" to refer to methods
that provide explicit guarantees on error rates (e.g., Type I/II error), enable
formal inference under pre-defined assumptions, and support
reproducibility--features that align with regulatory requirements.
Specifically, we propose that the detection of changes in the data and model
performance degradation should be framed as distinct statistical hypothesis
testing problems. Grounding monitoring in statistical rigor ensures a
reproducible and scientifically sound basis for maintaining the reliability of
clinical AI systems. Importantly, it also opens new research directions for the
technical community--spanning theory, methods, and tools for statistically
principled detection, attribution, and mitigation of post-deployment model
failures in real-world settings.

Motivation: 现有持续学习方法假设智能体能力静态，而现实场景中能力动态变化，因此需要解决动态能力下的策略泛化问题。

Result: 实验表明，AACL框架在三种环境中的表现优于现有方法，实现了跨动作空间的策略泛化。

Conclusion: AACL框架为解决动态能力下的持续学习问题提供了有效方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is a powerful tool that enables agents to learn a
sequence of tasks, accumulating knowledge learned in the past and using it for
problem-solving or future task learning. However, existing CL methods often
assume that the agent's capabilities remain static within dynamic environments,
which doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where capabilities dynamically
change. This paper introduces a new and realistic problem: Continual Learning
with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC), posing a significant challenge for CL
agents: How can policy generalization across different action spaces be
achieved? Inspired by the cortical functions, we propose an Action-Adaptive
Continual Learning framework (AACL) to address this challenge. Our framework
decouples the agent's policy from the specific action space by building an
action representation space. For a new action space, the encoder-decoder of
action representations is adaptively fine-tuned to maintain a balance between
stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we release a benchmark based on three
environments to validate the effectiveness of methods for CL-DC. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms popular methods by
generalizing the policy across action spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统语义通信在低信噪比和分布不匹配情况下的性能问题，利用扩散模型的去噪能力提升鲁棒性。

Method: 基于随机微分方程（SDEs）建立理论框架，推导信噪比与去噪步长的关系，并引入缩放机制处理分布不匹配问题。采用变分自编码器（VAE）进行语义压缩，预训练DM作为通用去噪器。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在低信噪比和分布偏移条件下显著优于传统方法，支持零样本泛化且无需微调。

Conclusion: 该研究为6G系统中GAI驱动的鲁棒语义传输提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by
generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, specifically leveraging
the capabilities of diffusion models (DMs). A rigorous theoretical foundation
is established based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which
elucidates the denoising properties of DMs in mitigating additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) in latent semantic representations. Crucially, a
closed-form analytical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
the denoising timestep is derived, enabling the optimal selection of diffusion
parameters for any given channel condition. To address the distribution
mismatch between the received signal and the DM's training data, a
mathematically principled scaling mechanism is introduced, ensuring robust
performance across a wide range of SNRs without requiring model fine-tuning.
Built upon this theoretical insight, we develop a latent diffusion model
(LDM)-based semantic transceiver, wherein a variational autoencoder (VAE) is
employed for efficient semantic compression, and a pretrained DM serves as a
universal denoiser. Notably, the proposed architecture is fully training-free
at inference time, offering high modularity and compatibility with large-scale
pretrained LDMs. This design inherently supports zero-shot generalization and
mitigates the challenges posed by out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms conventional neural-network-based semantic communication baselines,
particularly under low SNR conditions and distributional shifts, thereby
establishing a promising direction for GAI-driven robust semantic transmission
in future 6G systems.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a leading parameter-efficient
fine-tuning technique for adapting large foundation models, yet it often locks
adapters into suboptimal minima near their initialization. This hampers model
generalization and limits downstream operators such as adapter merging and
pruning. Here, we propose CoTo, a progressive training strategy that gradually
increases adapters' activation probability over the course of fine-tuning. By
stochastically deactivating adapters, CoTo encourages more balanced
optimization and broader exploration of the loss landscape. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that CoTo promotes layer-wise dropout stability
and linear mode connectivity, and we adopt a cooperative-game approach to
quantify each adapter's marginal contribution. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoTo consistently boosts single-task performance, enhances
multi-task merging accuracy, improves pruning robustness, and reduces training
overhead, all while remaining compatible with diverse LoRA variants. Code is

*Adrian Ly,Richard Dazeley,Peter Vamplew,Francisco Cruz,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EEDQN的新算法，结合了集成学习和弹性步长更新，以解决深度强化学习中的高估偏差和样本效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对DQN算法的改进缺乏对不同改进之间交互的理解，尤其是集成和多步方法在减少高估偏差方面的潜力。

Method: 提出EEDQN算法，统一集成学习和弹性步长更新，并在MinAtar基准测试中评估其性能。

Result: EEDQN在所有测试环境中表现稳健，优于基线DQN方法，并在大多数MinAtar环境中达到或超过最先进的集成DQN。

Conclusion: 系统结合算法改进具有潜力，集成和多步方法的精心整合可以带来显著收益。

Abstract: While many algorithmic extensions to Deep Q-Networks (DQN) have been
proposed, there remains limited understanding of how different improvements
interact. In particular, multi-step and ensemble style extensions have shown
promise in reducing overestimation bias, thereby improving sample efficiency
and algorithmic stability. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm called
Ensemble Elastic Step DQN (EEDQN), which unifies ensembles with elastic step
updates to stabilise algorithmic performance. EEDQN is designed to address two
major challenges in deep reinforcement learning: overestimation bias and sample
efficiency. We evaluated EEDQN against standard and ensemble DQN variants
across the MinAtar benchmark, a set of environments that emphasise behavioral
learning while reducing representational complexity. Our results show that
EEDQN achieves consistently robust performance across all tested environments,
outperforming baseline DQN methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art
ensemble DQNs in final returns on most of the MinAtar environments. These
findings highlight the potential of systematically combining algorithmic
improvements and provide evidence that ensemble and multi-step methods, when
carefully integrated, can yield substantial gains.

*Pascal Jr Tikeng Notsawo,Guillaume Dumas,Guillaume Rabusseau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过正则化（显式或隐式）诱导神经网络中的“grokking”现象，并分析了其与模型泛化的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络在梯度优化过程中出现的延迟泛化现象（grokking），并探索正则化对其的影响。

Method: 通过显式或隐式正则化（如ℓ₁或核范数）诱导grokking，并分析深度和参数化对其的作用。

Result: 发现正则化可以诱导grokking，且深度模型无需显式正则化即可实现；ℓ₂范数在非权重衰减情况下不可靠。

Conclusion: 正则化和数据选择可显著影响grokking现象，为理解神经网络泛化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Grokking refers to a delayed generalization following overfitting when
optimizing artificial neural networks with gradient-based methods. In this
work, we demonstrate that grokking can be induced by regularization, either
explicit or implicit. More precisely, we show that when there exists a model
with a property $P$ (e.g., sparse or low-rank weights) that generalizes on the
problem of interest, gradient descent with a small but non-zero regularization
of $P$ (e.g., $\ell_1$ or nuclear norm regularization) results in grokking.
This extends previous work showing that small non-zero weight decay induces
grokking. Moreover, our analysis shows that over-parameterization by adding
depth makes it possible to grok or ungrok without explicitly using
regularization, which is impossible in shallow cases. We further show that the
$\ell_2$ norm is not a reliable proxy for generalization when the model is
regularized toward a different property $P$, as the $\ell_2$ norm grows in many
cases where no weight decay is used, but the model generalizes anyway. We also
show that grokking can be amplified solely through data selection, with any
other hyperparameter fixed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的多标签分类（MLC）损失函数，通过归一化加权几何平均预测类别概率，解决负数据过多的问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多标签分类任务中，负数据（无类别实例）过多会干扰学习过程，影响正实例的准确分类。传统方法引入负类别会增加冗余，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 重新设计标准MLC损失函数，通过归一化加权几何平均预测类别概率，计算任何类别存在的似然，并引入正则化参数控制负类别概率的贡献。

Result: 在多个大规模数据集（SewerML、COCO、ChestX-ray14）上，改进的损失函数显著提升了性能，F1、F2和平均精度分别提高了6.01、8.06和3.11个百分点。

Conclusion: 提出的损失函数在不增加参数或计算复杂度的情况下，有效解决了负数据问题，提升了多标签分类的性能。

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据流具有非平稳性，现有方法忽略了标签空间和分布的联合演化问题，尤其是在有限监督和持续不确定性的情况下。

Method: CSFA框架包括训练无关的原型校准机制和基于可靠代理间隙锐度感知最小化的源无关适应算法。

Result: 实验证明CSFA在开放世界流场景中优于现有方法，能够稳定适应语义和分布的演化。

Conclusion: CSFA为开放环境流数据中的概念漂移问题提供了一种统一的解决方案，具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Real-world data streams exhibit inherent non-stationarity characterized by
concept drift, posing significant challenges for adaptive learning systems.
While existing methods address isolated distribution shifts, they overlook the
critical co-evolution of label spaces and distributions under limited
supervision and persistent uncertainty. To address this, we formalize
Generalized Incremental Learning under Concept Drift (GILCD), characterizing
the joint evolution of distributions and label spaces in open-environment
streaming contexts, and propose a novel framework called Calibrated Source-Free
Adaptation (CSFA). First, CSFA introduces a training-free prototype calibration
mechanism that dynamically fuses emerging prototypes with base representations,
enabling stable new-class identification without optimization overhead. Second,
we design a novel source-free adaptation algorithm, i.e., Reliable Surrogate
Gap Sharpness-aware (RSGS) minimization. It integrates sharpness-aware
perturbation loss optimization with surrogate gap minimization, while employing
entropy-based uncertainty filtering to discard unreliable samples. This
mechanism ensures robust distribution alignment and mitigates generalization
degradation caused by uncertainties. Therefore, CSFA establishes a unified
framework for stable adaptation to evolving semantics and distributions in
open-world streaming scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the superior
performance and effectiveness of CSFA compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过结合提示工程和小型LoRA适配器，提出了一种低成本、透明且易调整的奖励函数方法，替代了传统的高参数奖励模型，并在静态评估和在线RLHF中取得了新突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代RLHF流程中，奖励模型训练是成本瓶颈，需要大量参数和离线调优阶段。本文旨在通过轻量级方法替代传统高参数模型，降低成本并提升效率。

Method: 使用冻结的7B指令调优LLM，仅添加一行JSON规则和rank-16 LoRA适配器（影响0.8%参数），作为完整替代传统高参数评估模型。

Result: 在RewardBench上达到96.2%准确率，优于27B至70B参数的专用奖励网络；7B模型在GSM-8K上通过在线PPO实现92%准确率，超越70B DPO基线。

Conclusion: 该方法通过轻量级设计实现了高效、透明的奖励函数，无需离线阶段，并在静态评估和在线RLHF中取得最佳效果。

Abstract: Reward-model training is the cost bottleneck in modern Reinforcement Learning
Human Feedback (RLHF) pipelines, often requiring tens of billions of parameters
and an offline preference-tuning phase. In the proposed method, a frozen,
instruction-tuned 7B LLM is augmented with only a one line JSON rubric and a
rank-16 LoRA adapter (affecting just 0.8% of the model's parameters), enabling
it to serve as a complete substitute for the previously used heavyweight
evaluation models. The plug-and-play judge achieves 96.2% accuracy on
RewardBench, outperforming specialized reward networks ranging from 27B to 70B
parameters. Additionally, it allows a 7B actor to outperform the top 70B DPO
baseline, which scores 61.8%, by achieving 92% exact match accuracy on GSM-8K
utilizing online PPO. Thorough ablations indicate that (i) six in context
demonstrations deliver the majority of the zero-to-few-shot improvements
(+2pp), and (ii) the LoRA effectively addresses the remaining disparity,
particularly in the safety and adversarial Chat-Hard segments. The proposed
model introduces HH-Rationales, a subset of 10,000 pairs from Anthropic
HH-RLHF, to examine interpretability, accompanied by human generated
justifications. GPT-4 scoring indicates that our LoRA judge attains
approximately = 9/10 in similarity to human explanations, while zero-shot
judges score around =5/10. These results indicate that the combination of
prompt engineering and tiny LoRA produces a cost effective, transparent, and
easily adjustable reward function, removing the offline phase while achieving
new state-of-the-art outcomes for both static evaluation and online RLHF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行凸显了准确、及时的住院预测对医疗规划的重要性，但现有模型在变异株激增时表现不佳。

Method: 研究采用LSTM框架，引入时空特征SPH（基于Facebook社交连接指数），并通过多时间范围集成策略优化预测。

Result: 在Delta和Omicron激增期间，该模型比COVID-19 Forecast Hub的集成模型平均每州分别减少27、42、54和69例住院预测误差。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提升了住院预测能力，还证明了SPH等时空特征在传染病传播动态建模中的重要性。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic's severe impact highlighted the need for accurate,
timely hospitalization forecasting to support effective healthcare planning.
However, most forecasting models struggled, especially during variant surges,
when they were needed most. This study introduces a novel Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) framework for forecasting daily state-level incident
hospitalizations in the United States. We present a spatiotemporal feature,
Social Proximity to Hospitalizations (SPH), derived from Facebook's Social
Connectedness Index to improve forecasts. SPH serves as a proxy for interstate
population interaction, capturing transmission dynamics across space and time.
Our parallel LSTM architecture captures both short- and long-term temporal
dependencies, and our multi-horizon ensembling strategy balances consistency
and forecasting error. Evaluation against COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble models
during the Delta and Omicron surges reveals superiority of our model. On
average, our model surpasses the ensemble by 27, 42, 54, and 69
hospitalizations per state on the $7^{th}$, $14^{th}$, $21^{st}$, and $28^{th}$
forecast days, respectively, during the Omicron surge. Data-ablation
experiments confirm SPH's predictive power, highlighting its effectiveness in
enhancing forecasting models. This research not only advances hospitalization
forecasting but also underscores the significance of spatiotemporal features,
such as SPH, in refining predictive performance in modeling the complex
dynamics of infectious disease spread.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于流匹配模型的模仿学习框架flowOE，用于改进金融市场中的最优执行策略，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最优执行策略（如Almgren-Chriss模型）在动态市场中表现不佳，需要更灵活的方法。

Method: flowOE通过模仿学习从多种专家策略中学习，并结合精炼损失函数优化行为。

Result: 实验表明flowOE在各种市场条件下均优于专家模型和传统基准，实现更高收益和更低风险。

Conclusion: flowOE展示了在自适应最优执行中的实用性和潜力。

Abstract: Optimal execution in financial markets refers to the process of strategically
transacting a large volume of assets over a period to achieve the best possible
outcome by balancing the trade-off between market impact costs and timing or
volatility risks. Traditional optimal execution strategies, such as static
Almgren-Chriss models, often prove suboptimal in dynamic financial markets.
This paper propose flowOE, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow
matching models, to address these limitations. FlowOE learns from a diverse set
of expert traditional strategies and adaptively selects the most suitable
expert behavior for prevailing market conditions. A key innovation is the
incorporation of a refining loss function during the imitation process,
enabling flowOE not only to mimic but also to improve upon the learned expert
actions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply flow
matching models in a stochastic optimal execution problem. Empirical
evaluations across various market conditions demonstrate that flowOE
significantly outperforms both the specifically calibrated expert models and
other traditional benchmarks, achieving higher profits with reduced risk. These
results underscore the practical applicability and potential of flowOE to
enhance adaptive optimal execution.

TL;DR: BiTrajDiff是一种双向轨迹扩散框架，通过同时生成未来和历史轨迹，提升离线强化学习的数据多样性，优于现有数据增强方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习中静态数据集存在分布偏差，限制了泛化能力。现有数据增强方法仅关注未来轨迹重建，忽略了历史轨迹探索。

Method: 提出BiTrajDiff框架，将轨迹生成任务分解为两个互补的扩散过程：前向生成未来轨迹，后向生成历史轨迹。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，BiTrajDiff表现优于其他先进数据增强方法。

Conclusion: BiTrajDiff通过双向轨迹扩散显著提升数据集多样性，为离线强化学习提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that
effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on
pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit
distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this
limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which
leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising
results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future
trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history
transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders
the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to
critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we
introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework
for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any
intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task
into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating
forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating
backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can
efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially
valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating
dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite
demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other
advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是验证在加密货币价格短期预测中，增加神经网络复杂度是否真的提升性能，还是数据预处理和特征工程起主要作用。

Method: 通过对比从逻辑回归、XGBoost到深度模型（DeepLOB、Conv1D+LSTM）的多种模型，使用BTC/USDT的限价订单簿数据，并引入两种数据过滤方法（Kalman、Savitzky Golay）和两种标签方案（二元和三元）。

Conclusion: 数据预处理和特征工程在加密货币价格预测中比模型复杂度更重要，简单模型在性能和效率上更具优势。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency price dynamics are driven largely by microstructural supply
demand imbalances in the limit order book (LOB), yet the highly noisy nature of
LOB data complicates the signal extraction process. Prior research has
demonstrated that deep-learning architectures can yield promising predictive
performance on pre-processed equity and futures LOB data, but they often treat
model complexity as an unqualified virtue. In this paper, we aim to examine
whether adding extra hidden layers or parameters to "blackbox ish" neural
networks genuinely enhances short term price forecasting, or if gains are
primarily attributable to data preprocessing and feature engineering. We
benchmark a spectrum of models from interpretable baselines, logistic
regression, XGBoost to deep architectures (DeepLOB, Conv1D+LSTM) on BTC/USDT
LOB snapshots sampled at 100 ms to multi second intervals using publicly
available Bybit data. We introduce two data filtering pipelines (Kalman,
Savitzky Golay) and evaluate both binary (up/down) and ternary (up/flat/down)
labeling schemes. Our analysis compares models on out of sample accuracy,
latency, and robustness to noise. Results reveal that, with data preprocessing
and hyperparameter tuning, simpler models can match and even exceed the
performance of more complex networks, offering faster inference and greater
interpretability.

Motivation: 现有虚拟筛选方法依赖于已知配体结合口袋的holo蛋白结构，而在早期药物发现中常见的apo或预测结构（如AlphaFold2生成）上性能显著下降。

Method: 方法包括三模态对比学习模块和对齐配体、holo口袋及检测到的空腔表示，以及基于交叉注意力的适配器动态聚合候选结合位点。

Conclusion: 该方法在缺乏实验解析的蛋白-配体复合物场景下，有望推动首创药物发现。

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is a critical component of modern drug discovery, yet
most existing methods--whether physics-based or deep learning-based--are
developed around holo protein structures with known ligand-bound pockets.
Consequently, their performance degrades significantly on apo or predicted
structures such as those from AlphaFold2, which are more representative of
real-world early-stage drug discovery, where pocket information is often
missing. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-and-aggregation framework to
enable accurate virtual screening under structural uncertainty. Our method
comprises two core components: (1) a tri-modal contrastive learning module that
aligns representations of the ligand, the holo pocket, and cavities detected
from structures, thereby enhancing robustness to pocket localization error; and
(2) a cross-attention based adapter for dynamically aggregating candidate
binding sites, enabling the model to learn from activity data even without
precise pocket annotations. We evaluated our method on a newly curated
benchmark of apo structures, where it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in blind apo setting, improving the early enrichment
factor (EF1%) from 11.75 to 37.19. Notably, it also maintains strong
performance on holo structures. These results demonstrate the promise of our
approach in advancing first-in-class drug discovery, particularly in scenarios
lacking experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes.

Abstract: Understanding the function of individual units in a neural network is an
important building block for mechanistic interpretability. This is often done
by generating a simple text explanation of the behavior of individual neurons
or units. For these explanations to be useful, we must understand how reliable
and truthful they are. In this work we unify many existing explanation
evaluation methods under one mathematical framework. This allows us to compare
existing evaluation metrics, understand the evaluation pipeline with increased
clarity and apply existing statistical methods on the evaluation. In addition,
we propose two simple sanity checks on the evaluation metrics and show that
many commonly used metrics fail these tests and do not change their score after
massive changes to the concept labels. Based on our experimental and
theoretical results, we propose guidelines that future evaluations should
follow and identify a set of reliable evaluation metrics.

Result: SPDO在通信和计算复杂度上达到最优，实验显示其显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPDO为分散优化提供了高效解决方案，平衡了通信和计算需求。

Abstract: Reducing communication complexity is critical for efficient decentralized
optimization. The proximal decentralized optimization (PDO) framework is
particularly appealing, as methods within this framework can exploit functional
similarity among nodes to reduce communication rounds. Specifically, when local
functions at different nodes are similar, these methods achieve faster
convergence with fewer communication steps. However, existing PDO methods often
require highly accurate solutions to subproblems associated with the proximal
operator, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we
propose the Stabilized Proximal Decentralized Optimization (SPDO) method, which
achieves state-of-the-art communication and computational complexities within
the PDO framework. Additionally, we refine the analysis of existing PDO methods
by relaxing subproblem accuracy requirements and leveraging average functional
similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that SPDO significantly
outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Simulating collisions of deformable objects is a fundamental yet challenging
task due to the complexity of modeling solid mechanics and multi-body
interactions. Existing data-driven methods often suffer from lack of
equivariance to physical symmetries, inadequate handling of collisions, and
limited scalability. Here we introduce EqCollide, the first end-to-end
equivariant neural fields simulator for deformable objects and their
collisions. We propose an equivariant encoder to map object geometry and
velocity into latent control points. A subsequent equivariant Graph Neural
Network-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation models the interactions
among control points via collision-aware message passing. To reconstruct
velocity fields, we query a neural field conditioned on control point features,
enabling continuous and resolution-independent motion predictions. Experimental
results show that EqCollide achieves accurate, stable, and scalable simulations
across diverse object configurations, and our model achieves 24.34% to 35.82%
lower rollout MSE even compared with the best-performing baseline model.
Furthermore, our model could generalize to more colliding objects and extended
temporal horizons, and stay robust to input transformed with group action.

Abstract: Ensemble learning is characterized by flexibility, high precision, and
refined structure. As a critical component within computational finance, option
pricing with machine learning requires both high predictive accuracy and
reduced structural complexity-features that align well with the inherent
advantages of ensemble learning. This paper investigates the application of
ensemble learning to option pricing, and conducts a comparative analysis with
classical machine learning models to assess their performance in terms of
accuracy, local feature extraction, and robustness to noise. A novel
experimental strategy is introduced, leveraging parameter transfer across
experiments to improve robustness and realism in financial simulations.Building
upon this strategy, an evaluation mechanism is developed that incorporates a
scoring strategy and a weighted evaluation strategy explicitly emphasizing the

### [90] [Neural Collapse in Cumulative Link Models for Ordinal Regression: An Analysis with Unconstrained Feature Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05801)
*Chuang Ma,Tomoyuki Obuchi,Toshiyuki Tanaka*

TL;DR: 研究发现深度序数回归任务中会出现类似神经崩溃的现象，称为序数神经崩溃（ONC），并具有三个特征性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经崩溃现象是否在序数回归任务中出现，以深化对深度神经网络行为的理解。

Method: 结合累积链接模型和未约束特征模型（UFM），理论分析并实证验证ONC现象。

Result: ONC现象确实存在，表现为类内特征均值对齐、类均值与分类器对齐、潜在变量按类顺序排列。

Conclusion: ONC现象为序数回归任务提供了新的理论支持，并建议使用固定阈值。

Abstract: A phenomenon known as ''Neural Collapse (NC)'' in deep classification tasks,
in which the penultimate-layer features and the final classifiers exhibit an
extremely simple geometric structure, has recently attracted considerable
attention, with the expectation that it can deepen our understanding of how
deep neural networks behave. The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) has been
proposed to explain NC theoretically, and there emerges a growing body of work
that extends NC to tasks other than classification and leverages it for
practical applications. In this study, we investigate whether a similar
phenomenon arises in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, via combining the
cumulative link model for OR and UFM. We show that a phenomenon we call Ordinal
Neural Collapse (ONC) indeed emerges and is characterized by the following
three properties: (ONC1) all optimal features in the same class collapse to
their within-class mean when regularization is applied; (ONC2) these class
means align with the classifier, meaning that they collapse onto a
one-dimensional subspace; (ONC3) the optimal latent variables (corresponding to
logits or preactivations in classification tasks) are aligned according to the
class order, and in particular, in the zero-regularization limit, a highly
local and simple geometric relationship emerges between the latent variables
and the threshold values. We prove these properties analytically within the UFM
framework with fixed threshold values and corroborate them empirically across a
variety of datasets. We also discuss how these insights can be leveraged in OR,
highlighting the use of fixed thresholds.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的方法PiPE，结合了位置编码（PE）和持久同调（PH），证明了其表达力优于两者，并在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消息传递图神经网络（GNNs）的局部归纳偏差限制了其利用关键结构信息的能力，PE和PH是两种缓解方法，但缺乏理论比较。

Method: 通过理论分析比较PE和PH的表达力，提出PiPE方法，结合两者的优势。

Result: PiPE在分子性质预测、图分类和分布外泛化等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: PiPE是一种表达力更强的新方法，推动了图表示学习的发展。

Abstract: The local inductive bias of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs)
hampers their ability to exploit key structural information (e.g., connectivity
and cycles). Positional encoding (PE) and Persistent Homology (PH) have emerged
as two promising approaches to mitigate this issue. PE schemes endow GNNs with
location-aware features, while PH methods enhance GNNs with multiresolution
topological features. However, a rigorous theoretical characterization of the
relative merits and shortcomings of PE and PH has remained elusive. We bridge
this gap by establishing that neither paradigm is more expressive than the
other, providing novel constructions where one approach fails but the other
succeeds. Our insights inform the design of a novel learnable method, PiPE
(Persistence-informed Positional Encoding), which is provably more expressive
than both PH and PE. PiPE demonstrates strong performance across a variety of
tasks (e.g., molecule property prediction, graph classification, and
out-of-distribution generalization), thereby advancing the frontiers of graph
representation learning. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种基于双曲几何的向后兼容表示学习方法，通过处理旧模型的不确定性，提升新模型的学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有欧几里得空间中的兼容方法忽视旧模型的不确定性，强制新模型重建过时表示，阻碍学习过程。

Method: 将嵌入提升到双曲空间，约束新嵌入位于旧嵌入的蕴含锥内，并引入动态对比对齐损失。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在实现兼容性方面的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建更具弹性和适应性的机器学习系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Backward compatible representation learning enables updated models to
integrate seamlessly with existing ones, avoiding to reprocess stored data.
Despite recent advances, existing compatibility approaches in Euclidean space
neglect the uncertainty in the old embedding model and force the new model to
reconstruct outdated representations regardless of their quality, thereby
hindering the learning process of the new model. In this paper, we propose to
switch perspectives to hyperbolic geometry, where we treat time as a natural
axis for capturing a model's confidence and evolution. By lifting embeddings
into hyperbolic space and constraining updated embeddings to lie within the
entailment cone of the old ones, we maintain generational consistency across
models while accounting for uncertainties in the representations. To further
enhance compatibility, we introduce a robust contrastive alignment loss that
dynamically adjusts alignment weights based on the uncertainty of the old
embeddings. Experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method in
achieving compatibility, paving the way for more resilient and adaptable
machine learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非平稳时间序列的统计特性随时间变化，导致深度学习模型泛化能力差。现有方法忽视了时间序列的多组分特性，不同组分表现出不同的非平稳行为。

Method: WDAN利用离散小波变换将输入分解为低频趋势和高频波动，并对每部分应用定制化的归一化策略。对强非平稳的趋势分量，采用一阶差分提取稳定特征以预测归一化参数。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，WDAN能显著提高不同主干模型的预测准确性。

Conclusion: WDAN是一种模型无关的框架，能有效处理时间序列预测中的非平稳性问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Forecasting non-stationary time series is a challenging task because their
statistical properties often change over time, making it hard for deep models
to generalize well. Instance-level normalization techniques can help address
shifts in temporal distribution. However, most existing methods overlook the
multi-component nature of time series, where different components exhibit
distinct non-stationary behaviors. In this paper, we propose Wavelet-based
Disentangled Adaptive Normalization (WDAN), a model-agnostic framework designed
to address non-stationarity in time series forecasting. WDAN uses discrete
wavelet transforms to break down the input into low-frequency trends and
high-frequency fluctuations. It then applies tailored normalization strategies
to each part. For trend components that exhibit strong non-stationarity, we
apply first-order differencing to extract stable features used for predicting
normalization parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that WDAN consistently improves forecasting accuracy across various
backbone model. Code is available at this repository:

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

Abstract: Clustering ensemble has emerged as an important research topic in the field
of machine learning. Although numerous methods have been proposed to improve
clustering quality, most existing approaches overlook the need for
interpretability in high-stakes applications. In domains such as medical
diagnosis and financial risk assessment, algorithms must not only be accurate
but also interpretable to ensure transparent and trustworthy decision-making.
Therefore, to fill the gap of lack of interpretable algorithms in the field of
clustering ensemble, we propose the first interpretable clustering ensemble
algorithm in the literature. By treating base partitions as categorical
variables, our method constructs a decision tree in the original feature space
and use the statistical association test to guide the tree building process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves comparable
performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) clustering ensemble methods while
maintaining an additional feature of interpretability. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first interpretable algorithm specifically designed for
clustering ensemble, offering a new perspective for future research in
interpretable clustering.

Conclusion: 该方法为梯度训练提供了可行的替代方案，尤其在并行化和非可微分操作处理上具有明显优势。

Abstract: We present a feasibility-seeking approach to neural network training. This
mathematical optimization framework is distinct from conventional
gradient-based loss minimization and uses projection operators and iterative
projection algorithms. We reformulate training as a large-scale feasibility
problem: finding network parameters and states that satisfy local constraints
derived from its elementary operations. Training then involves projecting onto
these constraints, a local operation that can be parallelized across the
network. We introduce PJAX, a JAX-based software framework that enables this
paradigm. PJAX composes projection operators for elementary operations,
automatically deriving the solution operators for the feasibility problems
(akin to autodiff for derivatives). It inherently supports GPU/TPU
acceleration, provides a familiar NumPy-like API, and is extensible. We train
diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs) on standard benchmarks using PJAX,
demonstrating its functionality and generality. Our results show that this
approach is as a compelling alternative to gradient-based training, with clear
advantages in parallelism and the ability to handle non-differentiable
operations.

Result: 在4个真实数据集上显著优于现有方法，并已部署为EDF的能耗监测服务核心算法。

Conclusion: NILMFormer有效解决了数据分布漂移问题，为智能电表数据提供了更精确的负载分解。

Abstract: Millions of smart meters have been deployed worldwide, collecting the total
power consumed by individual households. Based on these data, electricity
suppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback
on the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates
have relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly
consumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership.
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a
household's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power
for individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM
are based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire
household consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world
smart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each
segmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper
introduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new
subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the
distribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only
on the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world
datasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches.
Our solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's
(Electricit\'e De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed
insights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power
consumption. This paper appeared in KDD 2025.

Abstract: Improving smart grid system management is crucial in the fight against
climate change, and enabling consumers to play an active role in this effort is
a significant challenge for electricity suppliers. In this regard, millions of
smart meters have been deployed worldwide in the last decade, recording the
main electricity power consumed in individual households. This data produces
valuable information that can help them reduce their electricity footprint;
nevertheless, the collected signal aggregates the consumption of the different
appliances running simultaneously in the house, making it difficult to
apprehend. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) refers to the challenge of
estimating the power consumption, pattern, or on/off state activation of
individual appliances using the main smart meter signal. Recent methods
proposed to tackle this task are based on a fully supervised deep-learning
approach that requires both the aggregate signal and the ground truth of
individual appliance power. However, such labels are expensive to collect and
extremely scarce in practice, as they require conducting intrusive surveys in
households to monitor each appliance. In this paper, we introduce CamAL, a
weakly supervised approach for appliance pattern localization that only
requires information on the presence of an appliance in a household to be
trained. CamAL merges an ensemble of deep-learning classifiers combined with an
explainable classification method to be able to localize appliance patterns.
Our experimental evaluation, conducted on 4 real-world datasets, demonstrates
that CamAL significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised baselines and
that current SotA fully supervised NILM approaches require significantly more
labels to reach CamAL performances. The source of our experiments is available

Conclusion: 该框架有效统一了离散决策和连续动态，为驾驶员异质性建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in car-following modeling lies in accurately
representing the multi-scale complexity of driving behaviors, particularly the
intra-driver heterogeneity where a single driver's actions fluctuate
dynamically under varying conditions. While existing models, both conventional
and data-driven, address behavioral heterogeneity to some extent, they often
emphasize inter-driver heterogeneity or rely on simplified assumptions,
limiting their ability to capture the dynamic heterogeneity of a single driver
under different driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose a novel
data-driven car-following framework that systematically embeds discrete driving
regimes (e.g., steady-state following, acceleration, cruising) into vehicular
motion predictions. Leveraging high-resolution traffic trajectory datasets, the
proposed hybrid deep learning architecture combines Gated Recurrent Units for
discrete driving regime classification with Long Short-Term Memory networks for
continuous kinematic prediction, unifying discrete decision-making processes
and continuous vehicular dynamics to comprehensively represent inter- and
intra-driver heterogeneity. Driving regimes are identified using a bottom-up
segmentation algorithm and Dynamic Time Warping, ensuring robust
characterization of behavioral states across diverse traffic scenarios.
Comparative analyses demonstrate that the framework significantly reduces
prediction errors for acceleration (maximum MSE improvement reached 58.47\%),
speed, and spacing metrics while reproducing critical traffic phenomena, such
as stop-and-go wave propagation and oscillatory dynamics.

Abstract: In recent years, electricity suppliers have installed millions of smart
meters worldwide to improve the management of the smart grid system. These
meters collect a large amount of electrical consumption data to produce
valuable information to help consumers reduce their electricity footprint.
However, having non-expert users (e.g., consumers or sales advisors) understand
these data and derive usage patterns for different appliances has become a
significant challenge for electricity suppliers because these data record the
aggregated behavior of all appliances. At the same time, ground-truth labels
(which could train appliance detection and localization models) are expensive
to collect and extremely scarce in practice. This paper introduces DeviceScope,
an interactive tool designed to facilitate understanding smart meter data by
detecting and localizing individual appliance patterns within a given time
period. Our system is based on CamAL (Class Activation Map-based Appliance

that only requires the knowledge of the existence of an appliance in a

Conclusion: Over-PINNs框架有效提升了PINNs的精度，适用于复杂PDE问题。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) serve as the cornerstone of
mathematical physics. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
have significantly reduced the dependence on large datasets by embedding
physical laws directly into the training of neural networks. However, when
dealing with complex problems, the accuracy of PINNs still has room for
improvement. To address this issue, we introduce the Over-PINNs framework,
which leverages automatic differentiation (AD) to generate higher-order
auxiliary equations that impose additional physical constraints. These
equations are incorporated as extra loss terms in the training process,
effectively enhancing the model's ability to capture physical information
through an "overdetermined" approach. Numerical results illustrate that this
method exhibits strong versatility in solving various types of PDEs. It
achieves a significant improvement in solution accuracy without incurring
substantial additional computational costs.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the impact of road maintenance schedules on traffic
conditions is important because maintenance operations can substantially worsen
congestion if not carefully planned. Reliable estimates allow planners to avoid
excessive delays during periods of roadwork. Since the exact increase in
congestion is difficult to predict analytically, traffic simulations are
commonly used to assess the redistribution of the flow of traffic. However,
when applied to long-term maintenance planning involving many overlapping
projects and scheduling alternatives, these simulations must be run thousands
of times, resulting in a significant computational burden. This paper
investigates the use of machine learning-based surrogate models to predict
network-wide congestion caused by simultaneous road renovations. We frame the
problem as a supervised learning task, using one-hot encodings, engineered
traffic features, and heuristic approximations. A range of linear,
ensemble-based, probabilistic, and neural regression models is evaluated under
an online learning framework in which data progressively becomes available. The
experimental results show that the Costliest Subset Heuristic provides a
reasonable approximation when limited training data is available, and that most
regression models fail to outperform it, with the exception of XGBoost, which
achieves substantially better accuracy. In overall performance, XGBoost
significantly outperforms alternatives in a range of metrics, most strikingly
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Pinball loss, where it achieves a
MAPE of 11% and outperforms the next-best model by 20% and 38% respectively.
This modeling approach has the potential to reduce the computational burden of
large-scale traffic assignment problems in maintenance planning.

Conclusion: C-EDL是一种高效且轻量的不确定性量化方法，显著提升了对抗性和OOD鲁棒性，适用于高风险应用。

Abstract: Reliability of deep learning models is critical for deployment in high-stakes
applications, where out-of-distribution or adversarial inputs may lead to
detrimental outcomes. Evidential Deep Learning, an efficient paradigm for
uncertainty quantification, models predictions as Dirichlet distributions of a
single forward pass. However, EDL is particularly vulnerable to adversarially
perturbed inputs, making overconfident errors. Conflict-aware Evidential Deep
Learning (C-EDL) is a lightweight post-hoc uncertainty quantification approach
that mitigates these issues, enhancing adversarial and OOD robustness without
retraining. C-EDL generates diverse, task-preserving transformations per input
and quantifies representational disagreement to calibrate uncertainty estimates
when needed. C-EDL's conflict-aware prediction adjustment improves detection of
OOD and adversarial inputs, maintaining high in-distribution accuracy and low
computational overhead. Our experimental evaluation shows that C-EDL
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art EDL variants and competitive
baselines, achieving substantial reductions in coverage for OOD data (up to
55%) and adversarial data (up to 90%), across a range of datasets, attack

Abstract: While denoising diffusion and flow matching have driven major advances in
generative modeling, their application to tabular data remains limited, despite
its ubiquity in real-world applications. To this end, we develop TabbyFlow, a
variational Flow Matching (VFM) method for tabular data generation. To apply
VFM to data with mixed continuous and discrete features, we introduce
Exponential Family Variational Flow Matching (EF-VFM), which represents
heterogeneous data types using a general exponential family distribution. We
hereby obtain an efficient, data-driven objective based on moment matching,
enabling principled learning of probability paths over mixed continuous and
discrete variables. We also establish a connection between variational flow
matching and generalized flow matching objectives based on Bregman divergences.
Evaluation on tabular data benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
compared to baselines.

Method: 研究比较了树集成模型（如XGBoost、LightGBM）和神经网络（如N-BEATS、NHITS、Temporal Fusion Transformer），并评估了它们在零售数据上的表现。

Conclusion: 研究为零售环境中的模型选择提供了实践指导，并强调了数据预处理对提升预测性能的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting is key for all business planning. When estimated sales
are too high, brick-and-mortar retailers may incur higher costs due to unsold
inventories, higher labor and storage space costs, etc. On the other hand, when
forecasts underestimate the level of sales, firms experience lost sales,
shortages, and impact on the reputation of the retailer in their relevant
market. Accurate forecasting presents a competitive advantage for companies. It
facilitates the achievement of revenue and profit goals and execution of
pricing strategy and tactics. In this study, we provide an exhaustive
assessment of the forecasting models applied to a high-resolution
brick-and-mortar retail dataset. Our forecasting framework addresses the
problems found in retail environments, including intermittent demand, missing
values, and frequent product turnover. We compare tree-based ensembles (such as
XGBoost and LightGBM) and state-of-the-art neural network architectures
(including N-BEATS, NHITS, and the Temporal Fusion Transformer) across various
experimental settings. Our results show that localized modeling strategies
especially those using tree-based models on individual groups with non-imputed
data, consistently deliver superior forecasting accuracy and computational
efficiency. In contrast, neural models benefit from advanced imputation
methods, yet still fall short in handling the irregularities typical of
physical retail data. These results further practical understanding for model
selection in retail environment and highlight the significance of data
preprocessing to improve forecast performance.

Abstract: One-dimensional signal decomposition is a well-established and widely used
technique across various scientific fields. It serves as a highly valuable
pre-processing step for data analysis. While traditional decomposition
techniques often rely on mathematical models, recent research suggests that
applying the latest deep learning models to this problem presents an exciting,
unexplored area with promising potential. This work presents a novel method for
the additive decomposition of one-dimensional signals. We leverage the
Transformer architecture to decompose signals into their constituent
components: piece-wise constant, smooth (low-frequency oscillatory), textured
(high-frequency oscillatory), and a noise component. Our model, trained on
synthetic data, achieves excellent accuracy in modeling and decomposing input
signals from the same distribution, as demonstrated by the experimental
results.

Conclusion: C-PG在约束控制任务中表现优异，尤其是训练后部署确定性策略时。

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses sequential decision-making
problems where agents are required to achieve goals by maximizing the expected
return while meeting domain-specific constraints. In this setting, policy-based
methods are widely used thanks to their advantages when dealing with
continuous-control problems. These methods search in the policy space with an
action-based or a parameter-based exploration strategy, depending on whether
they learn the parameters of a stochastic policy or those of a stochastic
hyperpolicy. We introduce an exploration-agnostic algorithm, called C-PG, which
enjoys global last-iterate convergence guarantees under gradient domination
assumptions. Furthermore, under specific noise models where the (hyper)policy
is expressed as a stochastic perturbation of the actions or of the parameters
of an underlying deterministic policy, we additionally establish global
last-iterate convergence guarantees of C-PG to the optimal deterministic
policy. This holds when learning a stochastic (hyper)policy and subsequently
switching off the stochasticity at the end of training, thereby deploying a
deterministic policy. Finally, we empirically validate both the action-based
(C-PGAE) and parameter-based (C-PGPE) variants of C-PG on constrained control
tasks, and compare them against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating their
effectiveness, in particular when deploying deterministic policies after
training.

Conclusion: PrunE通过剪枝虚假边有效提升图神经网络的泛化能力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance
degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering
their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed
various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge,
with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an
invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue
that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging
and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong
correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first
pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD
generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, \mine{} retains the invariant
subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization.
Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges:
1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2)
$\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious
edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that
PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods significantly. Codes are available at:

Motivation: 扩散模型的大规模应用受限于高硬件资源需求，现有量化方法主要关注均匀标量量化，而向量量化在大型语言模型中已取得成功。

Method: 采用基于码本的加性向量量化方法对扩散模型进行压缩，并设计高效推理内核以实现FLOPs节省。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩散模型压缩提供了新的帕累托前沿，同时通过高效推理内核实现了广泛硬件支持下的资源节省。

Abstract: Significant investments have been made towards the commodification of
diffusion models for generation of diverse media. Their mass-market adoption is
however still hobbled by the intense hardware resource requirements of
diffusion model inference. Model quantization strategies tailored specifically
towards diffusion models have been useful in easing this burden, yet have
generally explored the Uniform Scalar Quantization (USQ) family of quantization
methods. In contrast, Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, which operate on groups
of multiple related weights as the basic unit of compression, have seen
substantial success in Large Language Model (LLM) quantization. In this work,
we apply codebook-based additive vector quantization to the problem of
diffusion model compression. Our resulting approach achieves a new Pareto
frontier for the extremely low-bit weight quantization on the standard
class-conditional benchmark of LDM-4 on ImageNet at 20 inference time steps.
Notably, we report sFID 1.92 points lower than the full-precision model at W4A8
and the best-reported results for FID, sFID and ISC at W2A8. We are also able
to demonstrate FLOPs savings on arbitrary hardware via an efficient inference
kernel, as opposed to savings resulting from small integer operations which may
lack broad hardware support.

Conclusion: 通过退火方法平衡贝尔曼最优算子的优势与偏差，显著提升了连续动作空间强化学习的效率和性能。

Abstract: For continuous action spaces, actor-critic methods are widely used in online
reinforcement learning (RL). However, unlike RL algorithms for discrete
actions, which generally model the optimal value function using the Bellman
optimality operator, RL algorithms for continuous actions typically model
Q-values for the current policy using the Bellman operator. These algorithms
for continuous actions rely exclusively on policy updates for improvement,
which often results in low sample efficiency. This study examines the
effectiveness of incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into
actor-critic frameworks. Experiments in a simple environment show that modeling
optimal values accelerates learning but leads to overestimation bias. To
address this, we propose an annealing approach that gradually transitions from
the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator, thereby accelerating
learning while mitigating bias. Our method, combined with TD3 and SAC,
significantly outperforms existing approaches across various locomotion and
manipulation tasks, demonstrating improved performance and robustness to
hyperparameters related to optimality.

Abstract: Long-range graph tasks -- those dependent on interactions between distant
nodes -- are an open problem in graph neural network research. Real-world
benchmark tasks, especially the Long Range Graph Benchmark, have become popular
for validating the long-range capability of proposed architectures. However,
this is an empirical approach that lacks both robustness and theoretical
underpinning; a more principled characterization of the long-range problem is
required. To bridge this gap, we formalize long-range interactions in graph
tasks, introduce a range measure for operators on graphs, and validate it with
synthetic experiments. We then leverage our measure to examine commonly used
tasks and architectures, and discuss to what extent they are, in fact,
long-range. We believe our work advances efforts to define and address the
long-range problem on graphs, and that our range measure will aid evaluation of
new datasets and architectures.

Abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (SBRL) enables rapid adaptation in
environments with sparse rewards by pretraining a skill-conditioned policy.
Effective skill learning requires jointly maximizing both exploration and skill
diversity. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously
optimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new
method, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill
Diversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both exploration and skill
diversification. We begin by conducting extensive ablation studies to identify
and define a set of objectives that effectively capture the aspects of
exploration and skill diversity, respectively. During the skill pretraining
phase, AMPED introduces a gradient surgery technique to balance the objectives
of exploration and skill diversity, mitigating conflicts and reducing reliance
on heuristic tuning. In the subsequent fine-tuning phase, AMPED incorporates a
skill selector module that dynamically selects suitable skills for downstream
tasks, based on task-specific performance signals. Our approach achieves
performance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. These
results highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and
diversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and
generalizable skill learning. Project Page: https://geonwoo.me/amped/

Abstract: A generalist agent must continuously learn and adapt throughout its lifetime,
achieving efficient forward transfer while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.
Previous work within the dominant pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning for single-task adaptation, effectively
steering a frozen pretrained model with a small number of parameters. However,
in the context of lifelong learning, these methods rely on the impractical
assumption of a test-time task identifier and restrict knowledge sharing among
isolated adapters. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Mixture of
Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library (DMPEL) for lifelong robot
learning. DMPEL progressively learn a low-rank expert library and employs a
lightweight router to dynamically combine experts into an end-to-end policy,
facilitating flexible behavior during lifelong adaptation. Moreover, by
leveraging the modular structure of the fine-tuned parameters, we introduce
coefficient replay to guide the router in accurately retrieving frozen experts
for previously encountered tasks, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
This method is significantly more storage- and computationally-efficient than
applying demonstration replay to the entire policy. Extensive experiments on
the lifelong manipulation benchmark LIBERO demonstrate that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods in success rates across
continual adaptation, while utilizing minimal trainable parameters and storage.

Conclusion: RETENTION有效减少CAM容量需求，为基于树的模型加速提供了资源高效的方向。

Abstract: Although deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning
from unstructured data, modern tree-based ensemble models remain superior in
extracting relevant information and learning from structured datasets. While
several efforts have been made to accelerate tree-based models, the inherent
characteristics of the models pose significant challenges for conventional
accelerators. Recent research leveraging content-addressable memory (CAM)
offers a promising solution for accelerating tree-based models, yet existing
designs suffer from excessive memory consumption and low utilization. This work
addresses these challenges by introducing RETENTION, an end-to-end framework
that significantly reduces CAM capacity requirement for tree-based model
inference. We propose an iterative pruning algorithm with a novel pruning
criterion tailored for bagging-based models (e.g., Random Forest), which
minimizes model complexity while ensuring controlled accuracy degradation.
Additionally, we present a tree mapping scheme that incorporates two innovative
data placement strategies to alleviate the memory redundancy caused by the
widespread use of don't care states in CAM. Experimental results show that
implementing the tree mapping scheme alone achieves $1.46\times$ to $21.30
\times$ better space efficiency, while the full RETENTION framework yields
$4.35\times$ to $207.12\times$ improvement with less than 3% accuracy loss.
These results demonstrate that RETENTION is highly effective in reducing CAM
capacity requirement, providing a resource-efficient direction for tree-based
model acceleration.

Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs), employing automation and machine learning (ML) to
accelerate experimental procedures, have enormous potential in the discovery of
new materials. However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to
solution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access
the broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL
based on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks,
obtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded
thin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to
systematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven
approach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and
sputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition
distribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ
measurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter
chamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of
the sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using
Gaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of
the deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of
the deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We
investigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully
Bayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best
performance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10
experiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions
was verified experimentally. Our framework dramatically increases throughput by
avoiding the need for extensive characterisation or calibration, thus
demonstrating the potential of ML-guided SDLs to accelerate materials
exploration.

Result: LaDEEP比有限元方法快五个数量级，精度相当，且比其他深度学习基线平均提升20.47%。

Conclusion: LaDEEP在真实工业系统中表现出色，为弹性-塑性固体大变形问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific computing for large deformation of elastic-plastic solids is
critical for numerous real-world applications. Classical numerical solvers rely
primarily on local discrete linear approximation and are constrained by an
inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Recently, deep learning
models have achieved impressive progress in solving the continuum mechanism.
While previous models have explored various architectures and constructed
coefficient-solution mappings, they are designed for general instances without
considering specific problem properties and hard to accurately handle with
complex elastic-plastic solids involving contact, loading and unloading. In
this work, we take stretch bending, a popular metal fabrication technique, as
our case study and introduce LaDEEP, a deep learning-based surrogate model for
\textbf{La}rge \textbf{De}formation of \textbf{E}lastic-\textbf{P}lastic
Solids. We encode the partitioned regions of the involved slender solids into a
token sequence to maintain their essential order property. To characterize the
physical process of the solid deformation, a two-stage Transformer-based module
is designed to predict the deformation with the sequence of tokens as input.
Empirically, LaDEEP achieves five magnitudes faster speed than finite element
methods with a comparable accuracy, and gains 20.47\% relative improvement on
average compared to other deep learning baselines. We have also deployed our
model into a real-world industrial production system, and it has shown
remarkable performance in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: 成员推断测试即使在放宽定义后仍不可靠，且存在准确性与鲁棒性的权衡问题。

Abstract: Membership inference tests aim to determine whether a particular data point
was included in a language model's training set. However, recent works have
shown that such tests often fail under the strict definition of membership
based on exact matching, and have suggested relaxing this definition to include
semantic neighbors as members as well. In this work, we show that membership
inference tests are still unreliable under this relaxation - it is possible to
poison the training dataset in a way that causes the test to produce incorrect
predictions for a target point. We theoretically reveal a trade-off between a
test's accuracy and its robustness to poisoning. We also present a concrete
instantiation of this poisoning attack and empirically validate its
effectiveness. Our results show that it can degrade the performance of existing
tests to well below random.

Abstract: Existing works on general time series forecasting build foundation models
with heavy model parameters through large-scale multi-source pre-training.
These models achieve superior generalization ability across various datasets at
the cost of significant computational burdens and limitations in
resource-constrained scenarios. This paper introduces LightGTS, a lightweight
general time series forecasting model designed from the perspective of
consistent periodical modeling. To handle diverse scales and intrinsic periods
in multi-source pre-training, we introduce Periodical Tokenization, which
extracts consistent periodic patterns across different datasets with varying
scales. To better utilize the periodicity in the decoding process, we further
introduce Periodical Parallel Decoding, which leverages historical tokens to
improve forecasting. Based on the two techniques above which fully leverage the
inductive bias of periods inherent in time series, LightGTS uses a lightweight
model to achieve outstanding performance on general time series forecasting. It
achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 9 real-world benchmarks in
both zero-shot and full-shot settings with much better efficiency compared with

Abstract: Multi-solid systems are foundational to a wide range of real-world
applications, yet modeling their complex interactions remains challenging.
Existing deep learning methods predominantly rely on implicit modeling, where
the factors influencing solid deformation are not explicitly represented but
are instead indirectly learned. However, as the number of solids increases,
these methods struggle to accurately capture intricate physical interactions.
In this paper, we introduce a novel explicit modeling paradigm that
incorporates factors influencing solid deformation through structured modules.
Specifically, we present Unisoma, a unified and flexible Transformer-based
model capable of handling variable numbers of solids. Unisoma directly captures
physical interactions using contact modules and adaptive interaction allocation
mechanism, and learns the deformation through a triplet relationship. Compared
to implicit modeling techniques, explicit modeling is more well-suited for
multi-solid systems with diverse coupling patterns, as it enables detailed
treatment of each solid while preventing information blending and confusion.
Experimentally, Unisoma achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across
seven well-established datasets and two complex multi-solid tasks. Code is

Conclusion: Do-PFN为因果效应估计提供了一种无需真实因果图的新方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Estimation of causal effects is critical to a range of scientific
disciplines. Existing methods for this task either require interventional data,
knowledge about the ground truth causal graph, or rely on assumptions such as
unconfoundedness, restricting their applicability in real-world settings. In
the domain of tabular machine learning, Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have
achieved state-of-the-art predictive performance, having been pre-trained on
synthetic data to solve tabular prediction problems via in-context learning. To
assess whether this can be transferred to the harder problem of causal effect
estimation, we pre-train PFNs on synthetic data drawn from a wide variety of
causal structures, including interventions, to predict interventional outcomes
given observational data. Through extensive experiments on synthetic case
studies, we show that our approach allows for the accurate estimation of causal
effects without knowledge of the underlying causal graph. We also perform
ablation studies that elucidate Do-PFN's scalability and robustness across
datasets with a variety of causal characteristics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ROBIN的新型学习模拟器，通过结合滚动扩散和分层图神经网络，解决了现有图基模拟器在捕捉全局现象和长期误差累积上的不足，并在多个力学基准测试中取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图基学习模拟器在模拟物理系统时难以捕捉全局现象（如弯曲或长程关联），且由于依赖局部消息传递和直接下一步预测，长期模拟中误差累积严重。

Method: ROBIN结合了两种创新技术：(i) 滚动扩散，一种并行化推理方案，通过在时间窗口内重叠去噪步骤来分摊扩散细化成本；(ii) 基于代数多重网格的分层图神经网络，支持多尺度消息传递。

Result: 在涉及几何、材料和接触非线性的2D和3D固体力学基准测试中，ROBIN实现了最先进的准确性，显著优于现有方法，并将推理时间减少了一个数量级。

Conclusion: ROBIN通过滚动扩散和分层图神经网络的结合，有效解决了现有模拟器的局限性，为复杂物理系统的模拟提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for
simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and
generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with
capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations, and
suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on
local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these
limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network
(ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i)
Rolling Diffusion, a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of
diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising
steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built
on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across
different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via
Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local
dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending
or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid
mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities.
ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially
outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference
time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的测试时优化方法，通过考虑分类器权重噪声的影响，生成更可靠的置信度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准不确定性估计技术（如dropout）难以清晰区分可靠与不可靠预测，主要由于分类器权重噪声的影响。

Method: 提出了一种测试时优化方法，定义单调子集选择函数，通过移除低分样本提高总体准确性。

Result: 在AUSE和AURC等标准风险指标中表现优异，能有效识别训练与测试分布差异，区分内外分布样本，并揭示CNN与ViT分类器的关键差异。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了置信度估计的可靠性，适用于多种视觉数据集。

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的机器遗忘定义——系统感知遗忘，旨在针对仅能访问系统存储数据的攻击者提供遗忘保证，而非传统定义中的最坏情况攻击者。通过选择性采样方法，提出了一种高效的线性分类系统感知遗忘算法，并分析了删除容量、准确性、内存和计算时间之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器遗忘定义要求更新后的模型与重新训练的模型几乎相同，这对最坏情况攻击者（能恢复所有剩余数据）提出了过高要求，导致算法开发困难且不切实际。因此，作者提出了一种更现实的系统感知遗忘定义。

Method: 提出系统感知遗忘定义，基于选择性采样方法设计了一种精确的线性分类系统感知遗忘算法，并将其推广到一般函数类的分类问题。

Result: 通过理论分析，展示了删除容量、准确性、内存和计算时间之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 系统感知遗忘定义更现实且高效，为机器遗忘算法的设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Machine unlearning addresses the problem of updating a machine learning
model/system trained on a dataset $S$ so that the influence of a set of
deletion requests $U \subseteq S$ on the unlearned model is minimized. The gold
standard definition of unlearning demands that the updated model, after
deletion, be nearly identical to the model obtained by retraining. This
definition is designed for a worst-case attacker (one who can recover not only
the unlearned model but also the remaining data samples, i.e., $S \setminus
U$). Such a stringent definition has made developing efficient unlearning
algorithms challenging. However, such strong attackers are also unrealistic. In
this work, we propose a new definition, system-aware unlearning, which aims to
provide unlearning guarantees against an attacker that can at best only gain
access to the data stored in the system for learning/unlearning requests and
not all of $S\setminus U$. With this new definition, we use the simple
intuition that if a system can store less to make its learning/unlearning
updates, it can be more secure and update more efficiently against a
system-aware attacker. Towards that end, we present an exact system-aware
unlearning algorithm for linear classification using a selective sampling-based
approach, and we generalize the method for classification with general function
classes. We theoretically analyze the tradeoffs between deletion capacity,
accuracy, memory, and computation time.

Motivation: 现有稀疏Transformer研究较少关注性能优化，且规则化机制无法适应不同序列长度和混合算子融合。

Method: 统一多头注意力的存储格式和内核实现，通过两阶段搜索引擎确定最佳参数设置。

Result: STOF在MHA计算和端到端推理中分别实现1.7倍和1.5倍的最大加速。

Conclusion: STOF有效解决了稀疏Transformer的性能优化问题，具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models are popular around the world due to their powerful
understanding capabilities. As the core component of LLMs, accelerating
Transformer through parallelization has gradually become a hot research topic.
Mask layers introduce sparsity into Transformer to reduce calculations.
However, previous works rarely focus on the performance optimization of sparse
Transformer. Moreover, rule-based mechanisms ignore the fusion opportunities of
mixed-type operators and fail to adapt to various sequence lengths. To address
the above problems, we propose STOF, a framework that incorporates
optimizations for Sparse Transformer via flexible masking and operator fusion
on GPU. We firstly unify the storage format and kernel implementation for the
multi-head attention. Then, we map fusion schemes to compilation templates and
determine the optimal parameter setting through a two-stage search engine. The
experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art work, STOF
achieves maximum speedups of 1.7x in MHA computation and 1.5x in end-to-end
inference.

Motivation: 传统微调方法需要大量数据和计算资源，且对超参数敏感。T2L旨在通过自然语言描述快速生成适配器，降低任务特定调整的门槛。

Method: T2L是一种超网络，通过训练生成LoRA适配器，仅需一次前向传播即可完成任务适配。

Result: T2L生成的适配器在多个任务上表现与专用适配器相当，并能压缩数百个适配器，零样本泛化到新任务。

Conclusion: T2L为大型语言模型的快速适配提供了高效解决方案，显著降低了计算需求。

Abstract: While Foundation Models provide a general tool for rapid content creation,
they regularly require task-specific adaptation. Traditionally, this exercise
involves careful curation of datasets and repeated fine-tuning of the
underlying model. Fine-tuning techniques enable practitioners to adapt
foundation models for many new applications but require expensive and lengthy
training while being notably sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Text-to-LoRA (T2L), a model capable of adapting
Large Language Models on the fly solely based on a natural language description
of the target task. T2L is a hypernetwork trained to construct LoRAs in a
single inexpensive forward pass. After training T2L on a suite of 9 pre-trained
LoRA adapters (GSM8K, Arc, etc.), we show that the ad-hoc reconstructed LoRA
instances match the performance of task-specific adapters across the
corresponding test sets. Furthermore, T2L can compress hundreds of LoRA
instances and zero-shot generalize to entirely unseen tasks. This approach
provides a significant step towards democratizing the specialization of
foundation models and enables language-based adaptation with minimal compute
requirements. Our code is available at https://github.com/SakanaAI/text-to-lora

Method: 提出Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM)框架，通过插值模型的泛化-拟合行为间隙来量化样本级遗忘效果。

Conclusion: IAM揭示了近似遗忘算法中过度遗忘和不足遗忘的风险，强调了加强近似遗忘系统安全性的必要性。

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy and security highlight the importance of
machine unlearning--removing specific data influences from trained models
without full retraining. Techniques like Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)
are widely used to externally assess successful unlearning. However, existing
methods face two key limitations: (1) maximizing MIA effectiveness (e.g., via
online attacks) requires prohibitive computational resources, often exceeding
retraining costs; (2) MIAs, designed for binary inclusion tests, struggle to
capture granular changes in approximate unlearning. To address these
challenges, we propose the Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM), a
framework natively designed for unlearning inference. IAM quantifies
sample-level unlearning completeness by interpolating the model's
generalization-fitting behavior gap on queried samples. IAM achieves strong
performance in binary inclusion tests for exact unlearning and high correlation
for approximate unlearning--scalable to LLMs using just one pre-trained shadow
model. We theoretically analyze how IAM's scoring mechanism maintains
performance efficiently. We then apply IAM to recent approximate unlearning
algorithms, revealing general risks of both over-unlearning and
under-unlearning, underscoring the need for stronger safeguards in approximate
unlearning systems. The code is available at

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection is critical for improving clustering
performance in high-dimensional data, where irrelevant features can obscure
meaningful structure. In this work, we introduce the Minkowski weighted
$k$-means++, a novel initialisation strategy for the Minkowski Weighted
$k$-means. Our initialisation selects centroids probabilistically using feature
relevance estimates derived from the data itself. Building on this, we propose
two new feature selection algorithms, FS-MWK++, which aggregates feature
weights across a range of Minkowski exponents to identify stable and
informative features, and SFS-MWK++, a scalable variant based on subsampling.
We support our approach with a theoretical guarantee under mild assumptions and
extensive experiments showing that our methods consistently outperform existing

Conclusion: 流注意力机制有效解决了流图数据中的守恒问题，提升了模型性能，并能区分标准注意力无法区分的非同构图。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for learning from
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs do not consider the conservation
law inherent in graphs associated with a flow of physical resources, such as
electrical current in power grids or traffic in transportation networks, which
can lead to reduced model performance. To address this, we propose flow
attention, which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy
Kirchhoff\'s first law. Furthermore, we discuss how this modification
influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can
be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention. Through
extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power
grids), we demonstrate that flow attention enhances the performance of
attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务深度学习（MTDL）中，任务间梯度冲突会阻碍损失函数的收敛，需要一种有效的方法来调整梯度轨迹。

Method: 提出SAM-GS方法，基于梯度幅值相似性度量，结合梯度均衡和一阶动量调制。

Result: 实验表明，SAM-GS在合成问题和MTL基准测试中表现有效。

Conclusion: 梯度幅值相似性在MTDL中对于优化学习过程具有重要作用。

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

Conclusion: Table-r1有效缩小了小语言模型与大语言模型在表格推理任务中的差距，展示了程序化方法的潜力。

Abstract: Table reasoning (TR) requires structured reasoning over semi-structured
tabular data and remains challenging, particularly for small language models
(SLMs, e.g., LLaMA-8B) due to their limited capacity compared to large LMs
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o). To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR),
which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical
reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs
introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts,
and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability.
We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1
introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation
Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view.
Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization,
enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed.
Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all
SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base
model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with
LLMs.

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) is crucial to develop well-performing
machine learning models. In order to ease prototyping and benchmarking of HPO
methods, we propose carps, a benchmark framework for Comprehensive Automated
Research Performance Studies allowing to evaluate N optimizers on M benchmark
tasks. In this first release of carps, we focus on the four most important
types of HPO task types: blackbox, multi-fidelity, multi-objective and
multi-fidelity-multi-objective. With 3 336 tasks from 5 community benchmark
collections and 28 variants of 9 optimizer families, we offer the biggest go-to
library to date to evaluate and compare HPO methods. The carps framework relies
on a purpose-built, lightweight interface, gluing together optimizers and
benchmark tasks. It also features an analysis pipeline, facilitating the
evaluation of optimizers on benchmarks. However, navigating a huge number of
tasks while developing and comparing methods can be computationally infeasible.
To address this, we obtain a subset of representative tasks by minimizing the
star discrepancy of the subset, in the space spanned by the full set. As a
result, we propose an initial subset of 10 to 30 diverse tasks for each task
type, and include functionality to re-compute subsets as more benchmarks become
available, enabling efficient evaluations. We also establish a first set of
baseline results on these tasks as a measure for future comparisons. With carps
(https://www.github.com/automl/CARP-S), we make an important step in the
standardization of HPO evaluation.

Abstract: Solving time-dependent parametric partial differential equations (PDEs)
remains a fundamental challenge for neural solvers, particularly when
generalizing across a wide range of physical parameters and dynamics. When data
is uncertain or incomplete-as is often the case-a natural approach is to turn
to generative models. We introduce ENMA, a generative neural operator designed
to model spatio-temporal dynamics arising from physical phenomena. ENMA
predicts future dynamics in a compressed latent space using a generative masked
autoregressive transformer trained with flow matching loss, enabling tokenwise
generation. Irregularly sampled spatial observations are encoded into uniform
latent representations via attention mechanisms and further compressed through
a spatio-temporal convolutional encoder. This allows ENMA to perform in-context
learning at inference time by conditioning on either past states of the target
trajectory or auxiliary context trajectories with similar dynamics. The result
is a robust and adaptable framework that generalizes to new PDE regimes and
supports one-shot surrogate modeling of time-dependent parametric PDEs.

Conclusion: 人类与AI的反馈循环可能导致观点固化，需警惕其对多样性和真理性的影响。

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback
loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these
beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them
back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We
hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs
of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false
beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based
LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but
sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations,
consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop. Code and data

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning
algorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. These
methods learn the parameters of parametric policies via stochastic gradient
ascent, typically using on-policy trajectory data to estimate the policy
gradient. However, such reliance on fresh data makes them sample-inefficient.
Indeed, vanilla PG methods require $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an
$\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve
efficiency is to reuse off-policy information from past iterations, such as
previous gradients or trajectories. While gradient reuse has received
substantial theoretical attention, leading to improved rates of
$O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories remains largely unexplored
from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous
theoretical evidence that extensive reuse of past off-policy trajectories can
significantly accelerate convergence in PG methods. We introduce a power mean
correction to the multiple importance weighting estimator and propose RPG
(Retrospective Policy Gradient), a PG algorithm that combines old and new
trajectories for policy updates. Through a novel analysis, we show that, under
established assumptions, RPG achieves a sample complexity of
$\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, the best known rate in the literature. We
further validate empirically our approach against PG methods with
state-of-the-art rates.

Result: 理论分析表明自注意力在训练中能学习交互函数并泛化到分布外场景。实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 自注意力是一种通用的交互学习器，新提出的模块进一步扩展了其建模能力。

Abstract: Self-attention has emerged as a core component of modern neural
architectures, yet its theoretical underpinnings remain elusive. In this paper,
we study self-attention through the lens of interacting entities, ranging from
agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning to alleles in genetic sequences,
and show that a single layer linear self-attention can efficiently represent,
learn, and generalize functions capturing pairwise interactions, including
out-of-distribution scenarios. Our analysis reveals that self-attention acts as
a mutual interaction learner under minimal assumptions on the diversity of
interaction patterns observed during training, thereby encompassing a wide
variety of real-world domains. In addition, we validate our theoretical
insights through experiments demonstrating that self-attention learns
interaction functions and generalizes across both population distributions and
out-of-distribution scenarios. Building on our theories, we introduce
HyperFeatureAttention, a novel neural network module designed to learn
couplings of different feature-level interactions between entities.
Furthermore, we propose HyperAttention, a new module that extends beyond
pairwise interactions to capture multi-entity dependencies, such as three-way,
four-way, or general n-way interactions.

Conclusion: 对称性研究为扩散模型提供了新的应用方向，且无需额外训练或计算开销。

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of antithetic initial noise in diffusion
models. Across unconditional models trained on diverse datasets,
text-conditioned latent-diffusion models, and diffusion-posterior samplers, we
find that pairing each initial noise with its negation consistently yields
strongly negatively correlated samples. To explain this phenomenon, we combine
experiments and theoretical analysis, leading to a symmetry conjecture that the
learned score function is approximately affine antisymmetric (odd symmetry up
to a constant shift), and provide evidence supporting it. Leveraging this
negative correlation, we enable two applications: (1) enhancing image diversity
in models like Stable Diffusion without quality loss, and (2) sharpening
uncertainty quantification (e.g., up to 90% narrower confidence intervals) when
estimating downstream statistics. Building on these gains, we extend the
two-point pairing to a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator, which further
improves estimation accuracy. Our framework is training-free, model-agnostic,
and adds no runtime overhead.

Result: PINC模型准确捕捉流体动态，支持实时控制，无需迭代求解器。

Conclusion: PINC为流体监控与优化提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: The modeling and control of single-phase flow systems governed by Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs) present challenges, especially under transient
conditions. In this work, we extend the Physics-Informed Neural Nets for
Control (PINC) framework, originally proposed to modeling and control of
Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) without the need of any labeled data, to
the PDE case, particularly to single-phase incompressible and compressible
flows, integrating neural networks with physical conservation laws. The PINC
model for PDEs is structured into two stages: a steady-state network, which
learns equilibrium solutions for a wide range of control inputs, and a
transient network, which captures dynamic responses under time-varying boundary
conditions. We propose a simplifying assumption that reduces the dimensionality
of the spatial coordinate regarding the initial condition, allowing the
efficient training of the PINC network. This simplification enables the
derivation of optimal control policies using Model Predictive Control (MPC). We
validate our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating that the
PINC model, which is trained exclusively using physical laws, i.e., without
labeled data, accurately represents flow dynamics and enables real-time control
applications. The results highlight the PINC's capability to efficiently
approximate PDE solutions without requiring iterative solvers, making it a
promising alternative for fluid flow monitoring and optimization in engineering
applications.

Conclusion: ICU-TSB为患者分层提供了可复现的评估工具，未来可进一步优化聚类标签的临床解释性。

Abstract: Patient stratification identifying clinically meaningful subgroups is
essential for advancing personalized medicine through improved diagnostics and
treatment strategies. Electronic health records (EHRs), particularly those from
intensive care units (ICUs), contain rich temporal clinical data that can be
leveraged for this purpose. In this work, we introduce ICU-TSB (Temporal
Stratification Benchmark), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
patient stratification based on temporal patient representation learning using
three publicly available ICU EHR datasets. A key contribution of our benchmark
is a novel hierarchical evaluation framework utilizing disease taxonomies to
measure the alignment of discovered clusters with clinically validated disease
groupings. In our experiments with ICU-TSB, we compared statistical methods and
several recurrent neural networks, including LSTM and GRU, for their ability to
generate effective patient representations for subsequent clustering of patient
trajectories. Our results demonstrate that temporal representation learning can
rediscover clinically meaningful patient cohorts; nevertheless, it remains a
challenging task, with v-measuring varying from up to 0.46 at the top level of
the taxonomy to up to 0.40 at the lowest level. To further enhance the
practical utility of our findings, we also evaluate multiple strategies for
assigning interpretable labels to the identified clusters. The experiments and
benchmark are fully reproducible and available at

Abstract: While conservation laws in gradient flow training dynamics are well
understood for (mostly shallow) ReLU and linear networks, their study remains
largely unexplored for more practical architectures. This paper bridges this
gap by deriving and analyzing conservation laws for modern architectures, with
a focus on convolutional ResNets and Transformer networks. For this, we first
show that basic building blocks such as ReLU (or linear) shallow networks, with
or without convolution, have easily expressed conservation laws, and no more
than the known ones. In the case of a single attention layer, we also
completely describe all conservation laws, and we show that residual blocks
have the same conservation laws as the same block without a skip connection. We
then introduce the notion of conservation laws that depend only on a subset of
parameters (corresponding e.g. to a pair of consecutive layers, to a residual
block, or to an attention layer). We demonstrate that the characterization of
such laws can be reduced to the analysis of the corresponding building block in
isolation. Finally, we examine how these newly discovered conservation
principles, initially established in the continuous gradient flow regime,
persist under discrete optimization dynamics, particularly in the context of
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

Conclusion: 这是首个在低保真稳态仿真中有效泛化于时变风况的深度强化学习尾流转向控制器。

Abstract: Within wind farms, wake effects between turbines can significantly reduce
overall energy production. Wind farm flow control encompasses methods designed
to mitigate these effects through coordinated turbine control. Wake steering,
for example, consists in intentionally misaligning certain turbines with the
wind to optimize airflow and increase power output. However, designing a robust
wake steering controller remains challenging, and existing machine learning
approaches are limited to quasi-static wind conditions or small wind farms.
This work presents a new deep reinforcement learning methodology to develop a
wake steering policy that overcomes these limitations. Our approach introduces
a novel architecture that combines graph attention networks and multi-head
self-attention blocks, alongside a novel reward function and training strategy.
The resulting model computes the yaw angles of each turbine, optimizing energy
production in time-varying wind conditions. An empirical study conducted on
steady-state, low-fidelity simulation, shows that our model requires
approximately 10 times fewer training steps than a fully connected neural
network and achieves more robust performance compared to a strong optimization
baseline, increasing energy production by up to 14 %. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first deep reinforcement learning-based wake steering
controller to generalize effectively across any time-varying wind conditions in
a low-fidelity, steady-state numerical simulation setting.

Motivation: 现有的图对比学习方法依赖手工设计的增强策略，未考虑数据分布和图形间的相似性，MGCL旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，MGCL达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 将生成模型融入图对比学习具有显著优势。

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{MGCL}$, a model-driven graph contrastive learning (GCL)
framework that leverages graphons (probabilistic generative models for graphs)
to guide contrastive learning by accounting for the data's underlying
generative process. GCL has emerged as a powerful self-supervised framework for
learning expressive node or graph representations without relying on annotated
labels, which are often scarce in real-world data. By contrasting augmented
views of graph data, GCL has demonstrated strong performance across various
downstream tasks, such as node and graph classification. However, existing
methods typically rely on manually designed or heuristic augmentation
strategies that are not tailored to the underlying data distribution and
operate at the individual graph level, ignoring similarities among graphs
generated from the same model. Conversely, in our proposed approach, MGCL first
estimates the graphon associated with the observed data and then defines a
graphon-informed augmentation process, enabling data-adaptive and principled
augmentations. Additionally, for graph-level tasks, MGCL clusters the dataset
and estimates a graphon per group, enabling contrastive pairs to reflect shared
semantics and structure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of incorporating generative models into GCL.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models accumulate errors due to their fixed,

accumulation by iteratively revisiting and potentially replacing tokens in a
window of previously generated text. This method can be integrated into
existing autoregressive models, preserving their next-token-prediction quality
and speed. Fine-tuning a pretrained 8B parameter model with RPT for only 100B
resulted in ~10% relative improvements on reasoning and coding benchmarks

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent mental health
condition, and a deeper understanding of its neurocognitive foundations is
essential for identifying how core functions such as emotional and
self-referential processing are affected. We investigate how depression alters
the temporal dynamics of emotional processing by measuring neural responses to
self-referential affective sentences using surface electroencephalography (EEG)
in healthy and depressed individuals. Our results reveal significant
group-level differences in neural activity during sentence viewing, suggesting
disrupted integration of emotional and self-referential information in
depression. Deep learning model trained on these responses achieves an area
under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.707 in distinguishing healthy
from depressed participants, and 0.624 in differentiating depressed subgroups
with and without suicidal ideation. Spatial ablations highlight anterior
electrodes associated with semantic and affective processing as key
contributors. These findings suggest stable, stimulus-driven neural signatures
of depression that may inform future diagnostic tools.

Result: GLEP生成多种学习算法，HEL是唯一具有硬件实现优势的特例。

Conclusion: GLEP为时变输入提供了理论框架，HEL因其高效性和局部学习特性成为硬件实现的理想选择。

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a learning algorithm for training
Energy-based Models (EBMs) on static inputs which leverages the variational
description of their fixed points. Extending EP to time-varying inputs is a
challenging problem, as the variational description must apply to the entire
system trajectory rather than just fixed points, and careful consideration of
boundary conditions becomes essential. In this work, we present Generalized
Lagrangian Equilibrium Propagation (GLEP), which extends the variational
formulation of EP to time-varying inputs. We demonstrate that GLEP yields
different learning algorithms depending on the boundary conditions of the
system, many of which are impractical for implementation. We then show that
Hamiltonian Echo Learning (HEL) -- which includes the recently proposed
Recurrent HEL (RHEL) and the earlier known Hamiltonian Echo Backpropagation
(HEB) algorithms -- can be derived as a special case of GLEP. Notably, HEL is
the only instance of GLEP we found that inherits the properties that make EP a
desirable alternative to backpropagation for hardware implementations: it
operates in a "forward-only" manner (i.e. using the same system for both
inference and learning), it scales efficiently (requiring only two or more
passes through the system regardless of model size), and enables local
learning.

Result: UNDO在计算成本和鲁棒性之间取得平衡，性能接近从头训练模型，但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: UNDO为实际应用中的鲁棒能力移除提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods are not robust: they can be reverted easily
with a few steps of finetuning. This is true even for the idealized unlearning
method of training to imitate an oracle model that was never exposed to
unwanted information, suggesting that output-based finetuning is insufficient
to achieve robust unlearning. In a similar vein, we find that training a
randomly initialized student to imitate an unlearned model transfers desired
behaviors while leaving undesired capabilities behind. In other words,
distillation robustifies unlearning. Building on this insight, we propose
Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an
unlearned model into a partially noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a
tunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto
frontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting,
UNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data
filtering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of
the pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies
unlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP)
benchmark. Since distillation is widely used in practice, incorporating an
unlearning step beforehand offers a convenient path to robust capability
removal.

Abstract: Diagnosing deep neural networks (DNNs) through the eigenspectrum of weight
matrices has been an active area of research in recent years. At a high level,
eigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the
empirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into
how well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better
layer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge
associated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of
weight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that
matrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias
in estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose
FARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the
weight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead
of measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD
of these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of
these submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the
aspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization
techniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of
weights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,
scientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model
(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly
improves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains. In one of
the LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model
by 17.3% when compared with the state-of-the-art method.

on the network dataplane to enable intelligent traffic analysis at line-speed.
However, the current use of the match-action table (MAT) abstraction on the
dataplane is misaligned with DL inference, leading to several key limitations,
including accuracy degradation, limited scale, and lack of generality. This
paper proposes Pegasus to address these limitations. Pegasus translates DL
operations into three dataplane-oriented primitives to achieve generality:
Partition, Map, and SumReduce. Specifically, Partition "divides"
high-dimensional features into multiple low-dimensional vectors, making them
more suitable for the dataplane; Map "conquers" computations on the
low-dimensional vectors in parallel with the technique of fuzzy matching, while
SumReduce "combines" the computation results. Additionally, Pegasus employs
Primitive Fusion to merge computations, improving scalability. Finally, Pegasus
adopts full precision weights with fixed-point activations to improve accuracy.
Our implementation on a P4 switch demonstrates that Pegasus can effectively
support various types of DL models, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and
AutoEncoder models on the dataplane. Meanwhile, Pegasus outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches with an average accuracy improvement of up to
22.8%, along with up to 248x larger model size and 212x larger input scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管相似性匹配成本函数在生物学上有明确解释并已成功应用于多个领域，但其完整的收敛性分析仍缺乏。

Method: 构建了一个由神经动态、侧向突触动态和前馈突触动态组成的生物合理网络，分别在不同时间尺度上运行，并通过多级优化框架分析其收敛性。

Result: 证明了在不同时间尺度上的动态收敛性，包括强凸性、强凹性以及全局最小值的几乎必然收敛。

Conclusion: 通过数值实验验证了方法的有效性，为生物合理的降维框架提供了理论支持。

Abstract: A recent breakthrough in biologically-plausible normative frameworks for
dimensionality reduction is based upon the similarity matching cost function
and the low-rank matrix approximation problem. Despite clear biological
interpretation, successful application in several domains, and experimental
validation, a formal complete convergence analysis remains elusive. Building on
this framework, we consider and analyze a continuous-time neural network, the
\emph{similarity matching network}, for principal subspace projection. Derived
from a min-max-min objective, this biologically-plausible network consists of
three coupled dynamics evolving at different time scales: neural dynamics,
lateral synaptic dynamics, and feedforward synaptic dynamics at the fast,
intermediate, and slow time scales, respectively. The feedforward and lateral
synaptic dynamics consist of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules,
respectively. By leveraging a multilevel optimization framework, we prove
convergence of the dynamics in the offline setting. Specifically, at the first
level (fast time scale), we show strong convexity of the cost function and
global exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics. At
the second level (intermediate time scale), we prove strong concavity of the
cost function and exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow
dynamics within the space of positive definite matrices. At the third and final
level (slow time scale), we study a non-convex and non-smooth cost function,
provide explicit expressions for its global minima, and prove almost sure
convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics to the global minima.
These results rely on two empirically motivated conjectures that are supported
by thorough numerical experiments. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of
our approach via a numerical example.

Conclusion: 该方法简单且广泛适用，有助于开发新的计算规律性发现方法。

Abstract: The development of science has been transforming man's view towards nature
for centuries. Observing structures and patterns in an effective approach to
discover regularities from data is a key step toward theory-building. With
increasingly complex data being obtained, revealing regularities systematically
has become a challenge. Correlation is a most commonly-used and effective
approach to describe regularities in data, yet for complex patterns, spatial
inhomogeneity and complexity can often undermine the correlations. We present
an algorithm to derive maps representing the type and degree of correlations,
by taking the two-fold symmetry of the correlation vector into full account
using the Stokes parameter. The method allows for a spatially resolved view of
the nature and strength of correlations between physical quantities. In the
correlation view, a region can often be separated into different subregions
with different types of correlations. Subregions correspond to physical regimes
for physical systems, or climate zones for climate maps. The simplicity of the
method makes it widely applicable to a variety of data, where the
correlation-based approach makes the map particularly useful in revealing
regularities in physical systems and alike. As a new and efficient approach to
represent data, the method should facilitate the development of new
computational approaches to regularity discovery.

TL;DR: MMTU是一个大规模基准测试，包含25个真实世界表格任务的30K问题，旨在全面评估模型在专家级别上理解、推理和操作表格的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对表格相关任务的评估有限，主要集中在NL-to-SQL和Table-QA等任务，忽略了专业用户面临的更广泛任务，限制了模型在这一领域的发展。

Method: MMTU基于数十年的计算机科学研究，设计了25个复杂表格任务，涵盖表格理解、推理和编码等技能。

Result: 当前前沿模型（如OpenAI o4-mini和DeepSeek R1）在MMTU上的表现仅为60%左右，显示仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: MMTU为结构化数据处理和分析的基础模型提供了全面评估工具，有望推动该领域的进一步进展。

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important
real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational
notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers,
data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown
remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database
copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains
limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,
evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like
NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks
that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model
progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K
questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively
evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at
the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science
research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by
professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills --
including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging
for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI
o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for
improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope
that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing
foundation models for structured data processing and analysis. Our code and
data are available at https://github.com/MMTU-Benchmark/MMTU and

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于逻辑推理的学习与规划框架，取代传统的基于奖励的优化方法，确保决策的逻辑有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法依赖概率探索，可能导致不安全或无效的过渡，而逻辑推理方法能提供可验证的预条件支持。

Method: 将动作、状态转换和目标表示为逻辑命题，通过直觉逻辑构建构造性证明，确保决策的正确性。

Result: 在结构化网格世界中，该方法实现了完美的安全性、可解释行为和高效收敛，无无效动作。

Conclusion: 为强化学习提供了一种基于逻辑和证明理论的新方向，适用于安全规划和可信AI。

Abstract: We introduce a novel learning and planning framework that replaces
traditional reward-based optimisation with constructive logical inference. In
our model, actions, transitions, and goals are represented as logical
propositions, and decision-making proceeds by building constructive proofs
under intuitionistic logic. This method ensures that state transitions and
policies are accepted only when supported by verifiable preconditions --
eschewing probabilistic trial-and-error in favour of guaranteed logical
validity. We implement a symbolic agent operating in a structured gridworld,
where reaching a goal requires satisfying a chain of intermediate subgoals
(e.g., collecting keys to open doors), each governed by logical constraints.
Unlike conventional reinforcement learning agents, which require extensive
exploration and suffer from unsafe or invalid transitions, our constructive
agent builds a provably correct plan through goal chaining, condition tracking,
and knowledge accumulation. Empirical comparison with Q-learning demonstrates
that our method achieves perfect safety, interpretable behaviour, and efficient
convergence with no invalid actions, highlighting its potential for safe
planning, symbolic cognition, and trustworthy AI. This work presents a new
direction for reinforcement learning grounded not in numeric optimisation, but
in constructive logic and proof theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在评估时需要设计外部奖励函数，而环境中某些状态（如死亡）无法提供直接反馈，限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 采用记忆增强神经网络（MANN）架构生成内在奖励函数，模拟恐惧条件行为，并在Miniworld Sidewalk环境中验证。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效避免终端状态探索，产生类似恐惧条件的行为，并可调整阈值模拟广泛性焦虑障碍（GADs）行为。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种生物启发的神经网络架构和恐惧条件范式框架，能解决非描述性终端条件环境中的问题。

Abstract: Biological and psychological concepts have inspired reinforcement learning
algorithms to create new complex behaviors that expand agents' capacity. These
behaviors can be seen in the rise of techniques like goal decomposition,
curriculum, and intrinsic rewards, which have paved the way for these complex
behaviors. One limitation in evaluating these methods is the requirement for
engineered extrinsic for realistic environments. A central challenge in
engineering the necessary reward function(s) comes from these environments
containing states that carry high negative rewards, but provide no feedback to
the agent. Death is one such stimuli that fails to provide direct feedback to
the agent. In this work, we introduce an intrinsic reward function inspired by
early amygdala development and produce this intrinsic reward through a novel
memory-augmented neural network (MANN) architecture. We show how this intrinsic
motivation serves to deter exploration of terminal states and results in
avoidance behavior similar to fear conditioning observed in animals.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how modifying a threshold where the fear response
is active produces a range of behaviors that are described under the paradigm
of general anxiety disorders (GADs). We demonstrate this behavior in the
Miniworld Sidewalk environment, which provides a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) and a sparse reward with a non-descriptive terminal
condition, i.e., death. In effect, this study results in a
biologically-inspired neural architecture and framework for fear conditioning
paradigms; we empirically demonstrate avoidance behavior in a constructed agent
that is able to solve environments with non-descriptive terminal conditions.

Motivation: 传统偏好学习方法在聚合多评估者偏好时可能偏向广泛持有的意见，导致政策偏见。本文旨在开发一种能比例对齐真实评估者偏好分布的新框架。

Method: 通过成对比较数据推断评估者人口分布，构建满足社会选择理论公理（单调性和帕累托效率）及新引入的公理（比例代表和人口边界鲁棒性）的政策。采用软最大松弛方法平衡比例代表与Condorcet胜者选择。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在表格推荐任务和大规模语言模型对齐中的有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 新框架成功解决了传统偏好学习中的偏见问题，并通过实验验证了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Conventional preference learning methods often prioritize opinions held more
widely when aggregating preferences from multiple evaluators. This may result
in policies that are biased in favor of some types of opinions or groups. The
objective of this paper is to develop a novel preference learning framework
capable of aligning aggregate opinions and policies proportionally with the
true population distribution of evaluator preferences. Our approach infers the
feasible set of evaluator population distributions directly from pairwise
comparison data. Using these estimates, the algorithm constructs a policy that
satisfies foundational axioms from social choice theory, namely monotonicity
and Pareto efficiency, as well as our newly-introduced axioms of
population-proportional representation and population-bounded robustness. We
propose a soft-max relaxation method that smoothly trade-offs
population-proportional representation with the selection of the Condorcet
winner (which beats all other options in pairwise comparisons). Finally, we
validate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach through experiments
on both tabular recommendation tasks and large-scale language model alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPRINT是一个后训练和推理时框架，旨在通过并行化减少大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理时间，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但通常生成冗长的顺序思维链，导致推理时间过长。SPRINT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SPRINT通过数据重组和微调，使模型能够动态识别并行化机会，并在推理过程中并行执行独立子任务。

Result: 实验表明，SPRINT在数学等复杂领域保持性能的同时，减少了39%的顺序令牌生成。在GPQA和Countdown任务中，分别减少了45%和65%的顺序令牌。

Conclusion: SPRINT有效减少了推理时间，同时保持了模型的性能，适用于需要长推理链的任务。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but typically
generate lengthy sequential chains-of-thought, resulting in long inference
times before arriving at the final answer. To address this challenge, we
introduce SPRINT, a novel post-training and inference-time framework designed
to enable LRMs to dynamically identify and exploit opportunities for
parallelization during their reasoning process. SPRINT incorporates an
innovative data curation pipeline that reorganizes natural language reasoning
trajectories into structured rounds of long-horizon planning and parallel
execution. By fine-tuning LRMs on a small amount of such curated data, the
models learn to dynamically identify independent subtasks within extended
reasoning processes and effectively execute them in parallel. Through extensive
evaluations, we show that the models fine-tuned with the SPRINT framework match
the performance of reasoning models on complex domains such as mathematics
while generating up to ~39% fewer sequential tokens on problems requiring more
than 8000 output tokens. Finally, we observe consistent results transferred to
two out-of-distribution tasks of GPQA and Countdown with up to 45% and 65%
reduction in average sequential tokens for longer reasoning trajectories, while
achieving the performance of the fine-tuned reasoning model.

Motivation: 现有约束解码方法会扭曲模型分布，影响多样性，尤其在程序模糊测试中需要多样且有效的输入。

Method: 构建有效输出的提议分布，应用基于LM似然的Metropolis-Hastings接受准则。

Result: 在合成基准和实际程序模糊测试任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新框架在满足约束的同时高效探索约束空间，提升了样本质量。

Abstract: Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that
provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding
approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that
is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants
to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a
new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying
(every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling
process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient
(high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal
distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient
exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms
existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing
tasks.

Abstract: Reward modelling from preference data is a crucial step in aligning large
language models (LLMs) with human values, requiring robust generalisation to
novel prompt-response pairs. In this work, we propose to frame this problem in
a causal paradigm, providing the rich toolbox of causality to identify the
persistent challenges, such as causal misidentification, preference
heterogeneity, and confounding due to user-specific factors. Inheriting from
the literature of causal inference, we identify key assumptions necessary for
reliable generalisation and contrast them with common data collection
practices. We illustrate failure modes of naive reward models and demonstrate
how causally-inspired approaches can improve model robustness. Finally, we
outline desiderata for future research and practices, advocating targeted
interventions to address inherent limitations of observational data.

Motivation: 当前LLM代理缺乏灵活性，无法满足用户多样化需求，因此开发了PersonaAgent以实现个性化任务。

Result: 实验表明，PersonaAgent在个性化行动空间和实时应用中表现优异。

Conclusion: PersonaAgent展示了动态个性化用户体验的可行性和潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents have recently emerged as advanced
paradigms that exhibit impressive capabilities in a wide range of domains and
tasks. Despite their potential, current LLM agents often adopt a
one-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users'
varying needs and preferences. This limitation motivates us to develop
PersonaAgent, the first personalized LLM agent framework designed to address
versatile personalization tasks. Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two
complementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic
and semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the
agent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona
(defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary:
it leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while
the outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the
framework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that
simulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring
real-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between
simulated and ground-truth responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
PersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only
personalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time
real-world applications. These results underscore the feasibility and potential
of our approach in delivering tailored, dynamic user experiences.

Motivation: 离线强化学习在在线探索成本高或不安全时至关重要，但常因数据有限而面临高认知不确定性，现有方法依赖固定保守策略，限制了适应性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出Reflect-then-Plan（RefPlan），通过实时观测更新环境动态的信念，将不确定性纳入模型规划中，实现贝叶斯后验估计。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，RefPlan显著提升了保守离线强化学习策略的性能，在高认知不确定性和有限数据下保持稳健，并对环境动态变化具有韧性。

Conclusion: RefPlan提高了离线学习策略的灵活性、泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial when online exploration is
costly or unsafe but often struggles with high epistemic uncertainty due to
limited data. Existing methods rely on fixed conservative policies, restricting
adaptivity and generalization. To address this, we propose Reflect-then-Plan
(RefPlan), a novel doubly Bayesian offline model-based (MB) planning approach.
RefPlan unifies uncertainty modeling and MB planning by recasting planning as
Bayesian posterior estimation. At deployment, it updates a belief over
environment dynamics using real-time observations, incorporating uncertainty
into MB planning via marginalization. Empirical results on standard benchmarks
show that RefPlan significantly improves the performance of conservative
offline RL policies. In particular, RefPlan maintains robust performance under
high epistemic uncertainty and limited data, while demonstrating resilience to
changing environment dynamics, improving the flexibility, generalizability, and
robustness of offline-learned policies.

Abstract: Signal restoration and inverse problems are key elements in most real-world
data science applications. In the past decades, with the emergence of machine
learning methods, inversion of measurements has become a popular step in almost
all physical applications, which is normally executed prior to downstream tasks
that often involve parameter estimation. In this work, we analyze the general
problem of parameter estimation in an inverse problem setting. First, we
address the domain-shift problem by re-formulating it in direct relation with
the discrete parameter estimation analysis. We analyze a significant
vulnerability in current attempts to enforce domain generalization, which we
dubbed the Double Meaning Theorem. Our theoretical findings are experimentally
illustrated for domain shift examples in image deblurring and speckle
suppression in medical imaging. We then proceed to a theoretical analysis of
parameter estimation given observed measurements before and after data
processing involving an inversion of the observations. We compare this setting
for invertible and non-invertible (degradation) processes. We distinguish
between continuous and discrete parameter estimation, corresponding with
regression and classification problems, respectively. Our theoretical findings
align with the well-known information-theoretic data processing inequality, and
to a certain degree question the common misconception that data-processing for
inversion, based on modern generative models that may often produce outstanding
perceptual quality, will necessarily improve the following parameter estimation
objective. It is our hope that this paper will provide practitioners with
deeper insights that may be leveraged in the future for the development of more
efficient and informed strategic system planning, critical in safety-sensitive
applications.

Motivation: 随着机器学习的发展，确保模型公平性变得至关重要，以避免对特定群体（如种族、性别或年龄）产生偏见，从而加剧结构性不平等。

Method: {fairmetrics} R包提供了一个用户友好的框架，用于评估多种基于群体的公平性标准，包括独立性、分离性和充分性等指标。

Conclusion: {fairmetrics}为机器学习模型的公平性评估提供了实用工具，有助于识别和缓解潜在的偏见。

Abstract: Fairness is a growing area of machine learning (ML) that focuses on ensuring
models do not produce systematically biased outcomes for specific groups,
particularly those defined by protected attributes such as race, gender, or
age. Evaluating fairness is a critical aspect of ML model development, as
biased models can perpetuate structural inequalities. The {fairmetrics} R
package offers a user-friendly framework for rigorously evaluating numerous
group-based fairness criteria, including metrics based on independence (e.g.,
statistical parity), separation (e.g., equalized odds), and sufficiency (e.g.,
predictive parity). Group-based fairness criteria assess whether a model is
equally accurate or well-calibrated across a set of predefined groups so that
appropriate bias mitigation strategies can be implemented. {fairmetrics}
provides both point and interval estimates for multiple metrics through a
convenient wrapper function and includes an example dataset derived from the
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version II (MIMIC-II) database
(Goldberger et al., 2000; Raffa, 2016).

Abstract: During the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the educational paradigm has
experienced a major change from in person learning traditional to online
platforms. The change of learning convention has impacted the teacher-student
especially in non-verbal communication. The absent of non-verbal communication
has led to a reliance on verbal feedback which diminished the efficacy of the
educational experience. This paper explores the integration of sentiment
analysis into learning management systems (LMS) to bridge the student-teacher's
gap by offering an alternative approach to interpreting student feedback beyond
its verbal context. The research involves data preparation, feature selection,

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合人类监督与计算方法的框架（CGT），用于分析大规模定性数据，同时保持传统扎根理论的严谨性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大数据时代下，传统定性分析方法难以应对大规模数据集，且计算工具的结果可信度存疑。

Method: 提出'人机协同'的CGT框架，结合ML和NLP工具，同时保留研究者对分析过程的控制。

Result: 通过Reddit数据集测试，验证了CGT框架在理解零工经济中导师体验的有效性。

Conclusion: CGT框架为大规模定性数据分析提供了可信且高效的方法，同时兼顾了计算工具的自动化优势与人类研究的严谨性。

Abstract: The availability of big data has significantly influenced the possibilities
and methodological choices for conducting large-scale behavioural and social
science research. In the context of qualitative data analysis, a major
challenge is that conventional methods require intensive manual labour and are
often impractical to apply to large datasets. One effective way to address this
issue is by integrating emerging computational methods to overcome scalability
limitations. However, a critical concern for researchers is the trustworthiness
of results when Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools are used to analyse such data. We argue that confidence in the
credibility and robustness of results depends on adopting a 'human-in-the-loop'
methodology that is able to provide researchers with control over the
analytical process, while retaining the benefits of using ML and NLP. With this
in mind, we propose a novel methodological framework for Computational Grounded
Theory (CGT) that supports the analysis of large qualitative datasets, while
maintaining the rigour of established Grounded Theory (GT) methodologies. To
illustrate the framework's value, we present the results of testing it on a
dataset collected from Reddit in a study aimed at understanding tutors'
experiences in the gig economy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在电子商务中生成产品描述时的性别偏见，提出了新的分类方法，并分析了GPT-3.5和电商专用LLM中的偏见表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM的性别偏见在许多领域已被广泛研究，但在电子商务中的应用尚未深入探讨，可能揭示新的算法偏见和危害。

Method: 开发了数据驱动的性别偏见分类方法，并定量分析了GPT-3.5和电商专用LLM中的偏见表现。

Result: 研究发现电商场景中存在独特的性别偏见形式，如服装尺寸假设、产品特征刻板印象和说服性语言差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了电子商务中未充分探索的性别偏见维度，补充了对排斥性规范、刻板印象和性能差异的理解。

Abstract: While gender bias in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively
studied in many domains, uses of LLMs in e-commerce remain largely unexamined
and may reveal novel forms of algorithmic bias and harm. Our work investigates
this space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the
context of product description generation, which we situate with respect to
existing general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated
product descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require
specialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively
analyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for
this task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these
forms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique,
under-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing
size, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and
differences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our
understanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks:
exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for
the context of e-commerce.

TL;DR: TGTalker是一种新型的时序图学习框架，专为LLMs设计，用于动态图预测，并在真实世界网络中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在图推理方面取得了进展，但其在动态图（真实世界演化网络）中的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: TGTalker利用时序图的近期偏差提取结构信息，并将其转换为自然语言供LLMs使用，同时利用时序邻居作为预测的额外信息。

Result: 在五个真实世界网络中，TGTalker与现有TGNN模型相比表现出竞争力，并优于TGN和HTGN等流行模型。

Conclusion: TGTalker不仅提升了动态图预测性能，还通过生成预测的文本解释，为时序链路预测的可解释性开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in
Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range
of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including
their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs --
real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work
studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but
applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To
address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel
temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the
recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information,
converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as
additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link
prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network
(TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively
with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming
popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual
explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in
explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/shenyangHuang/TGTalker.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在4位量化中存在大量激活异常值，导致量化精度下降，SmoothRot旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SmoothRot结合通道级缩放和Hadamard变换，将极端异常值转化为适合量化的激活值。

Result: 在LLaMA2 7B、LLaMA3.1 8B和Mistral 7B等模型上的实验表明，SmoothRot将量化模型与FP16模型的性能差距缩小了10-30%，且不增加推理延迟。

Conclusion: SmoothRot是一种高效的后训练量化技术，显著提升了4位量化在LLMs中的性能。

Abstract: We present SmoothRot, a novel post-training quantization technique to enhance
the efficiency of 4-bit quantization in Large Language Models (LLMs). SmoothRot
addresses the critical challenge of massive activation outliers, by integrating
channel-wise scaling with Hadamard transformations. Our technique effectively
transforms extreme outliers into quantization-friendly activations,
significantly improving quantization accuracy. Experiments conducted on popular
LLMs (LLaMA2 7B, LLaMA3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B) demonstrate that SmoothRot
consistently reduces the performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by
approximately 10-30\% across language generation and zero-shot reasoning tasks,
without introducing additional inference latency. Code is available at

TL;DR: 该研究使用无监督机器学习技术分析儿童语言发展轨迹，发现特定语言障碍（SLI）主要表现为语言产出能力下降而非句法复杂性缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统诊断方法可能忽略细微发展模式，研究旨在通过无监督学习技术为早期识别和干预提供新视角。

Method: 分析1,163名4-16岁儿童的语言样本，使用主成分分析（PCA）和聚类技术评估64个语言特征。

Result: 发现两个主要聚类：高产低SLI组和低产高句法复杂性高SLI组，支持语言能力的连续性模型。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了传统分类诊断框架，展示了无监督学习在优化诊断和干预策略中的潜力。

Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7 percent of
children, presenting as isolated language deficits despite normal cognitive
abilities, sensory systems, and supportive environments. Traditional diagnostic
approaches often rely on standardized assessments, which may overlook subtle
developmental patterns. This study aims to identify natural language
development trajectories in children with and without SLI using unsupervised
machine learning techniques, providing insights for early identification and
targeted interventions. Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years
across three corpora (Conti-Ramsden 4, ENNI, and Gillam) were analyzed using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. A total of 64 linguistic
features were evaluated to uncover developmental trajectories and distinguish
linguistic profiles. Two primary clusters emerged: (1) high language production
with low SLI prevalence, and (2) limited production but higher syntactic
complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Additionally, boundary cases exhibited
intermediate traits, supporting a continuum model of language abilities.
Findings suggest SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity
rather than syntactic complexity deficits. The results challenge categorical
diagnostic frameworks and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning
techniques for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

Motivation: 理解语言模型如何记忆训练数据中的事实和逐字序列，以改进其知识利用能力。

Method: 构建合成数据集，包含虚构事件的文本和问答对，通过训练实验分析记忆行为。

Result: 合成数据能有效区分不同记忆形式，但构建真实虚构数据存在挑战。

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究语言模型记忆机制提供了新工具，同时揭示了合成数据的局限性。

Abstract: When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge
about the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world.
At inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve
interesting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well
known that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their
training data. However, it is much less well understood how language models
memorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to
specifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact
memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of
synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well
as question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments
showing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing
apart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in
effectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于渐进式过载原则的课程学习框架（POCL），用于改进大型语言模型的知识蒸馏（KD），通过逐步增加训练样本难度，提升学生模型的稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KD方法在训练过程中容易导致学生模型分布偏移，引发灾难性遗忘、模式崩溃等问题，需要一种更稳定的训练策略。

Method: POCL框架包含两个核心组件：难度测量器（对样本从易到难排序）和训练调度器（逐步引入样本并调整损失函数温度）。

Result: 实验表明，POCL能显著提升蒸馏后学生模型的性能，适用于多种KD方法和模型家族。

Conclusion: POCL通过结构化训练数据，有效提升了KD过程的稳定性和模型性能，为LLM的压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将结构化数据转换为文本序列，忽略了关键关系结构且效率低下，需要一种能保留关系结构的方法。

Method: 使用GNN编码器提取实体局部子图，生成包含关系和时序依赖的特征表示，并通过反规范化转换为结构化提示。

Result: 实验表明，Rel-LLM在关系深度学习任务上优于现有方法，具有可扩展性和高效性。

Conclusion: Rel-LLM为LLMs与结构化数据源的集成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL)
remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational
links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into
flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical
relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM
context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a
graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational
prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.
Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves
the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to
effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,
the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature
representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal
dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts
using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over
relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and
efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources. Code is
available at https://github.com/smiles724/Rel-LLM.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注显式事实的孤立移除，忽略了潜在推理依赖和知识的非确定性，导致遗忘效果被高估。

Method: 提出知识遗忘评估框架，利用知识图谱表示事实上下文，并通过LLM推理评估遗忘效果。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能更真实、严格地评估遗忘性能，并发现现有策略高估了遗忘效果。

Conclusion: 该框架为知识遗忘提供了更可靠的评估方法，揭示了当前评估策略的局限性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in
large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus
on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential
dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs.
Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through
correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge
unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit
structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as
knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an
inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these
judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning
success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated
against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability.
Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our
framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning
performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies
tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Graph-COM/Knowledge_Unlearning.git.

Motivation: 随着LLM生成代码的普及，检测其来源对安全、知识产权和学术诚信至关重要。研究发现，仅从代码本身难以区分来源，但结合任务条件可显著提高检测效果。

Method: 提出ATC方法，通过近似生成代码的任务条件，评估代码标记的熵值差异。无需生成模型或原始任务提示，适用于实际场景。

Result: ATC在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，并能泛化至Python、CPP和Java等多种编程语言。

Conclusion: 任务条件对LLM生成代码检测至关重要，ATC方法为实际应用提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code is a growing challenge
with implications for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.
We investigate the role of conditional probability distributions in improving
zero-shot LLM-generated code detection, when considering both the code and the
corresponding task prompt that generated it. Our key insight is that when
evaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is
little difference between LLM-generated and human-written code. However,
conditioning on the task reveals notable differences. This contrasts with
natural language text, where differences exist even in the unconditional
distributions. Leveraging this, we propose a novel zero-shot detection approach
that approximates the original task used to generate a given code snippet and
then evaluates token-level entropy under the approximated task conditioning
(ATC). We further provide a mathematical intuition, contextualizing our method
relative to previous approaches. ATC requires neither access to the generator
LLM nor the original task prompts, making it practical for real-world
applications. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves state-of-the-art
results across benchmarks and generalizes across programming languages,
including Python, CPP, and Java. Our findings highlight the importance of
task-level conditioning for LLM-generated code detection. The supplementary
materials and code are available at https://github.com/maorash/ATC, including
the dataset gathering implementation, to foster further research in this area.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cartridge的替代方案，通过离线训练较小的KV缓存来降低推理时的内存消耗和成本，同时通过自学习训练方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在处理长上下文时内存消耗高且成本昂贵，需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出Cartridge方法，通过离线训练KV缓存，并使用自学习（生成合成对话并训练）来优化性能。

Result: Cartridge在性能上与ICL相当，但内存消耗减少38.6倍，吞吐量提升26.4倍，并扩展了有效上下文长度。

Conclusion: Cartridge结合自学习方法是一种高效且经济的替代方案，适用于长上下文任务。

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text
corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the
entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL).
Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is
costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with
input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on
each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a
Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge
can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,
we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token
prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose
self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations
about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.
We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of
ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context
benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while
using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also
extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on
MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference
time without retraining.

Motivation: 传统训练算法在二元神经网络（BiNNs）训练中存在局限性，量子计算提供了新的优化途径。

Method: 采用变分量子算法生成二进制权重，结合贝叶斯推理中的证据下界（ELBO）和最大均值差异（MMD）指标。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于传统的最大似然估计（MLE），提升了训练性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 量子超网络为BiNNs的优化提供了有效的新方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BiNNs), which employ single-bit precision weights,
have emerged as a promising solution to reduce memory usage and power
consumption while maintaining competitive performance in large-scale systems.
However, training BiNNs remains a significant challenge due to the limitations
of conventional training algorithms. Quantum HyperNetworks offer a novel
paradigm for enhancing the optimization of BiNN by leveraging quantum
computing. Specifically, a Variational Quantum Algorithm is employed to
generate binary weights through quantum circuit measurements, while key quantum
phenomena such as superposition and entanglement facilitate the exploration of
a broader solution space. In this work, we establish a connection between this
approach and Bayesian inference by deriving the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO),
when direct access to the output distribution is available (i.e., in
simulations), and introducing a surrogate ELBO based on the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) metric for scenarios involving implicit distributions, as
commonly encountered in practice. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed methods outperform standard Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE),
improving trainability and generalization.

Abstract: A possible path to the interpretability of neural networks is to
(approximately) represent them in the regional format of piecewise linear
functions, where regions of inputs are associated to linear functions computing
the network outputs. We present an algorithm for the translation of feedforward
neural networks with ReLU activation functions in hidden layers and truncated
identity activation functions in the output layer. We also empirically
investigate the complexity of regional representations outputted by our method
for neural networks with varying sizes. Lattice and logical representations of
neural networks are straightforward from regional representations as long as
they satisfy a specific property. So we empirically investigate to what extent
the translations by our algorithm satisfy such property.

Result: 实现了O(log log n)的近似因子，显著优于之前的O(log n / log log n)。

Conclusion: 该机制为一般次可加估值函数提供了更高效的预算可行解决方案。

Abstract: In budget-feasible mechanism design, there is a set of items $U$, each owned
by a distinct seller. The seller of item $e$ incurs a private cost
$\overline{c}_e$ for supplying her item. A buyer wishes to procure a set of
items from the sellers of maximum value, where the value of a set $S\subseteq
U$ of items is given by a valuation function $v:2^U\to \mathbb{R}_+$. The buyer
has a budget of $B \in \mathbb{R}_+$ for the total payments made to the
sellers. We wish to design a mechanism that is truthful, that is, sellers are
incentivized to report their true costs, budget-feasible, that is, the sum of
the payments made to the sellers is at most the budget $B$, and that outputs a
set whose value is large compared to $\text{OPT}:=\max\{v(S):\overline{c}(S)\le
B,S\subseteq U\}$.
  Budget-feasible mechanism design has been extensively studied, with the
literature focussing on (classes of) subadditive valuation functions, and
various polytime, budget-feasible mechanisms, achieving constant-factor
approximation, have been devised for the special cases of additive, submodular,
and XOS valuations. However, for general subadditive valuations, the best-known
approximation factor achievable by a polytime budget-feasible mechanism (given
access to demand oracles) was only $O(\log n / \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the
number of items.
  We improve this state-of-the-art significantly by designing a budget-feasible
mechanism for subadditive valuations that \emph{achieves a
substantially-improved approximation factor of $O(\log\log n)$ and runs in
polynomial time, given access to demand oracles.}

Motivation: 现实市场中，参与者难以提供完整的偏好列表，需探讨其对匹配结果的影响。

Method: 采用序列独裁机制，假设学生偏好列表长度为d，随机从n所学校中均匀采样。

Result: 学生偏好较长列表，学校始终偏好较长列表；列表长度d影响学生匹配学校的排名。

Conclusion: 在需求不超过供给的市场中，应设计尽可能长的偏好列表，以利于所有参与者。

Abstract: Many centralized mechanisms for two-sided matching markets that enjoy strong
theoretical properties assume that the planner solicits full information on the
preferences of each participating agent. In particular, they expect that
participants compile and communicate their complete preference lists over
agents from the other side of the market. However, real-world markets are often
very large and agents cannot always be expected to even produce a ranking of
all options on the other side. It is therefore important to understand the
impact of incomplete or truncated lists on the quality of the resultant
matching.
  In this paper, we focus on the Serial Dictatorship mechanism in a model where
each agent of the proposing side (students) has a random preference list of
length $d$, sampled independently and uniformly at random from $n$ schools,
each of which has one seat. Our main result shows that if the students
primarily care about being matched to any school of their list (as opposed to
ending up unmatched), then all students in position $i\leq n$ will prefer
markets with longer lists, when $n$ is large enough. Schools on the other hand
will always prefer longer lists in our model. We moreover investigate the
impact of $d$ on the rank of the school that a student gets matched to.
  Our main result suggests that markets that are well-approximated by our
hypothesis and where the demand of schools does not exceed supply should be
designed with preference lists as long as reasonable, since longer lists would
favor all agents.

*Anarya Ray*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于贝叶斯归一化流的方法，用于量化并边缘化模拟紧凑双星合并（CBCs）分布函数的不确定性，以支持引力波观测数据的分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实模拟在密集初始条件网格上成本高昂，且稀疏训练集导致流预测存在不确定性，需要一种方法来量化这些不确定性。

Method: 通过贝叶斯神经网络构建条件密度估计器（贝叶斯归一化流），利用精确似然函数采样流参数的后验分布，以量化和边缘化流不确定性。

Result: 在模拟通过共同包层演化形成的双黑洞群体中，验证了估计不确定性的准确性、校准和数据放大效果。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于基于模拟的引力波观测推断，并有望推广到其他引力波天文学模拟应用中。

Abstract: Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a
crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of
gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations are costly
to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can
emulate the distribution functions of a simulated population of binary
parameters and thereby enable empirical constraints on the astrophysical
initial conditions and branching fractions of various formation channels given
data from a catalog of GW observations. They can also be used for data
amplification in sparse regions of the CBC parameter space to guide the
development of phenomenological population models for rarely synthesizable
systems with components in theorized mass gaps, without having to simulate a
prohibitively large number of binaries. But flow predictions are wrought with
uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work I develop a
method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by
introducing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator
constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function
associated with density estimators I sample the posterior distribution of flow
parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow
uncertainties. I demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, and data-amplification
impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole
populations formed through common envelope evolution. I outline applications of
the methodology in simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and
sketch other uses for general simulation-based approaches in GW astronomy.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality 3D environments is crucial for industries such
as gaming, virtual reality, and cinema, yet remains resource-intensive due to
the reliance on manual processes. This study performs a systematic review of
existing generative AI techniques for 3D scene generation, analyzing their
characteristics, strengths, limitations, and potential for improvement. By
examining state-of-the-art approaches, it presents key challenges such as scene
authenticity and the influence of textual inputs. Special attention is given to
how AI can blend different stylistic domains while maintaining coherence, the
impact of training data on output quality, and the limitations of current
models. In addition, this review surveys existing evaluation metrics for
assessing realism and explores how industry professionals incorporate AI into
their workflows. The findings of this study aim to provide a comprehensive
understanding of the current landscape and serve as a foundation for future
research on AI-driven 3D content generation. Key findings include that advanced
generative architectures enable high-quality 3D content creation at a high
computational cost, effective multi-modal integration techniques like
cross-attention and latent space alignment facilitate text-to-3D tasks, and the
quality and diversity of training data combined with comprehensive evaluation
metrics are critical to achieving scalable, robust 3D scene generation.

Motivation: 现有神经渲染系统在时间外推预测时表现不佳，ODE-GS旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在D-NeRF和NVFI基准测试中，PSNR提升10 dB，LPIPS误差减半。

Conclusion: 连续时间潜在动力学是实现复杂3D场景真实预测的有效方法。

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

Motivation: 随着淡水需求增加，污水处理厂（WWTP）的高效运行至关重要。然而，其复杂性和大量历史数据使得管理者难以全面理解设施运行状态，需要智能方法支持。

Method: 采用可解释人工智能（XAI）和机器学习（ML）技术，分析污水处理厂的历史数据，提取低维数据空间中的操作模式，并解释相关变量和设施单元。

Abstract: Water reuse is a key point when fresh water is a commodity in ever greater
demand, but which is also becoming ever more available. Furthermore, the return
of clean water to its natural environment is also mandatory. Therefore,
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are essential in any policy focused on
these serious challenges.
  WWTPs are complex facilities which need to operate at their best to achieve
their goals. Nowadays, they are largely monitored, generating large databases
of historical data concerning their functioning over time. All this implies a
large amount of embedded information which is not usually easy for plant
managers to assimilate, correlate and understand; in other words, for them to
know the global operation of the plant at any given time. At this point, the
intelligent and Machine Learning (ML) approaches can give support for that
need, managing all the data and translating them into manageable, interpretable
and explainable knowledge about how the WWTP plant is operating at a glance.
  Here, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) based methodology is
proposed and tested for a real WWTP, in order to extract explainable service
knowledge concerning the operation modes of the WWTP managed by AQUAVALL, which
is the public service in charge of the integral water cycle in the City Council
of Valladolid (Castilla y Le\'on, Spain). By applying well-known approaches of
XAI and ML focused on the challenge of WWTP, it has been possible to summarize
a large number of historical databases through a few explained operation modes
of the plant in a low-dimensional data space, showing the variables and
facility units involved in each case.

Motivation: 食双星是研究恒星形成和演化的有力工具，TESS的高分辨率数据为发现和分析这些系统提供了机会。

Method: 使用神经网络筛选约120万颗具有食双星特征的恒星，并通过自动方法和公民科学家的手动检查验证了60000颗目标。

Conclusion: 研究展示了TESS在食双星探测中的强大能力，并提供了未验证目标的候选列表，为未来研究提供了资源。

Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has surveyed nearly the
entire sky in Full-Frame Image mode with a time resolution of 200 seconds to 30
minutes and a temporal baseline of at least 27 days. In addition to the primary
goal of discovering new exoplanets, TESS is exceptionally capable at detecting
variable stars, and in particular short-period eclipsing binaries which are
relatively common, making up a few percent of all stars, and represent powerful
astrophysical laboratories for deep investigations of stellar formation and
evolution. We combed Sectors 1-82 of TESS Full-Frame Image data searching for
eclipsing binary stars using a neural network that identified ~1.2 million
stars with eclipse-like features. Of these, we have performed an in-depth
analysis on ~60,000 targets using automated methods and manual inspection by
citizen scientists. Here we present a catalog of 10001 uniformly-vetted and
-validated eclipsing binary stars that passed all our ephemeris and photocenter
tests, as well as complementary visual inspection. Of these, 7936 are new
eclipsing binaries while the remaining 2065 are known systems for which we
update the published ephemerides. We outline the detection and analysis of the
targets, discuss the properties of the sample, and highlight potentially
interesting systems. Finally, we also provide a list of ~900,000 unvetted and
unvalidated targets for which the neural network found eclipse-like features
with a score higher than 0.9, and for which there are no known eclipsing
binaries within a sky-projected separation of a TESS pixel (~21 arcsec).

Motivation: 现有研究较少探索时序物品序列对推荐系统的影响，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出Heterogeneous Sequel-aware Graph Neural Networks (HSAL-GNNs)，结合时序物品序列和高阶用户嵌入进行推荐。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，HSAL-GNNs优于其他序列学习算法（如Transformer、图神经网络、自编码器）。

Conclusion: 时序物品序列信息的引入显著提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Graph-based recommendation systems use higher-order user and item embeddings
for next-item predictions. Dynamically adding collaborative signals from
neighbors helps to use similar users' preferences during learning. While
item-item correlations and their impact on recommendations have been studied,
the efficacy of temporal item sequences for recommendations is much less
explored. In this paper, we examine temporal item sequence (sequel-aware)
embeddings along with higher-order user embeddings and show that sequel-aware
Graph Neural Networks have better (or comparable) recommendation performance
than graph-based recommendation systems that do not consider sequel
information. Extensive empirical results comparing Heterogeneous Sequel-aware
Graph Neural Networks (HSAL-GNNs) to other algorithms for sequential learning
(such as transformers, graph neural networks, auto-encoders) are presented on
three synthetic and three real-world datasets. Our results indicate that the
incorporation of sequence information from items greatly enhances
recommendations.

TL;DR: ODIS是一种预训练方法，通过对象级自蒸馏改进视觉表示，解决了图像级自蒸馏在多对象场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉预训练方法假设每张图像仅含单一对象，限制了在复杂场景数据集上的扩展性。ODIS旨在通过对象级自蒸馏提升表示能力。

Method: ODIS利用对象感知裁剪和掩码注意力隔离对象区域，将噪声场景任务分解为简单对象级子任务。

Result: ODIS在ViT-Large上实现了82.6%的ImageNet1k k-NN准确率。

Conclusion: ODIS通过对象级自蒸馏显著提升了视觉表示能力，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

Motivation: 现有AV-LLMs和基准测试主要关注静态或2D场景，而动态3D空间推理在人类认知中至关重要，但尚未被充分探索。

Method: 提出SAVVY方法，包括两个阶段：(i) 利用AV-LLMs和其他视听方法追踪关键对象轨迹；(ii) 构建动态全局地图，并通过坐标转换生成最终答案。

Result: SAVVY显著提升了现有AV-LLMs在动态3D空间推理任务中的性能。

Conclusion: SAVVY-Bench和SAVVY方法为动态3D空间推理设定了新标准，推动了AV-LLMs的发展。

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习需要高效且鲁棒的图像表示，尤其是当图像包含任务无关的干扰元素（如阴影、云、光线）时。若这些干扰未在训练中出现，问题更为突出。

Method: SPD方法通过并行使用弱增强和强增强，并通过预测双向增强版本之间的逆向和正向转换来学习表示。

Result: 在MuJoCo视觉控制任务和CARLA自动驾驶任务中，SPD在复杂观察中优于先前研究，并显著提升了对未见过观察的泛化性能。

Conclusion: SPD方法在提取任务相关特征和泛化能力方面表现出色，适用于复杂视觉环境。

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is
available at https://github.com/unigary/SPD.

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

Result: 在Lp指标和平均查询次数上优于现有方法，支持自定义失真类型，并在HMDB-51和UCF-101数据集上评估了4种流行模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了视频分类模型的鲁棒性评估，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote
sensing applications, particularly water body detection. However, deep
learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR
image segmentation.

Conclusion: MORSE-500为多模态推理研究提供了透明、可复现且可持续演进的基准测试资源。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

Result: 实验表明，传统方法在传感器数据延迟时性能显著下降，而新方法在同步和延迟条件下均表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该模型无关的方法有效解决了传感器数据延迟问题，提升了自动驾驶感知系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

TL;DR: SPAT设备通过多光照条件下的32张图像，结合神经网络和算法，显著提高了过敏反应检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高皮肤点刺试验（SPT）的检测一致性和准确性，通过自动化方法减少人为误差。

Method: 使用SPAT设备的32张图像，结合神经网络分割和算法检测，手动标注10,416个过敏反应区域。

Result: 在多光照条件下，SPAT的检测准确性显著高于传统单光照图像。

Conclusion: 多光照条件下的SPAT图像比传统单光照图像更准确，适合临床诊断。

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估指标RSS，结合了预测准确性、校准和不确定性质量，以全面评估半监督语义分割模型的可靠性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前半监督分割评估仅关注准确性，忽视了可靠性和鲁棒性，而这两者对安全关键应用（如自动驾驶）至关重要。

Method: 引入Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS)，通过调和平均值结合准确性、校准和不确定性质量，并评估UniMatchV2模型。

Result: 半监督方法常以可靠性换取准确性；UniMatchV2在域外评估中表现鲁棒，但可靠性仍有不足。

Conclusion: 建议采用更全面的评估指标（如RSS）以更好地满足实际部署需求。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于样本特定分数感知噪声注入（SSNI）的新框架，通过预训练分数网络动态调整噪声水平，显著提升了扩散净化方法的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散净化方法对所有样本使用固定噪声水平，而研究发现不同样本需要不同的噪声水平，尤其是干净样本应注入较少噪声。

Method: SSNI利用预训练分数网络估计样本偏离干净数据分布的程度（分数范数），并通过重加权函数自适应调整每个样本的噪声水平。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K上，结合SSNI的扩散净化方法在准确性和鲁棒性上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在扩散净化方法中为不同样本分配不同噪声水平是必要的，SSNI框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维张量数据在现代深度学习应用中普遍存在，需要高效的低计算成本处理方法。

Method: 利用“角树”数学工具，提出FIS层，支持图像到图像转换，并与其他层无缝集成。

Result: 在分类和异常检测任务中表现优异，参数和计算量大幅减少，性能接近更大模型。

Conclusion: FIS层为高维数据处理提供了高效解决方案，适用于多种任务，代码已开源。

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing
and modelling codes are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有CNN方法忽视浅层与深层特征的异质性，导致特征协作不足，影响检测性能和计算效率。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保持低计算复杂性和高推理效率。

Conclusion: SDS-Net在红外小目标检测中展现出优越性能和广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

Motivation: 细粒度作物分类对精准农业和食品安全监测至关重要，但现有研究因高光谱数据获取和标注成本高而稀缺。

Method: 构建了H2Crop数据集，结合EnMAP高光谱数据和Sentinel-2时间序列，提出双流Transformer架构，分别处理光谱-空间和时间动态特征。

Conclusion: 高光谱数据在多时相窗口和作物变化场景中均表现出一致优势，为细粒度作物分类提供了新基准。

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个新的基准MF$^2$，用于评估模型对长视频内容（如电影）的核心叙事信息的理解和推理能力，发现现有模型表现远不如人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在长视频内容理解上存在局限，现有基准多关注细节或依赖自动生成的问题，未能反映真正的理解能力。

Method: 引入MF$^2$基准，包含50多部电影和850多对人工构建的真实与虚假声明对，要求模型识别每对中的真假声明。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在任务中表现远不及人类，突显其在核心叙事信息理解和推理上的不足。

Conclusion: MF$^2$基准揭示了当前VLMs在长视频内容理解上的局限性，为未来研究提供了更精准的评估工具。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音中的副语言/非语言信息对听众印象至关重要，但现有零样本TTS在控制这些信息方面仍具挑战性。

Method: 使用低维向量表示语音印象对（如暗-亮）的强度，并通过大语言模型生成目标印象向量。

Result: 客观和主观评估均验证了该方法在印象控制上的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无需手动优化的目标印象生成。

Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the
listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved
high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to
control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains
challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in
zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the
intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results
of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's
effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a
large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural
language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for
manual optimization.

Motivation: 尽管CTC假设标签上下文独立，但现代强大的编码器仍能隐式学习上下文依赖的ILM。本文旨在探究CTC中ILM的隐含上下文依赖性。

Method: 提出基于知识蒸馏（KD）的上下文依赖ILM估计方法，并引入两种正则化方法。实验在Librispeech和TED-LIUM Release 2数据集上进行。

Result: 实验结果显示，上下文依赖的ILM在跨域评估中优于上下文无关的先验模型，且提出的标签级KD平滑方法在词错误率上比浅融合提升了13%以上。

Conclusion: CTC确实学习了上下文依赖的ILM，提出的方法在跨域任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Although connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has the label context
independence assumption, it can still implicitly learn a context-dependent
internal language model (ILM) due to modern powerful encoders. In this work, we
investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the ILM of CTC. To this
end, we propose novel context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on
knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications. Furthermore, we
introduce two regularization methods for KD. We conduct experiments on
Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain
evaluation, respectively. Experimental results show that context-dependent ILMs
outperform the context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation,
indicating that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD
with smoothing method surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, with more than
13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.

Motivation: 传统深度神经网络在解决mp-QP问题时无法提供最优且可行的预测，即使在大规模数据集上训练。因此，需要一种更高效且准确的方法。

Method: 提出PSNN架构，直接从优化问题的数学性质中推导模型权重，减少对训练数据的依赖，并应用于能源管理系统（如直流最优潮流）。

Conclusion: PSNN能够快速生成最优且可行的解，适用于大规模仿真和长期规划，展示了其在工程应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Neural Networks (NN) with ReLU activation functions are used to model
multiparametric quadratic optimization problems (mp-QP) in diverse engineering
applications. Researchers have suggested leveraging the piecewise affine
property of deep NN models to solve mp-QP with linear constraints, which also
exhibit piecewise affine behaviour. However, traditional deep NN applications
to mp-QP fall short of providing optimal and feasible predictions, even when
trained on large datasets. This study proposes a partially-supervised NN (PSNN)
architecture that directly represents the mathematical structure of the global
solution function. In contrast to generic NN training approaches, the proposed
PSNN method derives a large proportion of model weights directly from the
mathematical properties of the optimization problem, producing more accurate
solutions despite significantly smaller training data sets. Many energy
management problems are formulated as QP, so we apply the proposed approach to
energy systems (specifically DC optimal power flow) to demonstrate proof of
concept. Model performance in terms of solution accuracy and speed of
predictions was compared against a commercial solver and a generic Deep NN
model based on classical training. Results show KKT sufficient conditions for
PSNN consistently outperform generic NN architectures with classical training
using far less data, including when tested on extreme, out-of-training
distribution test data. Given its speed advantages over traditional solvers,
the PSNN model can quickly produce optimal and feasible solutions within a
second for millions of input parameters sampled from a distribution of
stochastic demands and renewable generator dispatches, which can be used for
simulations and long term planning.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning, despite its popularity and empirical
success, faces significant scalability challenges in large-population dynamic
games. Graphon mean field games (GMFGs) offer a principled framework for
approximating such games while capturing heterogeneity among players. In this
paper, we propose and analyze a policy optimization framework for
continuous-time, finite-horizon linear-quadratic GMFGs. Exploiting the
structural properties of GMFGs, we design an efficient policy parameterization
in which each player's policy is represented as an affine function of their
private state, with a shared slope function and player-specific intercepts. We
develop a bilevel optimization algorithm that alternates between policy
gradient updates for best-response computation under a fixed population
distribution, and distribution updates using the resulting policies. We prove
linear convergence of the policy gradient steps to best-response policies and
establish global convergence of the overall algorithm to the Nash equilibrium.
The analysis relies on novel landscape characterizations over
infinite-dimensional policy spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm under varying graphon
structures, noise levels, and action frequencies.

Conclusion: 该方法相比蒙特卡洛方法具有输出严格上下界的优势，适用于任何系统。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing expectation values of local functions
under the Gibbs distribution of a spin system. In particular, we study two
families of linear programming hierarchies for this problem. The first
hierarchy imposes local spin flip equalities and has been considered in the
bootstrap literature in high energy physics. For this hierarchy, we prove fast
convergence under a spatial mixing (decay of correlations) condition. This
condition is satisfied for example above the critical temperature for Ising
models on a $d$-dimensional grid. The second hierarchy is based on a Markov
chain having the Gibbs state as a fixed point and has been studied in the
optimization literature and more recently in the bootstrap literature. For this
hierarchy, we prove fast convergence provided the Markov chain mixes rapidly.
Both hierarchies lead to an $\varepsilon$-approximation for local expectation
values using a linear program of size quasi-polynomial in $n/\varepsilon$,
where $n$ is the total number of sites, provided the interactions can be
embedded in a $d$-dimensional grid with constant $d$. Compared to standard
Monte Carlo methods, an advantage of this approach is that it always (i.e., for
any system) outputs rigorous upper and lower bounds on the expectation value of
interest, without needing an a priori analysis of the convergence speed.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and certifiability of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs)
requires robust decision-making systems, supported by extensive simulation,
testing, and validation across a broad range of scenarios. However, the current
landscape of maritime autonomy development is fragmented -- relying on
disparate tools for communication, simulation, monitoring, and system
integration -- which hampers interdisciplinary collaboration and inhibits the
creation of compelling assurance cases, demanded by insurers and regulatory
bodies. Furthermore, these disjointed tools often suffer from performance
bottlenecks, vendor lock-in, and limited support for continuous integration
workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce PyGemini, a permissively
licensed, Python-native framework that builds on the legacy of Autoferry Gemini
to unify maritime autonomy development. PyGemini introduces a novel
Configuration-Driven Development (CDD) process that fuses Behavior-Driven
Development (BDD), data-oriented design, and containerization to support
modular, maintainable, and scalable software architectures. The framework
functions as a stand-alone application, cloud-based service, or embedded
library -- ensuring flexibility across research and operational contexts. We
demonstrate its versatility through a suite of maritime tools -- including 3D
content generation for simulation and monitoring, scenario generation for
autonomy validation and training, and generative artificial intelligence
pipelines for augmenting imagery -- thereby offering a scalable, maintainable,
and performance-oriented foundation for future maritime robotics and autonomy
research.

### [207] [Learning to Recover: Dynamic Reward Shaping with Wheel-Leg Coordination for Fallen Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05516)
*Boyuan Deng,Luca Rossini,Jin Wang,Weijie Wang,Nikolaos Tsagarakis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于学习的框架，结合动态奖励调整和课程学习，用于轮腿机器人跌倒后的自适应恢复，显著提升了恢复成功率和能量效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轮腿机器人在实际应用中需要具备跌倒后快速恢复的能力，但传统方法依赖预定义动作或简化动力学，难以生成鲁棒的恢复策略。

Method: 采用基于情节的动态奖励调整和课程学习，结合非对称的actor-critic架构和噪声注入观测，优化恢复策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在两种四足平台上实现了高达99.1%和97.8%的恢复成功率，同时降低了关节扭矩消耗。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态奖励和课程学习，显著提升了轮腿机器人的恢复性能和能量效率，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Adaptive recovery from fall incidents are essential skills for the practical
deployment of wheeled-legged robots, which uniquely combine the agility of legs
with the speed of wheels for rapid recovery. However, traditional methods
relying on preplanned recovery motions, simplified dynamics or sparse rewards
often fail to produce robust recovery policies. This paper presents a
learning-based framework integrating Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping and
curriculum learning, which dynamically balances exploration of diverse recovery
maneuvers with precise posture refinement. An asymmetric actor-critic
architecture accelerates training by leveraging privileged information in
simulation, while noise-injected observations enhance robustness against
uncertainties. We further demonstrate that synergistic wheel-leg coordination
reduces joint torque consumption by 15.8% and 26.2% and improves stabilization
through energy transfer mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on two distinct
quadruped platforms achieve recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8%
without platform-specific tuning. The supplementary material is available at

TL;DR: BEAST是一种新颖的动作标记器，使用B样条将动作序列编码为紧凑的离散或连续标记，无需单独训练标记器，支持并行解码生成平滑轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动作标记器（如向量量化或字节对编码）需要单独训练且标记长度不一致，BEAST旨在解决这些问题，同时生成平滑轨迹。

Method: BEAST利用B样条编码动作序列，支持离散或连续标记，并与三种模型架构（VAE、Transformer、Florence-2）集成验证其兼容性。

Result: 在166个模拟任务和8个真实任务中，BEAST显著降低计算成本，生成平滑控制信号，并达到与先进方法竞争的任务成功率。

Conclusion: BEAST是一种高效、兼容性强且性能优越的动作标记器，适用于连续控制任务。

Abstract: We present the B-spline Encoded Action Sequence Tokenizer (BEAST), a novel
action tokenizer that encodes action sequences into compact discrete or
continuous tokens using B-splines. In contrast to existing action tokenizers
based on vector quantization or byte pair encoding, BEAST requires no separate
tokenizer training and consistently produces tokens of uniform length, enabling
fast action sequence generation via parallel decoding. Leveraging our B-spline
formulation, BEAST inherently ensures generating smooth trajectories without
discontinuities between adjacent segments. We extensively evaluate BEAST by
integrating it with three distinct model architectures: a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) with continuous tokens, a decoder-only Transformer with
discrete tokens, and Florence-2, a pretrained Vision-Language Model with an
encoder-decoder architecture, demonstrating BEAST's compatibility and
scalability with large pretrained models. We evaluate BEAST across three
established benchmarks consisting of 166 simulated tasks and on three distinct
robot settings with a total of 8 real-world tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that BEAST (i) significantly reduces both training and inference
computational costs, and (ii) consistently generates smooth, high-frequency
control signals suitable for continuous control tasks while (iii) reliably
achieves competitive task success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的快速重规划算法，用于解决多机器人协作任务中的动态重规划问题，并在性能和速度上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多机器人系统在复杂环境中执行任务时，需要快速适应动态变化，但现有方法在重规划、协作、任务时长建模和实际部署方面存在不足。

Method: 提出了一种新的协作任务重规划问题变体，并开发了一种基于图注意力网络和注意力模型的编码器/解码器模型。

Result: 在无人机协作任务中，新方法在90%的情况下性能接近最优解，且运行速度比现有方法快85-370倍。

Conclusion: 该研究为自主多机器人系统的鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cooperative autonomous robotic systems have significant potential for
executing complex multi-task missions across space, air, ground, and maritime
domains. But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous
environments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile
or slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning
algorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning
shows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when
formulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1)
are unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location;
2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with
variable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board
deployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a
novel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and
develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and
Attention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple
example of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the
time) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic
solver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi. This work paves
the way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems.

<details>

Result: 实验表明，该方法在功能感知和模仿学习方法中表现优越。

Conclusion: 该方法为几何装配任务提供了一种有效的解决方案，并通过基准验证了其性能。

Abstract: Shape assembly, the process of combining parts into a complete whole, is a
crucial robotic skill with broad real-world applications. Among various
assembly tasks, geometric assembly--where broken parts are reassembled into
their original form (e.g., reconstructing a shattered bowl)--is particularly
challenging. This requires the robot to recognize geometric cues for grasping,
assembly, and subsequent bimanual collaborative manipulation on varied
fragments. In this paper, we exploit the geometric generalization of
point-level affordance, learning affordance aware of bimanual collaboration in
geometric assembly with long-horizon action sequences. To address the
evaluation ambiguity caused by geometry diversity of broken parts, we introduce
a real-world benchmark featuring geometric variety and global reproducibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both
previous affordance-based and imitation-based methods. Project page:

*Jarek Duda*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于移动估计器的非参数方法，用于适应非平稳时间序列，特别适用于金融数据中的α-Stable分布参数估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如ARMA-ARCH）假设固定的依赖类型，可能导致偏差。本文旨在通过更灵活的方法适应非平稳性。

Method: 使用移动估计器，通过指数加权局部对数似然优化，动态更新参数（如绝对中心矩），并应用于α-Stable分布。

Result: 方法成功应用于DJIA时间序列，动态估计了中心、尺度参数和α参数，评估了市场稳定性。

Conclusion: 移动估计器提供了一种灵活且无偏的方法，适用于非平稳时间序列分析，特别是在金融数据中评估极端事件风险。

Abstract: Nonstationarity of real-life time series requires model adaptation. In
classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH there is assumed some arbitrarily chosen
dependence type. To avoid their bias, we will focus on novel more agnostic
approach: moving estimator, which estimates parameters separately for every
time $t$: optimizing $F_t=\sum_{\tau<t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta
(x_\tau))$ local log-likelihood with exponentially weakening weights of the old
values. In practice such moving estimates can be found by EMA (exponential
moving average) of some parameters, like $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ absolute central
moments, updated by $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. We
will focus here on its applications for alpha-Stable distribution, which also
influences Hurst exponent, hence can be used for its adaptive estimation. Its
application will be shown on financial data as DJIA time series - beside
standard estimation of evolution of center $\mu$ and scale parameter $\sigma$,
there is also estimated evolution of $\alpha$ parameter allowing to
continuously evaluate market stability - tails having $\rho(x) \sim
1/|x|^{\alpha+1}$ behavior, controlling probability of potentially dangerous
extreme events.

TL;DR: EDHR是DHR算法的扩展，用于0-1背包问题，能生成最多$n^i$个子实例，显著减少搜索树规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展DHR算法以更灵活地处理0-1背包问题，适应不同需求。

Method: 将0-1 KP实例缩减为最多$n^i$个子实例，$i$可调。

Result: 实验表明EDHR比CPLEX显著减少搜索树规模。

Conclusion: EDHR是DHR的有效扩展，适用于0-1 KP的灵活处理。

Abstract: Dembo-Hammer's Reduction Algorithm (DHR) is one of the classical algorithms
for the 0-1 Knapsack Problem (0-1 KP) and its variants, which reduces an
instance of the 0-1 KP to a sub-instance of smaller size with reduction time
complexity $O(n)$. We present an extension of DHR (abbreviated as EDHR), which
reduces an instance of 0-1 KP to at most $n^i$ sub-instances for any positive
integer $i$. In practice, $i$ can be set as needed. In particular, if we choose
$i=1$ then EDHR is exactly DHR. Finally, computational experiments on randomly
generated data instances demonstrate that EDHR substantially reduces the search
tree size compared to CPLEX.

Abstract: This work establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for analyzing deep

Motivation: 研究如何通过观察少量像素预测图像未观察部分，以提高图像重建效率和质量。

Method: 提出了一种改进的ConvNADE模型，适用于实值和彩色图像，并比较了随机和低差异像素块的重建效果。

Result: 实验表明，使用低差异序列像素块能降低测试损失并生成更真实的图像。

Conclusion: 低差异像素块选择策略能显著提升图像重建质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data
by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of
one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on
preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in
which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels
(referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As
our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally
efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution
estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover,
we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random
pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo
theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels
akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more
realistic reconstructed images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏自动化或半自动化的纵向肿瘤分割解决方案，而这对放疗、手术干预和化疗反应评估至关重要。

Method: LinGuinE通过刚性配准将初始肿瘤标记点传播到其他时间点，并使用点击有效性分类器选择有效点以生成新分割。

Result: 在两项测试数据集上，LinGuinE的Dice分数提高了20%以上（p<0.05）。

Conclusion: LinGuinE是一种高效且灵活的纵向肿瘤分割方法，适用于任意起始时间点。

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in
radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in
assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

Conclusion: DART-Vetter是一种高效、开源且易于复制的工具，适用于自动化筛选或辅助人工审核。

Abstract: In the identification of new planetary candidates in transit surveys, the
employment of Deep Learning models proved to be essential to efficiently
analyse a continuously growing volume of photometric observations. To further
improve the robustness of these models, it is necessary to exploit the
complementarity of data collected from different transit surveys such as NASA's
Kepler, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and, in the near future,
the ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission. In this
work, we present a Deep Learning model, named DART-Vetter, able to distinguish
planetary candidates (PC) from false positives signals (NPC) detected by any
potential transiting survey. DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network that
processes only the light curves folded on the period of the relative signal,
featuring a simpler and more compact architecture with respect to other
triaging and/or vetting models available in the literature. We trained and
tested DART-Vetter on several dataset of publicly available and homogeneously
labelled TESS and Kepler light curves in order to prove the effectiveness of
our model. Despite its simplicity, DART-Vetter achieves highly competitive
triaging performance, with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and
Kepler data, when compared to Exominer and Astronet-Triage. Its compact, open
source and easy to replicate architecture makes DART-Vetter a particularly
useful tool for automatizing triaging procedures or assisting human vetters,
showing a discrete generalization on TCEs with Multiple Event Statistic (MES) >
20 and orbital period < 50 days.

Motivation: 在差分隐私下解释聚类结果具有挑战性，现有框架可能泄露敏感信息，因此需要一种既能保护隐私又能提供有效解释的方法。

Method: DPClustX框架输入敏感数据集和私有聚类标签，输出满足DP的全局解释，突出每个聚类的主要特征。

Result: 实验表明，DPClustX在严格隐私约束下仍能提供准确且有洞察力的解释。

Conclusion: DPClustX成功解决了差分隐私下聚类解释的难题，平衡了隐私保护与数据分析的需求。

Abstract: The dire need to protect sensitive data has led to various flavors of privacy
definitions. Among these, Differential privacy (DP) is considered one of the
most rigorous and secure notions of privacy, enabling data analysis while
preserving the privacy of data contributors. One of the fundamental tasks of
data analysis is clustering , which is meant to unravel hidden patterns within
complex datasets. However, interpreting clustering results poses significant
challenges, and often necessitates an extensive analytical process.
Interpreting clustering results under DP is even more challenging, as analysts
are provided with noisy responses to queries, and longer, manual exploration
sessions require additional noise to meet privacy constraints. While increasing
attention has been given to clustering explanation frameworks that aim at
assisting analysts by automatically uncovering the characteristics of each
cluster, such frameworks may also disclose sensitive information within the
dataset, leading to a breach in privacy. To address these challenges, we
present DPClustX, a framework that provides explanations for black-box
clustering results while satisfying DP. DPClustX takes as input the sensitive
dataset alongside privately computed clustering labels, and outputs a global
explanation, emphasizing prominent characteristics of each cluster while
guaranteeing DP. We perform an extensive experimental analysis of DPClustX on
real data, showing that it provides insightful and accurate explanations even
under tight privacy constraints.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习（FL）中隐私保护和计算效率的挑战，特别是在大型语言模型（LLM）的微调过程中。

Method: 使用剪枝和全同态加密（FHE）处理低秩适应（LoRA）参数，结合优化的联邦算法提升效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持隐私保护的同时，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedShield-LLM为资源受限的组织提供了一种安全高效的LLM协作训练方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework for training and
fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging computational resources
across organizations while keeping sensitive data on local devices. It
addresses privacy and security concerns while navigating challenges associated
with the substantial computational demands of LLMs, which can be prohibitive
for small and medium-sized organizations. FL supports the development of
task-specific LLMs for cross-silo applications through fine-tuning but remains
vulnerable to inference attacks, such as membership inference and gradient
inversion, which threaten data privacy. Prior studies have utilized
Differential Privacy (DP) in LLM fine-tuning, which, despite being effective at
preserving privacy, can degrade model performance. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a novel method, FedShield-LLM, that uses pruning with
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) parameters,
enabling secure computations on encrypted model updates while mitigating the
attack surface by deactivating less important LoRA parameters. Furthermore,
optimized federated algorithms for cross-silo environments enhance scalability
and efficiency. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA
substantially reduce computational and communication overhead, making FL
feasible for resource-constrained clients. Experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing methods while maintaining robust privacy
protection, enabling organizations to collaboratively train secure and
efficient LLMs.

Conclusion: ORCAS在抵抗混淆和跨架构分析中表现优异，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) serves as a core technique for binary
analysis tasks such as vulnerability detection. While current graph-based BCSA
approaches capture substantial semantics and show strong performance, their
performance suffers under code obfuscation due to the unstable control flow. To
address this issue, we develop ORCAS, an Obfuscation-Resilient BCSA model based
on Dominance Enhanced Semantic Graph (DESG). The DESG is an original binary
code representation, capturing more binaries' implicit semantics without
control flow structure, including inter-instruction relations, inter-basic
block relations, and instruction-basic block relations. ORCAS robustly scores
semantic similarity across binary functions from different obfuscation options,
optimization levels, and instruction set architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BinKit dataset shows ORCAS significantly outperforms eight baselines,
achieving an average 12.1% PR-AUC gain when using combined three obfuscation
options compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, ORCAS
improves recall by up to 43% on an original obfuscated real-world vulnerability
dataset, which we released to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Foundation models represent the most prominent and recent paradigm shift in
artificial intelligence.Foundation models are large models, trained on broad
data that deliver high accuracy in many downstream tasks, often without
fine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers
(ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications.
However, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces
significant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. Such attacks involve deliberately crafted inputs designed to deceive
AI systems, jeopardizing their reliability.This paper studies the
vulnerabilities of vision foundation models, focusing specifically on CLIP and
ViTs, and explores the transferability of adversarial attacks to downstream
tasks. We introduce a novel attack, targeting the structure of
transformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic fashion.We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our attack on several downstream tasks: classification,
captioning, image/text retrieval, segmentation and depth estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算中预训练模型易受对抗攻击，现有联邦对抗训练（FAT）方法泛化性强但个性化不足且通信成本高。

Method: Sylva采用两阶段方法：1）本地LoRA微调减少通信；2）基于博弈论的层选择策略优化准确性。

Result: 实验显示Sylva通信效率提升50倍，对抗鲁棒性和良性准确性分别提升29.5%和50.4%。

Conclusion: Sylva为边缘计算提供高效、个性化的对抗防御解决方案。

Abstract: The growing adoption of large pre-trained models in edge computing has made
deploying model inference on mobile clients both practical and popular. These
devices are inherently vulnerable to direct adversarial attacks, which pose a
substantial threat to the robustness and security of deployed models. Federated
adversarial training (FAT) has emerged as an effective solution to enhance
model robustness while preserving client privacy. However, FAT frequently
produces a generalized global model, which struggles to address the diverse and
heterogeneous data distributions across clients, resulting in insufficiently
personalized performance, while also encountering substantial communication
challenges during the training process. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sylva}, a personalized collaborative adversarial training framework
designed to deliver customized defense models for each client through a
two-phase process. In Phase 1, \textit{Sylva} employs LoRA for local
adversarial fine-tuning, enabling clients to personalize model robustness while
drastically reducing communication costs by uploading only LoRA parameters
during federated aggregation. In Phase 2, a game-based layer selection strategy
is introduced to enhance accuracy on benign data, further refining the
personalized model. This approach ensures that each client receives a tailored
defense model that balances robustness and accuracy effectively. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textit{Sylva} can achieve
up to 50$\times$ improvements in communication efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, while achieving up to 29.5\% and 50.4\%
enhancements in adversarial robustness and benign accuracy, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法不适用于分布式数据存储和隐私保护需求，需要一种联邦且差分隐私的聚类方法。

Method: 结合服务器端数据（可能小且分布外）进行初始化，并使用简单的联邦DP-Lloyds算法实现聚类。

Result: 在合成和真实基准任务中表现优异，并提供了收敛速度和聚类识别成功的理论界限。

Conclusion: ACRONYM算法有效解决了分布式和隐私保护场景下的聚类问题，具有理论和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of data analysis that is particularly suited to
identifying coherent subgroups or substructures in unlabeled data, as are
generated continuously in large amounts these days. However, in many cases
traditional clustering methods are not applicable, because data are
increasingly being produced and stored in a distributed way, e.g. on edge
devices, and privacy concerns prevent it from being transferred to a central
server. To address this challenge, we present \acronym, a new algorithm for
$k$-means clustering that is fully-federated as well as differentially private.
Our approach leverages (potentially small and out-of-distribution) server-side
data to overcome the primary challenge of differentially private clustering
methods: the need for a good initialization. Combining our initialization with
a simple federated DP-Lloyds algorithm we obtain an algorithm that achieves
excellent results on synthetic and real-world benchmark tasks. We also provide
a theoretical analysis of our method that provides bounds on the convergence
speed and cluster identification success.

### [226] [FERRET: Private Deep Learning Faster And Better Than DPSGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05416)
*David Zagardo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FERRET是一种基于1位梯度压缩和互信息差分隐私（MI-DP）的高效训练方法，通过Bernoulli掩码传输符号位，实现隐私保护、高效性和性能的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过1位梯度压缩和互信息差分隐私（MI-DP）解决隐私保护训练中的效率与性能问题。

Method: 提出FERRET方法，使用Bernoulli掩码传输符号位，并通过理论证明其隐私损失上限。

Result: FERRET在隐私保护、训练效率和模型性能上优于DPSGD，接近非隐私训练的表现。

Conclusion: FERRET通过符号位压缩和MI-DP，实现了隐私、效率和性能的三重优化，为隐私保护训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: We revisit 1-bit gradient compression through the lens of mutual-information
differential privacy (MI-DP). Building on signSGD, we propose FERRET--Fast and
Effective Restricted Release for Ethical Training--which transmits at most one
sign bit per parameter group with Bernoulli masking.
  Theory: We prove each fired group leaks at most ln 2 nats; after subsampling
with rate s, the total privacy loss of G groups trained for T steps with firing
probability p is epsilon = G * T * s * p * ln 2. Thus FERRET achieves MI-DP for
epsilon in [0.1, 2] without additive noise.
  Practice: We evaluate three granularities--FERRET-MAX (finest), FERRET-EIGHTH
(medium), and FERRET-2 (coarsest)--on five LLMs (137M-1.8B parameters) against
DPSGD and Non-DP baselines. All methods trained for 1, 3, and 5 epochs.
  Utility: Across all settings, FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH beat DPSGD's perplexity. At
epsilon=0.5, 5 epochs: FERRET-EIGHTH achieves 3.98 perplexity vs DPSGD's 11.61
(2.9x better), within 23% of Non-DP (3.25).
  Privacy: MI-AUC stays at chance for FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH (~0.51), matching DPSGD
vs Non-DP's 0.76-0.99. FERRET-2 shows higher leakage (~0.55) due to lower
headroom.
  Efficiency: Stricter budgets fire fewer signs, so FERRET uses 19-33% of
DPSGD's training time and only 34-36% of Non-DP training time.
  Take-away: Sign-based MI-DP gets closer to achieving all three qualities of
the privacy, utility, performance trilemma: FERRET trains up to 5x faster,
achieves 3x lower perplexity compared to DPSGD and 1.2x greater than Non-DP,
all while providing formal, mathematically provable privacy guarantees using
zero additive noise. The results also show that, in certain instances, masked
1-bit updates can match non-private training utility while safeguarding data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需预定义提示的模型窃取方法Stealix，通过遗传算法优化提示，显著提升了合成图像的精度和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型窃取对机器学习安全构成威胁，现有方法依赖人工设计提示，限制了自动化和可扩展性。

Method: Stealix利用两个预训练模型推断受害者模型的数据分布，并通过遗传算法迭代优化提示。

Result: 实验表明，Stealix在相同查询预算下显著优于其他方法，包括使用类别名或精细提示的方法。

Conclusion: 预训练生成模型在模型窃取中的风险可能比之前认为的更大，Stealix展示了其可扩展性。

Abstract: Model stealing poses a significant security risk in machine learning by
enabling attackers to replicate a black-box model without access to its
training data, thus jeopardizing intellectual property and exposing sensitive
information. Recent methods that use pre-trained diffusion models for data
synthesis improve efficiency and performance but rely heavily on manually
crafted prompts, limiting automation and scalability, especially for attackers
with little expertise. To assess the risks posed by open-source pre-trained
models, we propose a more realistic threat model that eliminates the need for
prompt design skills or knowledge of class names. In this context, we introduce
Stealix, the first approach to perform model stealing without predefined
prompts. Stealix uses two open-source pre-trained models to infer the victim
model's data distribution, and iteratively refines prompts through a genetic
algorithm, progressively improving the precision and diversity of synthetic
images. Our experimental results demonstrate that Stealix significantly
outperforms other methods, even those with access to class names or
fine-grained prompts, while operating under the same query budget. These
findings highlight the scalability of our approach and suggest that the risks
posed by pre-trained generative models in model stealing may be greater than
previously recognized.

*Shibo Li,Yao Zheng*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: MPS是一种用于非平稳时间序列在线模型选择的新框架，结合了共形推断和模型置信集，动态选择最优模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型选择方法依赖平稳性假设，但在非平稳环境中表现不佳。现实数据多为非平稳，因此需要一种适应动态变化的模型选择方法。

Method: 结合共形推断和模型置信集，实时更新候选模型的置信集，确保覆盖下一时间段的最优模型。

Result: MPS在非平稳环境下可靠且高效地识别最优模型，并能生成高质量的小规模集合。

Conclusion: MPS是一种通用框架，适用于各种数据生成过程、模型类别和评估指标，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces the MPS (Model Prediction Set), a novel framework for
online model selection for nonstationary time series. Classical model selection
methods, such as information criteria and cross-validation, rely heavily on the
stationarity assumption and often fail in dynamic environments which undergo
gradual or abrupt changes over time. Yet real-world data are rarely stationary,
and model selection under nonstationarity remains a largely open problem. To
tackle this challenge, we combine conformal inference with model confidence
sets to develop a procedure that adaptively selects models best suited to the
evolving dynamics at any given time. Concretely, the MPS updates in real time a
confidence set of candidate models that covers the best model for the next time
period with a specified long-run probability, while adapting to nonstationarity
of unknown forms. Through simulations and real-world data analysis, we
demonstrate that MPS reliably and efficiently identifies optimal models under
nonstationarity, an essential capability lacking in offline methods. Moreover,
MPS frequently produces high-quality sets with small cardinality, whose
evolution offers deeper insights into changing dynamics. As a generic
framework, MPS accommodates any data-generating process, data structure, model
class, training method, and evaluation metric, making it broadly applicable
across diverse problem settings.

Result: 实验证明该方法计算高效，对模型误设具有鲁棒性，且性能优于现有非线性DAG学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在非线性ANM下能有效恢复真实因果DAG，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Recent advances have established the identifiability of a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) under additive noise models (ANMs), spurring the development of
various causal discovery methods. However, most existing methods make
restrictive model assumptions, rely heavily on general independence tests, or
require substantial computational time. To address these limitations, we
propose a sequential procedure to orient undirected edges in a completed
partial DAG (CPDAG), representing an equivalence class of DAGs, by leveraging
the pairwise additive noise model (PANM) to identify their causal directions.
We prove that this procedure can recover the true causal DAG assuming a
restricted ANM. Building on this result, we develop a novel constraint-based
algorithm for learning causal DAGs under nonlinear ANMs. Given an estimated
CPDAG, we develop a ranking procedure that sorts undirected edges by their
adherence to the PANM, which defines an evaluation order of the edges. To
determine the edge direction, we devise a statistical test that compares the
log-likelihood values, evaluated with respect to the competing directions, of a
sub-graph comprising just the candidate nodes and their identified parents in
the partial DAG. We further establish the structural learning consistency of
our algorithm in the large-sample limit. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is computationally efficient,
robust to model misspecification, and consistently outperforms many existing
nonlinear DAG learning methods.

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，该方法在固定计算预算下显著提高了SBI的准确性。

Conclusion: 新方法为计算资源受限的神经SBI提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for
Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator.
These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing
down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a
simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators
are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that
can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI
which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several
simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through
both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can
significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational
budget.
