In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a\ndistributed alternative without the need to share data. Recently, for the\ngrowing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes,\npersonalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to\nleverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual\nuser preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential,\nmost PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the\ndata and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios. In contrast,\nwe first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark for\nmulti-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution\nshifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all\nclients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we\npropose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides\ncustomized global models to each client.

Even for LLM-enable test case generation, due to a lack of\ndomain knowledge, they are also incapable of generating test cases that invoke\nall interface and internal logic of connectors. In this paper, we propose\nreinforcement learning (RL)-guided LLM test-case generation for database\nconnector testing. Specifically, to equip the LLM with sufficient and\nappropriate domain knowledge, a parameterized prompt template is composed which\ncan be utilized to generate numerous prompts. Test cases are generated via LLM\nwith a prompt, and are dynamically evaluated through differential testing\nacross multiple connectors. The testing is iteratively conducted, with each\nround RL is adopted to select optimal prompt based on prior-round behavioral\nfeedback, so as to maximize control flow coverage. We implement aforementioned\nmethodology in a practical tool and evaluate it on two widely used JDBC\nconnectors: MySQL Connector/J and OceanBase Connector/J.

Such communication relies on time-triggered flows, with each flow\nconsisting of periodic packets originating from a source and destined for a\ndestination node. Each packet needs to reach its destination before its\ndeadline. Different flows can have different cycle lengths. To achieve assured\ntransmission of time-triggered flows, existing efforts constrain the packets of\na flow to be cyclically transmitted along the same path. Under such Fixed\nCyclic Scheduling (FCS), reservation for flows with different cycle lengths can\nbecome incompatible over a shared link, limiting the total number of admissible\nflows. Considering the cycle lengths of different flows, a hyper-cycle has\nlength equal to their least common multiple (LCM). It determines the time\nduration over which the scheduling compatibility of the different flows can be\nchecked. In this work, we propose a more flexible schedule scheme called the\nHypercycle-level Flexible Schedule (HFS) scheme, where a flow's resource\nreservation can change across cycles within a hypercycle. HFS can significantly\nincrease the number of admitted flows by providing more scheduling options\nwhile remaining perfectly compatible with existing Time-Triggered Ethernet\nsystem. We show that, theoretically the possible capacity gain provided by HFS\nover FCS can be unbounded. We formulate the joint pathfinding and scheduling\nproblem under HFS as an ILP problem which we prove to be NP-Hard. To solve HFS\nefficiently, we further propose a least-load-first heuristic (HFS-LLF), solving\nHFS as a sequence of shortest path problems. Extensive study shows that HFS\nadmits up to 6 times the number of flows achieved by FCS.

Supervised detection relies on large,\ncurated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this\nwork, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for\nzero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit\nsome task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we\nshow that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and\nsignificantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing\nthe model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the\nsynthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1\nscores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are\nconsistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,\nand animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating\nstrong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional\nmodel sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --\nsuggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a\nbehavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers\nfrom diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.\nEven here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --\nindicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that\ntask-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent\ncapabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a\nsimple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods.

In contrast,\nTversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a\nrepresentation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a\nfunction of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been\nused in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating\ndiscrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of\nTversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive\nneural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which\nunlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.\nThrough experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that\nthe Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear\nprojection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image\nclassification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer\nachieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter\nbaseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases\nby 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified\ninterpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input\nstimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization\ntechnique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers.

Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient alternative to full\nfine-tuning, especially leveraging reparameterized weights $\\Delta W$ to adapt\nmodels for downstream tasks. However, a critical yet underexplored question\nremains: can we utilize well-pretrained weights $W_0$ to guide the update of\ntask-specific $\\Delta W$, avoiding inefficient training it from scratch? To end\nthis, we propose Generative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (GenFT), a novel\nmethod that extracts structured, transferable information from $W_0$ for\nefficient $\\Delta W$ training. To extract row and column structure information,\nGenFT applies row and column transformations to distill essential patterns from\n$W_0$. A tailored policy further decomposes $\\Delta W$ into layer-shared and\nlayer-specific components, balancing information reuse and individualized\nflexibility. GenFT is simple yet effective, achieving superior performance\nacross CV and NLP tasks.

Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic\nspectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However,\ntraditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically\ndeveloped to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and\namplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal\nsegmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these\nlimitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of\nexisting RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on\ncomplex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet\nintroduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex\nplane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training\nperformance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and\nreal-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of\n98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued\ncounterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet\nachieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,\ncompared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up\nto a 92.2% over the state of the art.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework\ncoined PFP (Preference Feature Preservation). The key idea of PFP is\nmaintaining the distribution of human preference features and utilizing such\nrich signals throughout the online preference learning process.

Then, using trained classifier and the\ndistribution preserving optimization, PFP maps appropriate preference features\nfor a new input instruction during online learning. Lastly, PFP trains LLM\nusing the existing preference learning method, by incorporating the preference\nfeature into system prompts and enabling LLM to explicitly handle various human\npreferences.

While most\nstudies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper\nhighlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic\ndecision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness\nrequirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general\nframework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average\nexpected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could\nobtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three\ncomponents that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the\nspurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain. We analyze the\nintrinsic connection between these components and an emerging fairness notion\ncalled benefit fairness that aims to control the equity of outcomes in\ndecision-making.

Similarly, inclusion\nof covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their\nperformance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.\nWhile TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream\nclassification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in\nforecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs\nforecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle\nin more complex building environments compared to statistical models.

This practical challenge\nsignificantly limits model performance and application. To address this issue,\nwe propose Coda, a Code graph-based tuning adaptor designed to enhance existing\nPKT models by identifying and mitigating the impact of noise. Specifically,\nCoda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a\ncompact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be\nidentified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a\ncluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak\nsignals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight\nyet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization\nwith two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization\nterm, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning\nthat the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing\nPKT solutions.

Existing\nnode label noise models like Symmetric Label Noise (SLN) and Class Conditional\nNoise (CCN) disregard this important node relationship in graph data; and the\nEdge-Dependent Noise (EDN) model addresses this limitation. EDN posits that in\nreal-world scenarios, label noise may be influenced by the connections between\nnodes. We explore three variants of EDN. A crucial notion that relates nodes\nand edges in a graph is the degree of a node; we show that in all three\nvariants, the probability of a node's label corruption is dependent on its\ndegree. Additionally, we compare the dependence of these probabilities on node\ndegree across different variants. We performed experiments on popular graph\ndatasets using 5 different GNN architectures and 8 noise robust algorithms for\ngraph data.

Because efficiency has been the main metric of\nprogress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible\ncatastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to\nsearch for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small\namount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream\ntask classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token\nfor decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from\nincorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to\ncontrol a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In\nSSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected\nby the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be\ncontrolled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models\nfrom three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and\nfour diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias\nin Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a\nsingle token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,\nfor light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA\nrank.

For\nexample, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG\nsystem might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,\ncausing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even\nwhen the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this\npaper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which\nsystematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases\nthrough a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation\nmethod based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection\ntechniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback\nmechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream\nlarge language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance\nmodel biases in dimensions.

Such desirability\nassessments are crucial to derive actions, but process analysts typically\nconduct them in a manual, ad-hoc way, which can be time-consuming, subjective,\nand irreplicable. To address this problem, this paper presents a procedural\nframework to guide process analysts in systematically assessing deviation\ndesirability. It provides a step-by-step approach for identifying which input\nfactors to consider in what order to categorize deviations into mutually\nexclusive desirability categories, each linked to action recommendations. The\nframework is based on a review and conceptualization of existing literature on\ndeviation desirability, which is complemented by empirical insights from\ninterviews with process analysis practitioners and researchers. We evaluate the\nframework through a desirability assessment task conducted with practitioners,\nindicating that the framework effectively enables them to streamline the\nassessment for a thorough yet concise evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u5408\u610f\u6027\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u7c7b\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u63a8\u8350\u884c\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5224\u65ad\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5408\u610f\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u624b\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8017\u65f6\u3001\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u6b65\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u8003\u8651\u8f93\u5165\u56e0\u7d20\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7b80\u5316\u5408\u610f\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u504f\u5dee\u5408\u610f\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002"}}

In this short\npaper, we bring further evidence on this controversial point. To do so, we\ncompare 62 students and 42 software professionals on a bug-fixing task on the\nsame Java program. The students were enrolled in a Bachelor's program in\nComputer Science, while the professionals were employed by two multinational\ncompanies (for one of them, the professionals were from two offices). Some\nvariations in the experimental settings of the two groups (students and\nprofessionals) were present. For instance, the experimental environment of the\nexperiment with professionals was more realistic; i.e., they faced some stress\nfactors such as interruptions during the bug-fixing task. Considering the\ndifferences between the two groups of participants, the gathered data show that\nthe students outperformed the professionals in fixing bugs.

This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering\nmethods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering\nproposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and\npropose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference\nframeworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation\ntechniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential\nMonte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian\nCram\\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities.

Although numerous defense\nmethods have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities, many rely on\nheuristic metrics, overfit to specific attack patterns, and suffer from high\ncomputational complexity. In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based\nEdge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework.\nKCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the\ngraph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error\nbound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the\nchange in GKC when the edge is removed.

Conventional noise mitigation methods often rely on explicit\nassumptions about noise distributions or require extensive retraining, which\ncan be impractical for large-scale models. Inspired by the principles of\nmachine unlearning, we propose a novel framework that integrates\nattribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and\ntargeted fine-tuning to mitigate the impact of noisy samples. Our approach\nemploys gradient-based attribution to probabilistically distinguish\nhigh-quality examples from potentially corrupted ones without imposing\nrestrictive assumptions on the noise. It then applies regression-based\nsensitivity analysis to identify and prune neurons that are most vulnerable to\nnoise. Finally, the resulting network is fine-tuned on the high-quality data\nsubset to efficiently recover and enhance its generalization performance. This\nintegrated unlearning-inspired framework provides several advantages over\nconventional noise-robust learning approaches. Notably, it combines data-level\nunlearning with model-level adaptation, thereby avoiding the need for full\nmodel retraining or explicit noise modeling. We evaluate our method on\nrepresentative tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10 image classification and speech\nrecognition) under various noise levels and observe substantial gains in both\naccuracy and efficiency.

An over\nreliance on physical knowledge can be detrimental, particularly when the\nphysics-based component of a model may not accurately represent the true\nunderlying system. An underutilisation of physical knowledge potentially wastes\na valuable resource, along with benefits in model interpretability and reduced\ndemand for expensive data collection. Achieving an optimal physics-data balance\nis a challenging aspect of model design, particularly if the level varies\nthrough time; for example, one might have a physical approximation, only valid\nwithin particular regimes, or a physical phenomenon may be known to only occur\nwhen given conditions are met (e.g. at high temperatures). This paper develops\nnovel, physically-informed, change-point kernels for Gaussian processes,\ncapable of dynamically varying the reliance upon available physical knowledge.\nA high level of control is granted to a user, allowing for the definition of\nconditions in which they believe a phenomena should occur and the rate at which\nthe knowledge should be phased in and out of a model.

It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix,\nwhich, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph\nto the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured\nby the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening\nframeworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting\nmatrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a\ncoarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of\nthese two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on\nthe lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the\ncoarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this\npaper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not\nnecessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy\nof ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different\nproperties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form\ndescription or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed\nlifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the\nreduction matrix.

Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects\nemerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally\nlocalized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or\ntemporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that\nperturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory\nassessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations\nbetween evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should\ninterpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align\nwith whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features.

However, their structure\nconstrains their applicability to sequences only or requires processing\nmulti-dimensional data structures, such as images or molecular graphs, in a\npre-defined sequential order. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are\nwell suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and\ndirected acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of\nmulti-dimensionality to linear RNNs. We introduce parallelizable Linear Source\nTransition Mark networks (pLSTMs) using Source, Transition, and Mark gates that\nact on the line graph of a general DAG. This enables parallelization in analogy\nto parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential\nlinear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this\nscheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations,\nand padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding\nactivation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes:\na directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode\n(D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce\narrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains\nlong-distance directional information. We demonstrate that pLSTMs generalize\nwell to larger image sizes, whereas Transformers struggle to extrapolate.

Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of\nout of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA\nin simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates\nunder distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios.

We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based\nMemory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables\nmodel fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC\nconstructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware\nsingular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.\nFine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle\nthe misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we\npropose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,\nwhich thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports\nflexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it\nadaptable to a wide range of applications.

Using a public space study with 40 participants\nperforming a long-horizon robot task, we recreated the setup in simulation and\nannotated all demonstrations. We identify four types of sidetracks\n(Exploration, Mistake, Alignment, Pause) and one control pattern (one-dimension\ncontrol).

We tested three\ndifferent models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras\nDiffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a\nTransformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as\nwell as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence\nIndex and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic\nasymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The\nSGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing\nPET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in\nwhole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass\ncorrelation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the\ninputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for\nquantitative performance and visual quality. In summary, SGMs hold great\npotential for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all 3 model types can\nsynthesize full-dose FDG-PET accurately using MRI and ultralow-dose PET.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u975e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728MRI\u5230PET\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08SGM-KD\uff09\u5728\u7eafMRI\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u52a0\u5165\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfPET\u540e\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u766b\u75eb\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11FDG PET\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u5242\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u901a\u8fc7MRI\u6216\u6781\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfPET\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfPET\u56fe\u50cf\u7684AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752852\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u540c\u6b65PET/MRI\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08SGM-KD\u548cSGM-VP\uff09\u548cTransformer-Unet\u5728MRI\u5230PET\u8f6c\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "SGM-KD\u5728\u7eafMRI\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u52a0\u51651%\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfPET\u540e\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e14\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u8fd1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7eafMRI\u5230PET\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7MRI\u548c\u6781\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfPET\u51c6\u786e\u5408\u6210\u5168\u5242\u91cfFDG-PET\u56fe\u50cf\u3002"}}

To further\nenhance performance, SecONNds employs Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)\npreprocessing and leverages GPU acceleration for homomorphic encryption\noperations, resulting in speedups of 1.6$\\times$ on CPU and 2.2$\\times$ on GPU\nfor linear operations.

In this work, we aim to take a step\nforward in this direction by presenting a comprehensive analysis of what we\nrefer to as symmetric autoencoders, a broad class of deep learning\narchitectures ubiquitous in the literature. Specifically, we introduce a formal\ndistinction between different classes of symmetric architectures, analyzing\ntheir strengths and limitations from a mathematical perspective.

These branches are\nconnected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers\nanatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,\nenabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained\nsemantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning\nfetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized\nvideo anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in\nzero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation\ntransfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "DISCOVR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u810f\u8d85\u58f0\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u805a\u7c7b\u84b8\u998f\u635f\u5931\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u9886\u57df\u56e0\u7ec6\u5fae\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684SSL\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u805a\u7c7b\u84b8\u998f\u635f\u5931\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u89c6\u9891SSL\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "DISCOVR\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d85\u58f0\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making\nself-organisation central to understanding natural complexity.

In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method\nspecifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space,\nleveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations\nthat capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations\nonto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal\nparameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics.\nWe evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and\nan agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers\nparameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes.

Probabilistic Graphical\nModels (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage\ngraph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The\nquestion is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in\nnetworked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task\nand we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one\nfocuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two\ninvestigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of\nthe graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot\nexploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters.

However, the long-term dynamics\nof aboveground carbon (AGC) in forests and their sink-source transitions remain\nhighly uncertain, owing to changing disturbance regimes and inconsistencies in\nobservations, data processing, and analysis methods. Here, we derive reliable,\nharmonized AGC stocks and fluxes in global forests from 1988 to 2021 at high\nspatial resolution by integrating multi-source satellite observations with\nprobabilistic deep learning models.

Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders\n(VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some\ninput data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study.\nYet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations\nrelies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability\ndistribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence\naccount for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have\nbeen previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its\nprobabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical\ndescriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to\nlearn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of\nfaithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this\ntask. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard\nmethods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain\nmeaningful and interpretable.
