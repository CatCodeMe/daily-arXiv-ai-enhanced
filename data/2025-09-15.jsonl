We are interested in some commonly used spatial queries, such as range\nemptiness, range count, and nearest neighbor queries. These queries have\nessential applications in data analytics, such as filtering relational data\nbased on attribute ranges and temporal graph analysis for counting graph\nstructures like stars, paths, and cliques. Furthermore, this line of research\ncan accelerate relational algorithms that incorporate spatial queries in their\nworkflow, such as relational clustering. Known approaches either have to spend\n$\\tilde{O}(N)$ query time or use space as large as the number of query results,\nwhich are inefficient or unrealistic to employ in practice. Hence, we aim to\nconstruct an index that answers spatial conjunctive queries in both time- and\nspace-efficient ways.\n  In this paper, we establish lower bounds on the tradeoff between answering\ntime and space usage. For $k$-star (resp. $k$-path) queries, we show that any\nindex for range emptiness, range counting or nearest neighbor queries with $T$\nanswering time requires $\\Omega\\left(N+\\frac{N^k}{T^k}\\right)$ (resp.\n$\\Omega\\left(N+\\frac{N^2}{T^{2/(k-1)}}\\right)$) space. Then, we construct\noptimal indexes for answering range emptiness and range counting problems over\n$k$-star and $k$-path queries. Extending this result, we build an index for\nhierarchical queries. By resorting to the generalized hypertree decomposition,\nwe can extend our index to arbitrary conjunctive queries for supporting spatial\nconjunctive queries. Finally, we show how our new indexes can be used to\nimprove the running time of known algorithms in the relational setting."}

Our first contribution is an interesting\nobservation that the SOTA solution, AGP-Static, can be adapted to support\ndynamic parameterized queries; however several challenges remain unresolved.\nFirstly, the query time complexity of AGP-Static is based on an assumption of\nusing an optimal algorithm for subset sampling in its query algorithm.\nUnfortunately, back to that time, such an algorithm did not exist; without such\nan optimal algorithm, an extra $O(\\log^2 n)$ factor is required in the query\ncomplexity, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graphs. Secondly,\nAGP-Static performs poorly on dynamic graphs, taking $O(n\\log n)$ time to\nprocess each update. To address these challenges, we propose a new algorithm,\nAGP-Static++, which is simpler yet reduces roughly a factor of $O(\\log^2 n)$ in\nthe query complexity while preserving the approximation guarantees of\nAGP-Static. However, AGP-Static++ still requires $O(n)$ time to process each\nupdate. To better support dynamic graphs, we further propose AGP-Dynamic, which\nachieves $O(1)$ amortized time per update, significantly improving the\naforementioned $O(n)$ per-update bound, while still preserving the query\ncomplexity and approximation guarantees. Last, our comprehensive experiments\nvalidate the theoretical improvements: compared to the baselines, our algorithm\nachieves speedups of up to $177\\times$ on update time and $10\\times$ on query\nefficiency."}

This is a universal problem that also exists beyond\nsoftware engineering tasks: any AI system should be more than correct - it must\nalso be cost-effective. To address this gap, we introduce SWE-Effi, a set of\nnew metrics to re-evaluate AI systems in terms of holistic effectiveness\nscores. We define effectiveness as the balance between the accuracy of outcome\n(e.g., issue resolve rate) and the resources consumed (e.g., token and time).\nIn this paper, we specifically focus on the software engineering scenario by\nre-ranking popular AI systems for issue resolution on a subset of the SWE-bench\nbenchmark using our new multi-dimensional metrics.

Research was conducted on a known broomrape-infested\ntomato farm in Woodland, Yolo County, CA, across five key growth stages\ndetermined by growing degree days (GDD). Multispectral images were processed to\nisolate tomato canopy reflectance. At 897 GDD, broomrape could be detected with\n79.09 percent overall accuracy and 70.36 percent recall without integrating\nlater stages.

Fetal EEG is complex to acquire and difficult and\nlaborious to interpret consistently. However, accurate sleep stage\nclassification may aid in the early detection of abnormal brain maturation\nassociated with pregnancy complications (e.g. hypoxia or intrauterine growth\nrestriction).\n  Methods: EEG electrodes were secured onto the ovine dura over the parietal\ncortices of 24 late gestation fetal sheep. A lightweight deep neural network\noriginally developed for adult EEG sleep staging was trained on the ovine EEG\nusing transfer learning from adult EEG. A spectral equalisation-based domain\nadaptation strategy was used to reduce cross-domain mismatch.\n  Results: We demonstrated that while direct transfer performed poorly, full\nfine tuning combined with spectral equalisation achieved the best overall\nperformance (accuracy: 86.6 percent, macro F1-score: 62.5), outperforming\nbaseline models.\n  Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, FetalSleepNet is the first deep\nlearning framework specifically developed for automated sleep staging from the\nfetal EEG.

There has been recent numerical benchmarks of quadratures for\nthe sliced Wasserstein, and our viewpoint differs in that we concentrate on\nquadratures where the nodes are repulsive, i.e. negatively dependent. Indeed,\nnegative dependence can bring variance reduction when the quadrature is adapted\nto the integration task. Our first contribution is to extract and motivate\nquadratures from the recent literature on determinantal point processes (DPPs)\nand repelled point processes, as well as repulsive quadratures from the\nliterature specific to the sliced Wasserstein distance.

DP-CDA\nsynthesizes data in a centralized setting by mixing multiple randomly-selected\nsamples from the same class and injecting carefully calibrated Gaussian noise,\nensuring ({\\epsilon}, {\\delta})-differential privacy. When deployed in a\ndecentralized or federated setting, where each client holds only a small\npartition of the data, DP-CDA faces new challenges. The limited sample size per\nclient increases the sensitivity of local computations, requiring higher noise\ninjection to maintain the differential privacy guarantee. This, in turn, leads\nto a noticeable degradation in the utility compared to the centralized setting.\nTo mitigate this issue, we integrate the Correlation-Assisted Private\nEstimation (CAPE) protocol into the federated DP-CDA framework and propose CAPE\nAssisted Federated DP-CDA algorithm. CAPE enables limited collaboration among\nthe clients by allowing them to generate jointly distributed (anti-correlated)\nnoise that cancels out in aggregate, while preserving privacy at the individual\nlevel. This technique significantly improves the privacy-utility trade-off in\nthe federated setting. Extensive experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed CAPE Assisted Federated DP-CDA approach can\nachieve utility comparable to its centralized counterpart under some parameter\nregime, while maintaining rigorous differential privacy guarantees."}

This has led to\nclaims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a\nfew shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply\nlearning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the\nmodels rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue\nthat, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full\ncharacterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale\nanalysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,\ndistributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an\neffective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise\nto unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more\nnumerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt\nstyle, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from\nregularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity,\nespecially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied\naccuracies on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc\nencoding is not a robust mechanism, and suggests limited all-purpose\ngeneralisability."}

We present an\ninformation-theoretic framework that reveals both the fundamental dynamics of\nRL and provides practical methods for diagnosing deployment-time anomalies.\nThrough analysis of state-action mutual information patterns in a robotic\ncontrol task, we first demonstrate that successful learning exhibits\ncharacteristic information signatures: mutual information between states and\nactions steadily increases from 0.84 to 2.83 bits (238% growth) despite growing\nstate entropy, indicating that agents develop increasingly selective attention\nto task-relevant patterns. Intriguingly, states, actions and next states joint\nmutual information, MI(S,A;S'), follows an inverted U-curve, peaking during\nearly learning before declining as the agent specializes suggesting a\ntransition from broad exploration to efficient exploitation. More immediately\nactionable, we show that information metrics can differentially diagnose system\nfailures: observation-space, i.e., states noise (sensor faults) produces broad\ncollapses across all information channels with pronounced drops in state-action\ncoupling, while action-space noise (actuator faults) selectively disrupts\naction-outcome predictability while preserving state-action relationships. This\ndifferential diagnostic capability demonstrated through controlled perturbation\nexperiments enables precise fault localization without architectural\nmodifications or performance degradation. By establishing information patterns\nas both signatures of learning and diagnostic for system health, we provide the\nfoundation for adaptive RL systems capable of autonomous fault detection and\npolicy adjustment based on information-theoretic principles."}

WhisTLE\ntrains a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model encoder outputs from text and\nfine-tunes the decoder using the learned text-to-latent encoder, optionally\ncombined with text-to-speech (TTS) adaptation.
