Specifically, we reduce the data\nstructure problem to the Unambiguous Arthur-Merlin (UAM) communication\ncomplexity of $f(x,y)$ under product distributions.\n  We apply our framework to the Partial Match problem (a.k.a, matching with\nwildcards), whose underlying communication problem is sparse set-disjointness.\nWhen the database consists of $n$ points in dimension $d$, and the number of\n$\\star$'s in the query is at most $w = c\\log n \\;(\\ll d)$, the fastest known\nlinear-space data structure (Cole, Gottlieb and Lewenstein, STOC'04) had query\ntime $t \\approx 2^w = n^c$, which is nontrivial only when $c<1$.

The increasing\nhardware diversity in HPC systems often necessitates the development of\narchitecture-specific code, hindering the sustainability of large-scale\nscientific applications. In this work, we leverage DaCe, a data-centric\nparallel programming framework, to automate the generation of high-performance\nkernels. DaCe enables automatic code generation for multicore processors and\nvarious accelerators, reducing the burden on developers who would otherwise\nneed to rewrite code for each new architecture. Our study demonstrates DaCe's\ncapabilities by applying its automatic code generation to a critical\ncomputational kernel used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Specifically,\nwe focus on Neko, a Fortran-based solver that employs the spectral-element\nmethod, which relies on small tensor operations. We detail the formulation of\nthis computational kernel using DaCe's Stateful Dataflow Multigraph (SDFG)\nrepresentation and discuss how this approach facilitates high-performance code\ngeneration.

Finally, we utilize a hypergraph network\nto capture the multilateral association knowledge for augmenting vulnerability\ndetection. We evaluate IFMA-VD on three widely used vulnerability datasets and\ndemonstrate improvements in F-measure and Recall compared to baseline methods.\nAdditionally, we illustrate that multilateral association features can boost\ncode feature representation and validate the effectiveness of IFMA-VD on\nreal-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "IFMA-VD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4ee3\u7801\u884c\u4e3a\u8d85\u56fe\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u8fb9\u5377\u79ef\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u8fb9\u5173\u8054\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u51fd\u6570\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u591a\u8fb9\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5168\u9762\u3002", "method": "1. \u89e3\u6790\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2. \u6784\u5efa\u4ee3\u7801\u884c\u4e3a\u8d85\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u56fe\u7f51\u7edc\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u8fb9\u5173\u8054\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aF-measure\u548cRecall\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u591a\u8fb9\u5173\u8054\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7801\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "IFMA-VD\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u8fb9\u5173\u8054\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

In many real-world instances,\non the other hand, the minimum number of cliques in an edge cover or partition\ncan be very close to the size of a maximum independent set \\alpha(G).\n  Motivated by this observation, we investigate above \\alpha parameterizations\nof the edge clique cover and partition problems. Concretely, we introduce and\nstudy Edge Clique Cover Above Independent Set (ECC/\\alpha) and Edge Clique\nPartition Above Independent Set (ECP/\\alpha), where the goal is to cover or\npartition all edges of a graph using at most \\alpha(G) + k cliques, and k is\nthe parameter.

We show that ECP/\\alpha is fixed-parameter tractable, whereas\nECC/\\alpha is NP-complete for all k \\geq 2, yet can be solved in polynomial\ntime for k \\in {0,1}. These findings highlight intriguing differences between\nthe two problems when viewed through the lens of parameterization above a\nnatural lower bound.\n  Finally, we demonstrate that ECC/\\alpha becomes fixed-parameter tractable\nwhen parameterized by k + \\omega(G), where \\omega(G) is the size of a maximum\nclique of the graph G.

This paper seeks\nto understand when it is worth adopting micro frontends, particularly in the\ncontext of industry.

We then implemented this architectural style in a marketplace for\nhandcrafted products, which already used microservices. Finally, we evaluated\nthe implementation through a semi-open questionnaire with the developers. At\nthe studied marketplace company, the need for architectural change arose due to\nthe tight coupling between their main system (a Java monolith) and a dedicated\nfrontend system. Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor\ndeveloper experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture\nwas adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and\ntechnologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro\nFrontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's\nneeds. According to the analysis of the mixed questionnaire responses, other\nalternatives, such as a monolithic frontend, could have achieved comparable\nresults.

While classical closure\nmodeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale\nphenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in\nregimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of\ndiffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure\nmodeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical\napplications for many real-world applications.

In the dispersive variant of the\nArt Gallery Problem, the objective is not to minimize the number of guards but\nto maximize the minimum geodesic $L_1$-distance between any two guards, called\nthe dispersion distance.\n  Our main contributions are as follows. We prove that determining whether a\nvertex guard set can achieve a dispersion distance of $4$ in office-like\npolygons is NP-complete, where vertices of the polygon are restricted to\ninteger coordinates. Additionally, we present a simple worst-case optimal\nalgorithm that guarantees a dispersion distance of $3$ in polynomial time. Our\ncomplexity result extends to polyominoes, resolving an open question posed by\nRieck and Scheffer (CGTA 2024).

While FPGAs offer a promising\nplatform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target\nfeed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom\nimplementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the\nopen-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment\nof LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open\nNeural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of\nLSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and\nfunctional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom\ntransformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation\ngraph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and\nVitis HLS.

Existing LoRA-based\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and\nfreezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and\nambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design\nintroduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts\nper input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful\ncomponents across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or\ncontradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks\nand insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features\nacross tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As\nmore experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating\nforgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with\nself-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple\nlow-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,\neach treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1\nexpert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid\nambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own\nrelevance via intermediate activations.

Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift\n(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the\ninput distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution\nP(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily\nfocus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these\nmethods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading\nto catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different\nsources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift\ncalls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from\nretaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a\ngeneral adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To\naddress this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework\ndesigned to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable\nhistorical knowledge.

Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g.,\nmixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another.\nHowever, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of\nTransformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate\ninformation into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel\narchitecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle\noutward.

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream\nbackbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it\ndifficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel\nrelationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address\nthis issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration\nof local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise\nmodeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch\nconvolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a\ntemporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial\nConformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal\ndynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention\nmodule further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven\nimportance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI)\ndatasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings\ndemonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline\nmodels, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG\nConformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the\nfeatures extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned\nwith sensorimotor priors in MI.

To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational\nautoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial\ninputs from authentic OOD samples.

This study\nintroduces a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)\napproach for automated heuristic discovery, optimising low-storage ESRK\nmethods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on manually designed\nheuristics or exhaustive numerical searches, our method leverages GA-driven\nmutations for search-space exploration and an RL-inspired state transition\nmechanism to refine heuristic selection dynamically. This enables systematic\nparameter reduction, preserving fourth-order accuracy while significantly\nimproving computational efficiency.The proposed GA-RL heuristic optimisation\nframework is validated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems,\nincluding the 1D and 2D Brusselator systems and the steady-state Navier-Stokes\nequations.

To address this\nchallenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that\nintegrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process\nmining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected\nfrom low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These\nanomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the\ndiscovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By\nincorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach\nsupports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root\ncause analysis and behavioral understanding.

While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or\nhighly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of\ngrokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language\nmodel (LLM), i.e., OLMoE.

We further demystify grokking's \"emergence of\ngeneralization\" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find\nthat training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve\nfrom random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples\nduring grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the\nconverged loss.

In the study, we\ndevelop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a\nsingle pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement\non diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely\ndependent on training data.

Existing work either\nrequires interpolation or focuses only on univariate inputs. This paper\npresents new and somewhat surprising theoretical results for multivariate\ninputs. On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and\n(2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable\nminima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness\ndoes imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily\ndeteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows. This gives an\nexponential separation between the flat solutions vis-\\`a-vis low-norm\nsolutions (i.e., weight decay), which knowingly do not suffer from the curse of\ndimensionality.

We introduce ZKPROV, a novel\ncryptographic framework that enables zero-knowledge proofs of LLM provenance.\nIt allows users to verify that a model is trained on a reliable dataset without\nrevealing sensitive information about it or its parameters. Unlike prior\napproaches that focus on complete verification of the training process\n(incurring significant computational cost) or depend on trusted execution\nenvironments, ZKPROV offers a distinct balance. Our method cryptographically\nbinds a trained model to its authorized training dataset(s) through\nzero-knowledge proofs while avoiding proof of every training step.

While versatile LLMs appear to\nhave demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and\nproviding responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether\nthey perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence\nindicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing\nshallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal\nknowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine\nhuman-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,\nmethodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of\ntransformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.\nEmpirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,\nwhose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs\nexhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier\nbenchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal\nreasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw\ninspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by\ngeneral knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that\nincorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal\nreasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly\nenhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and\ncounterfactual contexts.

We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as\nRoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy\ncomparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in\ngroundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.\nThe code is available at : https://github.com/chandarlab/Hallucinate-less", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u67e5\u8be2\u662f\u5426\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6587\u6863\u6765\u51cf\u5c11LLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4f46\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6027\uff08groundedness\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982RoBERTa\u548cNomicBERT\uff09\u5728\u7cbe\u9009\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u67e5\u8be2\u662f\u5426\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0eLlama3 8B\u548cGPT4o\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u51cf\u5c11LLMs\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter\nconfigurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres:\nHindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.\n  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in\ncapturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short\nmelodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range\ndependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze\ncomputational resource requirements across different adapter scales,\ndemonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal\nbalance between expressivity and quality.

This\nwork proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration\nfor TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to\nestimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The\nintersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal\nconfiguration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into\nSimulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The\ninitial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the\ncycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,\nfour intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing\nconfiguration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of\ntotal vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic\nflow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that\nswitches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak\ntraffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic\ngenerator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and\na signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,\ndynamic, and hybrid methods.

Object detectors and\nsegmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the\nmodel's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification.

Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to\nquantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not\nmake a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is\ntruly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as\nautomated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this\nwork, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics.\nBounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used\nto describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as\nbounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of\nbounding boxes and classes.

Traditional\nmethods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,\nbut struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across\nmodalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple\nembeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more\ndiverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,\nthese set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse\nsupervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize\none-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity\nwithin the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the\nrepresentations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among\nembeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.\nOur method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k\nwithout relying on external data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u96c6\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u96c6\u5408\u574d\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MS-COCO\u548cFlickr30k\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u5411\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u7a00\u758f\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u96c6\u5408\u574d\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMaximal Pair Assignment Similarity\u4f18\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u96c6\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Global Discriminative Loss\u548cIntra-Set Divergence Loss\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728MS-COCO\u548cFlickr30k\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u96c6\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}
