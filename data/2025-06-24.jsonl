Context is derived by aggregating and\ninferring from dynamic IoT data, making it highly volatile and posing\nchallenges in maintaining freshness and real-time accessibility. Caching is a\npotential solution, but traditional policies struggle with the transient nature\nof context in IoT (e.g., ensuring real-time access for frequent queries or\nhandling fast-changing data). To address this, we propose the Dynamic Context\nMonitoring Framework (DCMF) to enhance context caching in Context Management\nPlatforms (CMPs) by dynamically evaluating and managing context. DCMF comprises\ntwo core components: the Context Evaluation Engine (CEE) and the Context\nManagement Module (CMM). The CEE calculates the Probability of Access (PoA)\nusing parameters such as Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Context (QoC),\nCost of Context (CoC), timeliness, and Service Level Agreements (SLAs),\nassigning weights to assess access likelihood. Based on this, the CMM applies a\nhybrid Dempster-Shafer approach to manage Context Freshness (CF), updating\nbelief levels and confidence scores to determine whether to cache, evict, or\nrefresh context items. We implemented DCMF in a Context-as-a-Service (CoaaS)\nplatform and evaluated it using real-world smart city data, particularly\ntraffic and roadwork scenarios. Results show DCMF achieves a 12.5% higher cache\nhit rate and reduces cache expiry by up to 60% compared to the m-CAC technique,\nensuring timely delivery of relevant context and reduced latency. These results\ndemonstrate DCMF's scalability and suitability for dynamic context-aware IoT\nenvironments."}

A critical challenge is ensuring that distributed memories remain\nsynchronized, relevant, and free from the accumulation of outdated or\ninconsequential data - a process analogous to biological forgetting. This paper\nintroduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework\ndesigned to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in\nMAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic\nvoting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the\nrelevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational\ncontext; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing\nimportance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different\ntime horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based\nconsensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items\nare agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in\nthe presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N\ngreater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient\ninter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage\nand similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations\nin a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's\nefficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%\nvoting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a\n92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an\n82% cache hit rate for memory access."}

Specifically, we prove that\nevery continuous-time infinite-horizon instance can be reduced to a\ncorresponding discrete-time $O( \\frac{ n^3 }{ \\epsilon^6 } )$-period instance,\nwhile incurring a multiplicative optimality loss of at most $1 + \\epsilon$.\n  -- Motivated by this relation, we substantially improve on the $O(\n2^{2^{O(1/\\epsilon)}} \\cdot (nT)^{ O(1) } )$-time approximation scheme of\nNonner and Sviridenko (2013) for the discrete-time joint replenishment problem.\nBeyond an exponential improvement in running time, we demonstrate that\nrandomization and hierarchical decompositions can be entirely avoided, while\nconcurrently offering a relatively simple analysis."}

CodeBERT, a pre-trained language model for\nboth natural and programming languages, was fine-tuned to classify user dropout\ngiven their posts (questions and answers) and code snippets. We found Bagging\nensemble models combined with standardisation achieved the highest R2 value\n(0.821) in predicting user answers. The Stochastic Gradient Descent regressor,\nfollowed by Bagging and Epsilon Support Vector Machine models, consistently\ndemonstrated superior performance to other benchmarked algorithms in predicting\nuser code quality across multiple quality dimensions and languages. Extreme\nGradient Boosting paired with log-transformation exhibited the highest F1-score\n(0.825) in predicting user dropout. CodeBERT was able to classify user dropout\nwith a final F1-score of 0.809, validating the performance of Extreme Gradient\nBoosting that was solely based on numerical data. Overall, our benchmarking of\n21 algorithms provides multiple insights. Researchers can leverage findings\nregarding the most suitable models for specific target variables, and\npractitioners can utilise the identified optimal hyperparameters to reduce the\ninitial search space during their own hyperparameter tuning processes."}

Specifically, in the\nnear-realizable setting we prove an upper bound of\n$\\widetilde{O}\\Bigl(\\theta_{\\max}(d+k)\\ln\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\Bigr)$ and\n$\\widetilde{O}\\Bigl(\\theta_{\\max}(d+k)\\Bigl(\\ln\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}+\\frac{\\nu^2}{\\varepsilon^2}\\Bigr)+\\frac{k\\nu}{\\varepsilon^2}\\Bigr)$\nin the realizable and agnostic settings respectively, where $\\theta_{\\max}$ is\nthe maximum disagreement coefficient among the $k$ distributions, $d$ is the VC\ndimension of the hypothesis class, $\\nu$ is the multi-distribution error of the\nbest hypothesis, and $\\varepsilon$ is the target excess error. Moreover, we\nshow that the bound in the realizable setting is information-theoretically\noptimal and that the $k\\nu/\\varepsilon^2$ term in the agnostic setting is\nfundamental for proper learners. We also establish instance-dependent sample\ncomplexity bound for passive multidistribution learning that smoothly\ninterpolates between realizable and agnostic\nregimes~\\citep{blum2017collaborative,zhang2024optimal}, which may be of\nindependent interest."}

SING enables fast and reliable inference in latent SDE models by\napproximating intractable integrals and parallelizing computations in time. We\nprovide theoretical guarantees that SING will approximately optimize the\nintractable, continuous-time objective of interest. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat better state inference enables more accurate estimation of nonlinear drift\nfunctions using, for example, Gaussian process SDE models. SING outperforms\nprior methods in state inference and drift estimation on a variety of datasets,\nincluding a challenging application to modeling neural dynamics in freely\nbehaving animals. Altogether, our results illustrate the potential of SING as a\ntool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems, especially those\ncharacterized by limited prior knowledge and non-conjugate structure."}

However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred\nfeatures are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty\nof quantifying whether two tasks are \"related\". To address these challenges, we\nevaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component\ntasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of\ntask-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep\nlearning models -- an \"information saturation bottleneck\" -- where networks\nfail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during\ntraining. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during\npretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and\nperform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training\nmixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this\nphenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data\ndistribution or ordering affect the features that current representation\nlearning methods can learn over time.

Our\nmethod systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and\ntransferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the\nperformance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this\nframework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to\ncreate Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE\n(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of\nthe original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned\non a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them\nhighly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and\nremain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves\nsimilar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated\nparameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having\nsignificantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning\ncombined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating\nhigh-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE\narchitectures.

Unifying these paradigms promises richer personalization but remains\nchallenging due to the lack of large-scale conversational datasets grounded in\nreal user behavior. We present ConvRecStudio, a framework that uses large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to simulate realistic, multi-turn dialogs grounded in\ntimestamped user-item interactions and reviews. ConvRecStudio follows a\nthree-stage pipeline: (1) Temporal Profiling, which constructs user profiles\nand community-level item sentiment trajectories over fine-grained aspects; (2)\nSemantic Dialog Planning, which generates a structured plan using a DAG of\nflexible super-nodes; and (3) Multi-Turn Simulation, which instantiates the\nplan using paired LLM agents for the user and system, constrained by\nexecutional and behavioral fidelity checks. We apply ConvRecStudio to three\ndomains -- MobileRec, Yelp, and Amazon Electronics -- producing over 12K\nmulti-turn dialogs per dataset.

Leveraging this convergence, we implement a neural machine\ntranslation model as a cognitive model of human memory search that is both\ninterpretable and capable of capturing complex dynamics of learning. We show\nthat our model accounts for both averaged and optimal human behavioral patterns\nas effectively as context-based memory models. Further, we demonstrate\nadditional strengths of the proposed model by evaluating how memory search\nperformance emerges from the interaction of different model components."}

However, existing\nconversational stance detection datasets are restricted to a limited set of\nspecific targets, which constrains the effectiveness of stance detection models\nwhen encountering a large number of unseen targets in real-world applications.\nTo bridge this gap, we manually curate a large-scale, high-quality zero-shot\nconversational stance detection dataset, named ZS-CSD, comprising 280 targets\nacross two distinct target types. Leveraging the ZS-CSD dataset, we propose\nSITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive\nlearning model, and establish the benchmark performance in the zero-shot\nsetting.

For the distributed setting, we design a\ntwo-phase selection protocol: first, the aggregator selects the top clients\nbased on our utility-driven ranking; then, a verifiable random function (VRF)\nensures a BSA-resistant final selection.

To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models.

Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs.

We demonstrate in several\nexperiments that the knowledge score can anticipate when predictions from a GPR\nmodel are accurate, and that this anticipation improves performance in tasks\nsuch as anomaly detection, extrapolation, and missing data imputation.

Understanding SGD's generalization\nproperties is crucial for ensuring robust model performance on unseen data. In\nthis paper, we analyze the generalization error bounds of SGD for non-convex\nlearning by introducing the Type II perturbed SGD (T2pm-SGD), which\naccommodates both sub-Gaussian and bounded loss functions. The generalization\nerror bound is decomposed into two components: the trajectory term and the\nflatness term. Our analysis improves the trajectory term to $O(n^{-1})$,\nsignificantly enhancing the previous $O((nb)^{-1/2})$ bound for bounded losses,\nwhere n is the number of training samples and b is the batch size. By selecting\nan optimal variance for the perturbation noise, the overall bound is further\nrefined to $O(n^{-2/3})$. For sub-Gaussian loss functions, a tighter trajectory\nterm is also achieved. In both cases, the flatness term remains stable across\niterations and is smaller than those reported in previous literature, which\nincrease with iterations. This stability, ensured by T2pm-SGD, leads to tighter\ngeneralization error bounds for both loss function types.

To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought.
