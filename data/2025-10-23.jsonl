Fields such as healthcare, biomedical\nresearch, and cybersecurity frequently encounter high data acquisition costs,\nlimited access to annotated data, and the rarity or sensitivity of key events.\nThese issues-collectively referred to as the dataset challenge-hinder the\ndevelopment of accurate and generalizable machine learning models in such\nhigh-stakes domains. To address this, we introduce FlexiDataGen, an adaptive\nlarge language model (LLM) framework designed for dynamic semantic dataset\ngeneration in sensitive domains. FlexiDataGen autonomously synthesizes rich,\nsemantically coherent, and linguistically diverse datasets tailored to\nspecialized fields. The framework integrates four core components: (1)\nsyntactic-semantic analysis, (2) retrieval-augmented generation, (3) dynamic\nelement injection, and (4) iterative paraphrasing with semantic validation.\nTogether, these components ensure the generation of high-quality,\ndomain-relevant data. Experimental results show that FlexiDataGen effectively\nalleviates data shortages and annotation bottlenecks, enabling scalable and\naccurate machine learning model development."}

Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as\nthey do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially\nhigh costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have\nreceived extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed\nrepresentations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by\nautoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing\nreduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we\ndecompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,\nthereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.\nIn addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the\nreconstruction errors for identifying anomalies.

Although the\nresource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) lies at the core of\nproject management activities, it remains largely disconnected from the broader\nliterature on model-based systems engineering (MBSE), thereby limiting its\nintegration into the design and management of complex systems. The original\ncontribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper seeks to reconcile the\nRCPSP with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems\nengineering and hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT). A concrete translation\npipeline from an activity-on-node network to a SysML activity diagram, and then\nto an operand net is constructed. Using this representation, it specializes the\nhetero-functional network minimum-cost flow (HFNMCF) formulation to the RCPSP\ncontext as a systematic means of HFGT for quantitative analysis and proves that\nthe RCPSP is recoverable as a special case of a broader model. Secondly, on an\nillustrative instance with renewable and non-renewable operands, the\nspecialized HFNMCF, while producing similar schedules, yields explicit\nexplanations of the project states that enable richer monitoring and control.\nOverall, the framework preserves the strengths of the classical RCPSP while\naccommodating real-world constraints and enterprise-level decision processes\nencountered in large, complex megaprojects."}

In this work, we study the\nlocality of matching problems in the family of regular graphs, which is one of\nthe main benchmarks for establishing lower bounds on the locality of\nsymmetry-breaking problems, as well as for obtaining classification results.\nFor approximate matching, we develop randomized algorithms to show that $(1 +\n\\epsilon)$-approximate matching in regular graphs is truly local; i.e., the\nlocality depends only on $\\epsilon$ and is independent of all other graph\nparameters. Furthermore, as long as the degree $\\Delta$ is not very small\n(namely, as long as $\\Delta \\geq \\text{poly}(1/\\epsilon)$), this dependence is\nonly logarithmic in $1/\\epsilon$.

We compare the performance of different\ntransformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch\ncounterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers\nwhich includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the\nmodel checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging\nthe advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers\nenables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging\nFace, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when\nporting models between frameworks.\n  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon\nmacbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU.

Our key insight is that\nrollout's stateless and embarrassingly parallel nature aligns perfectly with\npreemptible and often fragmented resources. To efficiently utilize these\nresources despite frequent and unpredictable availability changes, RLBoost\nadopts a hybrid architecture with three key techniques: (1) adaptive rollout\noffload to dynamically adjust workloads on the reserved (on-demand) cluster,\n(2) pull-based weight transfer that quickly provisions newly available\ninstances, and (3) token-level response collection and migration for efficient\npreemption handling and continuous load balancing.

The suffix array\n$SA_T[1..n]$ of a text $T$ of length $n$ encodes the lexicographic order of its\nsuffixes and underlies numerous applications in pattern matching, data\ncompression, and bioinformatics. Previous work established one-way reductions\nshowing how suffix array queries can be answered using, for example, rank\nqueries on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform. More recently, a new class of prefix\nqueries was introduced, together with reductions that, among others, transform\na simple tradeoff for prefix-select queries into a suffix array tradeoff\nmatching state-of-the-art space and query-time bounds, while achieving\nsublinear construction time. For binary texts, the resulting data structure\nachieves space $O(n)$ bits, preprocessing time $O(n / \\sqrt{\\log n})$,\npreprocessing space of $O(n)$ bits, and query time $O(\\log^{\\epsilon} n)$ for\nany constant $\\epsilon > 0$. However, whether these bounds could be improved\nusing different techniques has remained open.\n  We resolve this question by presenting the first bidirectional reduction\nshowing that suffix array queries are, up to an additive $O(\\log\\log n)$ term\nin query time, equivalent to prefix-select queries in all parameters. This\nresult unifies prior approaches and shows that essentially all efficient suffix\narray representations can be expressed via prefix-select structures. Moreover,\nwe prove analogous equivalences for inverse suffix array queries, pattern\nranking, lexicographic range, and SA-interval queries, identifying six core\nproblem pairs that connect string and prefix query models. Our framework thus\nprovides a unified foundation for analyzing and improving the efficiency of\nfundamental string-processing problems through the lens of prefix queries."}

For example, minor hyperparameter\nchanges, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants\ncan reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization\nmeasures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For\ninstance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,\nand is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.\nHowever, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across\nlearning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based\nmarginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in\ndata-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is\nnot a post-mortem measure.

We\nshow that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies\nmaximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural\nactivities prior to the decision layer.

We present a taxonomy categorizing these platforms by their\ninterface (conversational, visual, etc.), supported LLM backends, output type\n(chatbot, full application, workflow), and degree of extensibility. Core\nfeatures such as autonomous agents, memory management, workflow orchestration,\nand API integrations are in scope of the survey. We provide a detailed\ncomparison, highlighting each platform's strengths and limitations. Trade offs\n(customizability, scalability, vendor lock-in) are discussed in comparison with\ntraditional and low code development approaches. Finally, we outline future\ndirections, including multimodal interfaces, on device LLMs, and improved\norchestration for democratizing app creation with AI. Our findings indicate\nthat while zero code LLM platforms greatly reduce the barrier to creating AI\npowered applications, they still face challenges in flexibility and\nreliability. Overall, the landscape is rapidly evolving, offering exciting\nopportunities to empower non programmers to create sophisticated software."}

And does the answer depend on what\nwe measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation\nframework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary\ndimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive\nUncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training\nexperiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,\nand Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -\nthe relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on\nmodel capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples\nat different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task\ndemands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final\nrepresentations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate\ninternal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the\nnotion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across\nmodel and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing\ndecision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes."}

The analysis was\nperformed by executing several operations, including downloading data from CSV\nfiles, transforming and loading it into an Apache Iceberg analytical table. It\nwas found that the performance of the Spark algorithm varies significantly\ndepending on the amount of data and the programming language used. When\nprocessing a 5-megabyte CSV file, the best result was achieved in Python: 6.71\nseconds, which is superior to Scala's score of 9.13 seconds and Java's time of\n9.62 seconds. For processing a large CSV file of 1.6 gigabytes, all programming\nlanguages demonstrated similar results: the fastest performance was showed in\nPython: 46.34 seconds, while Scala and Java showed results of 47.72 and 50.56\nseconds, respectively.

When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one\noften assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but\nperhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.\nThe task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this\n`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on\nwhat `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely\nsome discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently\nmonotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a\ncarefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of\nmonotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time\nand the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate\nfeatures which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed\nsystem is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two\nreal-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to\ncombine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high\nmonotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health\nmonitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute\nSpearman's $\\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with\nan absolute Spearman's $\\rho$ of $0.95$.

We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty\nquantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science\nobservations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian\ndeep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in\ndata-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and\nconservation efforts."}

We formulate this question as an\nindependence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model\nor text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it\nthrough the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are\nmore likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob\nis using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between\nBob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training\nrun.

However, the rapidly growing scale outpaces model training on a single\nDC, driving a shift toward a more flexible, cross-DC training paradigm. Under\nthis, Expert Parallelism (EP) of MoE faces significant scalability issues due\nto the limited cross-DC bandwidth. Specifically, existing EP optimizations\nattempt to overlap data communication and computation, which has little benefit\nin low-bandwidth scenarios due to a much longer data communication time.\nTherefore, the trends of cross-DC EP scaling is fast becoming a critical\nroadblock to the continued growth of MoE models.\n  To address this, we propose HybridEP, a modeling-guided framework to optimize\nEP under constrained bandwidth. Our key idea is to dynamically transform the\nspatial placement of experts to reduce data communication traffic and\nfrequency, thereby minimizing EP's communication overheads. However, it is\nnon-trivial to find the optimal solution because it complicates the original\ncommunication pattern by mixing data and expert communication. We therefore\nbuild a stream-based model to determine the optimal transmission ratio. Guided\nby this, we incorporate two techniques: (1) domain-based partition to construct\nthe mapping between hybrid patterns and specific communication topology at GPU\nlevel, and (2) parameter-efficient migration to further refine this topology by\nreducing expert transmission overhead and enlarging the domain size. Combining\nall these designs, HybridEP can be considered as a more general EP with better\nscalability. Experimental results show that HybridEP outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art MoE training systems by up to 5.6x under constrained\nbandwidth. We further compare HybridEP and EP on large-scale simulations.\nHybridEP achieves up to 1.45x speedup with 1k DCs under different bandwidths."}

The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment\nbetween these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation\n(KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence\nbetween the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is\nmisaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance\nrate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target\nmodel's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that\nincorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a\nreference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling\nthe distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on\nsimpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate\nwithout compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse\ntasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and\nsummarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters.\nOur results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across\nall tasks (up to 15\\%).

However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the\n''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their\ncurrent capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent\nzero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses\nthe advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible\nto the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce\nScaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive\ntraining framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a\nmodel's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses\nlearning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,\nranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to\nconstruct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging\nmathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the\npass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative\n44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline.

We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive\n400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is\nconstructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real\nphotographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K\nfrom previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and\ndiversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure\ncomprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content\npreservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring\nand careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables\nresearch into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized\nsubsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential\nediting, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a\n56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;\nand (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction\nrewriting and summarization capabilities.

Hubble models come in standard\nand perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English\ncorpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled\ninsertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to\nemulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard\nand perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B\ntokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency\nof sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password\nappearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password\nin a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text\ninserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without\ncontinued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices\nfor addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the\nsize of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in\ntraining. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range\nof memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how\nreadily different types of private information are memorized. We also\ndemonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed\nfor membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to\nfurther explore, benchmark, and build upon our work."}
