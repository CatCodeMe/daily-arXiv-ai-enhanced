### [1] [World-POI: Global Point-of-Interest Data Enriched from Foursquare and OpenStreetMap as Tabular and Graph Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21342)
*Hossein Amiri,Mohammad Hashemi,Andreas Züfle*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了整合Foursquare和OpenStreetMap POI数据的方法，创建了约1TB的增强数据集，通过名称相似度和空间距离进行记录链接，并提供了可调节阈值的过滤版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foursquare数据集虽然规模庞大但元数据不完整，而OSM数据元数据丰富但缺乏真实性验证，需要整合两者的优势。

Method: 计算Foursquare和OSM POI之间的名称相似度得分和空间距离，识别高置信度匹配，构建基于图的POI表示。

Result: 创建了约1TB的整合数据集，提供了631GB完整版本的重现指南和可调节阈值的过滤版本。

Conclusion: 该方法成功整合了两个数据源的优势，为空间分析和下游应用提供了丰富的POI数据集。

Abstract: Recently, Foursquare released a global dataset with more than 100 million
points of interest (POIs), each representing a real-world business on its
platform. However, many entries lack complete metadata such as addresses or
categories, and some correspond to non-existent or fictional locations. In
contrast, OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a rich, user-contributed POI dataset with
detailed and frequently updated metadata, though it does not formally verify
whether a POI represents an actual business. In this data paper, we present a
methodology that integrates the strengths of both datasets: Foursquare as a
comprehensive baseline of commercial POIs and OSM as a source of enriched
metadata. The combined dataset totals approximately 1 TB. While this full
version is not publicly released, we provide filtered releases with adjustable
thresholds that reduce storage needs and make the data practical to download
and use across domains. We also provide step-by-step instructions to reproduce
the full 631 GB build. Record linkage is achieved by computing name similarity
scores and spatial distances between Foursquare and OSM POIs. These measures
identify and retain high-confidence matches that correspond to real businesses
in Foursquare, have representations in OSM, and show strong name similarity.
Finally, we use this filtered dataset to construct a graph-based representation
of POIs enriched with attributes from both sources, enabling advanced spatial
analyses and a range of downstream applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的药物警戒数据库数据提取技术难度大，现有工具通常只针对单个数据库，需要简化多数据库访问流程。

Method: 采用模块化架构访问异构数据源，提供图形用户界面和程序化访问功能。

Result: 开发了能够访问七个主要药物警戒数据库的统一工具，降低了技术门槛。

Conclusion: SurVigilance通过降低访问安全数据的技术障碍，旨在促进药物警戒研究。

Abstract: Even though several publicly accessible pharmacovigilance databases are
available, extracting data from them is a technically challenging process.
Existing tools typically focus on a single database. We present SurVigilance,
an open-source tool that streamlines the process of retrieving safety data from
seven major pharmacovigilance databases. SurVigilance provides a graphical user
interface as well as functions for programmatic access, thus enabling
integration into existing research workflows. SurVigilance utilizes a modular
architecture to provide access to the heterogeneous sources. By reducing the
technical barriers to accessing safety data, SurVigilance aims to facilitate
pharmacovigilance research.

Abstract: In the past year, generative AI (GenAI) models have received a tremendous
amount of attention, which in turn has increased attention to computing systems
for training and inference for GenAI. Hence, an update to this survey is due.
This paper is an update of the survey of AI accelerators and processors from
past seven years, which is called the Lincoln AI Computing Survey -- LAICS
(pronounced "lace"). This multi-year survey collects and summarizes the current
commercial accelerators that have been publicly announced with peak performance
and peak power consumption numbers. In the same tradition of past papers of
this survey, the performance and power values are plotted on a scatter graph,
and a number of dimensions and observations from the trends on this plot are
again discussed and analyzed. Market segments are highlighted on the scatter
plot, and zoomed plots of each segment are also included. A brief description
of each of the new accelerators that have been added in the survey this year is
included, and this update features a new categorization of computing
architectures that implement each of the accelerators.

### [4] [Towards Straggler-Resilient Split Federated Learning: An Unbalanced Update Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21155)
*Dandan Liang,Jianing Zhang,Evan Chen,Zhe Li,Rui Li,Haibo Yang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出MU-SplitFed算法解决Split Federated Learning中的掉队者问题，通过非平衡更新机制实现线性加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Split Federated Learning结合了联邦学习的并行性和分割学习的计算卸载优势，但面临严重的掉队者问题，特别是服务器端模型更新依赖客户端激活的同步要求导致显著时间延迟

Method: 使用零阶优化的非平衡更新机制，允许服务器在每个客户端轮次中执行τ次本地更新，从而将训练进度与掉队者延迟解耦

Result: 在非凸目标函数上达到O(√(d/(τT)))的收敛速率，实现通信轮次的线性加速τ倍。实验表明MU-SplitFed在存在掉队者时始终优于基线方法

Conclusion: MU-SplitFed通过自适应调整τ值有效缓解掉队者影响，提高了系统的可扩展性和效率

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) enables scalable training on edge devices by
combining the parallelism of Federated Learning (FL) with the computational
offloading of Split Learning (SL). Despite its great success, SFL suffers
significantly from the well-known straggler issue in distributed learning
systems. This problem is exacerbated by the dependency between Split Server and
clients: the Split Server side model update relies on receiving activations
from clients. Such synchronization requirement introduces significant time
latency, making straggler a critical bottleneck to the scalability and
efficiency of the system. To mitigate this problem, we propose MU-SplitFed, a
straggler-resilient SFL algorithm in zeroth-order optimization that decouples
training progress from straggler delays via a simple yet effective unbalanced
update mechanism.
  By enabling the server to perform $\tau$ local updates per client round,
MU-SplitFed achieves a convergence rate of $O(\sqrt{d/(\tau T)})$ for
non-convex objectives, demonstrating a linear speedup of $\tau$ in
communication rounds. Experiments demonstrate that MU-SplitFed consistently
outperforms baseline methods with the presence of stragglers and effectively
mitigates their impact through adaptive tuning of $\tau$. The code for this
project is available at https://github.com/Johnny-Zip/MU-SplitFed.

### [5] [From SLA to vendor-neutral metrics: An intelligent knowledge-based approach for multi-cloud SLA-based broker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21173)
*Víctor Rampérez,Javier Soriano,David Lizcano,Shadi Aljawarneh,Juan A. Lara*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出一个智能知识系统，能够自动将高级SLA转换为供应商中立指标，解决多云环境中的供应商锁定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前云提供商让消费者负责实施服务级别保障机制，但消费者缺乏专业知识。不同云提供商使用不同的低级指标，导致SLA策略绑定特定提供商，阻碍多云环境的优势发挥。

Method: 1) 提出智能知识系统自动翻译高级SLA为供应商中立指标条件；2) 定义供应商中立指标集并说明如何在各云提供商中测量；3) 在由领先云提供商组成的多云环境中验证两个用例(IaaS和PaaS)。

Result: 评估表明，通过两种解决方案的互补性，云消费者可以自动透明地在多云环境中利用多种应用领域，这得到了云专家的认可。

Conclusion: 该解决方案成功解决了多云环境中的SLA翻译问题，使消费者能够跨多个云提供商自动实施服务级别协议，打破供应商锁定。

Abstract: Cloud computing has been consolidated as a support for the vast majority of
current and emerging technologies. However, there are some barriers that
prevent the exploitation of the full potential of this technology. First, the
major cloud providers currently put the onus of implementing the mechanisms
that ensure compliance with the desired service levels on cloud consumers.
However, consumers do not have the required expertise. Since each cloud
provider exports a different set of low-level metrics, the strategies defined
to ensure compliance with the established service-level agreement (SLA) are
bound to a particular cloud provider. This fosters provider lock-in and
prevents consumers from benefiting from the advantages of multi-cloud
environments. This paper presents a solution to the problem of automatically
translating SLAs into objectives expressed as metrics that can be measured
across multiple cloud providers. First, we propose an intelligent
knowledge-based system capable of automatically translating high-level SLAs
defined by cloud consumers into a set of conditions expressed as vendor-neutral
metrics, providing feedback to cloud consumers (intelligent tutoring system).
Secondly, we present the set of vendor-neutral metrics and explain how they can
be measured for the different cloud providers. Finally, we report a validation
based on two use cases (IaaS and PaaS) in a multi-cloud environment formed by
leading cloud providers. This evaluation has demonstrated that, thanks to the
complementarity of the two solutions, cloud consumers can automatically and
transparently exploit the multi-cloud in many application domains, as endorsed
by the cloud experts consulted in the course of this study.

### [6] [Generative Federated Learning for Smart Prediction and Recommendation Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21183)
*Anwesha Mukherjee,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出生成对抗网络与联邦学习结合的GFL模型，用于解决智能预测推荐应用的高响应时间、数据隐私和数据稀缺问题。以心脏健康监测为案例，通过GAN生成合成数据改善数据多样性，在边缘计算中实现集中式和去中心化联邦学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能预测推荐应用中存在的高响应时间、数据隐私泄露和数据稀缺等挑战，特别是在医疗健康监测领域需要平衡隐私保护和模型性能。

Method: 结合生成对抗网络(GAN)和联邦学习，提出GFL框架。使用GAN生成合成数据解决数据稀缺和类别不平衡问题，在边缘计算环境中实现集中式和去中心化两种联邦学习模式。

Result: 相比传统框架，预测准确率提升12%；相比纯云系统，响应时间减少73%。在心脏健康监测应用中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GFL框架有效解决了数据隐私、响应时间和数据稀缺问题，在医疗健康监测等应用中具有显著优势，证明了生成对抗网络与联邦学习结合的价值。

Abstract: This paper proposes a generative adversarial network and federated
learning-based model to address various challenges of the smart prediction and
recommendation applications, such as high response time, compromised data
privacy, and data scarcity. The integration of the generative adversarial
network and federated learning is referred to as Generative Federated Learning
(GFL). As a case study of the proposed model, a heart health monitoring
application is considered. The realistic synthetic datasets are generated using
the generated adversarial network-based proposed algorithm for improving data
diversity, data quality, and data augmentation, and remove the data scarcity
and class imbalance issues. In this paper, we implement the centralized and
decentralized federated learning approaches in an edge computing paradigm. In
centralized federated learning, the edge nodes communicate with the central
server to build the global and personalized local models in a collaborative
manner. In the decentralized federated learning approach, the edge nodes
communicate among themselves to exchange model updates for collaborative
training. The comparative study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
the existing heart health monitoring applications. The results show that using
the proposed framework (i) the prediction accuracy is improved by 12% than the
conventional framework, and (ii) the response time is reduced by 73% than the
conventional cloud-only system.

### [7] [Arbitration-Free Consistency is Available (and Vice Versa)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21304)
*Hagit Attiya,Constantin Enea,Enrique Román-Calvo*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个通用语义框架，将操作语义和一致性模型结合，证明了仲裁自由一致性(AFC)定理：对象规范在一致性模型中允许可用实现当且仅当它是仲裁自由的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式存储系统中可用性和一致性之间存在基本张力，现有理论只覆盖了简单读写接口的极端情况，缺乏对对象语义和一致性模型组合的精确解释。

Method: 开发了一个通用语义框架，涵盖各种对象(键值存储、计数器、集合、CRDTs、事务数据库)和一致性模型(从因果一致性到快照隔离等)。

Result: 证明了AFC定理，揭示了仲裁自由是区分无协调一致性和固有同步行为的基本属性。

Conclusion: AFC定理统一并推广了先前结果，仲裁自由成为协调自由一致性的根本决定因素。

Abstract: The fundamental tension between \emph{availability} and \emph{consistency}
shapes the design of distributed storage systems. Classical results capture
extreme points of this trade-off: the CAP theorem shows that strong models like
linearizability preclude availability under partitions, while weak models like
causal consistency remain implementable without coordination. These theorems
apply to simple read-write interfaces, leaving open a precise explanation of
the combinations of object semantics and consistency models that admit
available implementations.
  This paper develops a general semantic framework in which storage
specifications combine operation semantics and consistency models. The
framework encompasses a broad range of objects (key-value stores, counters,
sets, CRDTs, and transactional databases) and consistency models (from causal
consistency and sequential consistency to snapshot isolation and transactional
and non-transactional SQL).
  Within this framework, we prove the \emph{Arbitration-Free Consistency} (AFC)
theorem, showing that an object specification within a consistency model admits
an available implementation if and only if it is \emph{arbitration-free}, that
is, it does not require a total arbitration order to resolve visibility or read
dependencies.
  The AFC theorem unifies and generalizes previous results, revealing
arbitration-freedom as the fundamental property that delineates
coordination-free consistency from inherently synchronized behavior.

### [8] [Parsley's Group Size Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21348)
*João A. Silva,Hervé Paulino,João M. Lourenço*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Parsley是一种基于组的弹性分布式哈希表，通过主动对等节点重定位技术和动态数据分片机制来提高鲁棒性和负载均衡。除了硬性的组大小限制外，还引入了软限制来维持稳定的组规模，在节点变动下提升系统稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统在指定组大小限制时缺乏理论依据，本文旨在通过系统性的覆盖网络特性研究来理解这些参数对性能和可扩展性的影响，为参数选择提供合理依据。

Method: 采用预对等节点重定位技术和动态数据分片机制，引入软硬两种组大小限制，进行覆盖网络特性研究分析拓扑操作、大组行为和整体权衡。

Result: 通过系统性研究揭示了参数对系统性能的影响，提供了配置值选择的合理依据，相比相关系统具有更好的理论基础。

Conclusion: Parsley通过软硬限制结合和系统性参数分析，在节点变动环境下实现了更好的系统稳定性和性能表现，为分布式哈希表的设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Parsley is a resilient group-based Distributed Hash Table that incorporates a
preemptive peer relocation technique and a dynamic data sharding mechanism to
enhance robustness and balance. In addition to the hard limits on group size,
defined by minimum and maximum thresholds, Parsley introduces two soft limits
that define a target interval for maintaining stable group sizes. These soft
boundaries allow the overlay to take proactive measures to prevent violations
of the hard limits, improving system stability under churn. This work provides
an in-depth analysis of the rationale behind the parameter values adopted for
Parsley's evaluation. Unlike related systems, which specify group size limits
without justification, we conduct a systematic overlay characterization study
to understand the effects of these parameters on performance and scalability.
The study examines topology operations, the behavior of large groups, and the
overall trade-offs observed, offering a grounded explanation for the chosen
configuration values.

### [9] [LIDC: A Location Independent Multi-Cluster Computing Framework for Data Intensive Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21373)
*Sankalpa Timilsina,Susmit Shannigrahi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用语义名称的分布式控制平面，用于在地理分散的计算集群上部署计算任务，替代传统的集中式Kubernetes控制器方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前集中式控制器方法不适合多组织协作环境，且工作流通常需要手动配置，无法适应基础设施的动态变化。

Method: 通过为计算任务分配语义名称，将其与命名的Kubernetes服务端点匹配，实现去中心化的计算部署控制。

Result: 该方法使计算作业部署与位置无关，任何有足够资源的集群都能执行计算，并支持动态计算部署而无需预先了解集群位置或预定义配置。

Conclusion: 基于语义名称的分布式控制平面能够有效解决多组织协作环境中的计算部署问题，提供灵活性和适应性。

Abstract: Scientific communities are increasingly using geographically distributed
computing platforms. The current methods of compute placement predominantly use
logically centralized controllers such as Kubernetes (K8s) to match tasks to
available resources. However, this centralized approach is unsuitable in
multi-organizational collaborations. Furthermore, workflows often need to use
manual configurations tailored for a single platform and cannot adapt to
dynamic changes across infrastructure. Our work introduces a decentralized
control plane for placing computations on geographically dispersed compute
clusters using semantic names. We assign semantic names to computations to
match requests with named Kubernetes (K8s) service endpoints. We show that this
approach provides multiple benefits. First, it allows placement of
computational jobs to be independent of location, enabling any cluster with
sufficient resources to execute the computation. Second, it facilitates dynamic
compute placement without requiring prior knowledge of cluster locations or
predefined configurations.

### [10] [Learning to Schedule: A Supervised Learning Framework for Network-Aware Scheduling of Data-Intensive Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21419)
*Sankalpa Timilsina,Susmit Shannigrahi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于监督学习的网络感知作业调度器，通过预测作业完成时间来优化分布式云环境中的作业放置决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式云环境中网络拥塞、带宽不对称和节点间数据混洗等因素导致作业性能下降，传统基于CPU/内存的主机级指标无法捕获这些网络条件，导致调度决策不佳。

Method: 使用监督学习预测候选作业的完成时间，通过预测-排序机制收集所有节点的实时遥测数据，使用训练好的监督模型估计每个节点的作业持续时间，并排序选择最佳放置位置。

Result: 在FABRIC测试平台上部署的地理分布式Kubernetes集群上评估，相比默认Kubernetes调度器，提出的监督调度器在选择最优节点进行作业放置时实现了34-54%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 研究展示了监督学习在多站点集群中实现实时、网络感知作业调度的可行性，为优化分布式云环境中的作业性能提供了新方法。

Abstract: Distributed cloud environments hosting data-intensive applications often
experience slowdowns due to network congestion, asymmetric bandwidth, and
inter-node data shuffling. These factors are typically not captured by
traditional host-level metrics like CPU or memory. Scheduling without
accounting for these conditions can lead to poor placement decisions, longer
data transfers, and suboptimal job performance. We present a network-aware job
scheduler that uses supervised learning to predict the completion time of
candidate jobs. Our system introduces a prediction-and-ranking mechanism that
collects real-time telemetry from all nodes, uses a trained supervised model to
estimate job duration per node, and ranks them to select the best placement. We
evaluate the scheduler on a geo-distributed Kubernetes cluster deployed on the
FABRIC testbed by running network-intensive Spark workloads. Compared to the
default Kubernetes scheduler, which makes placement decisions based on current
resource availability alone, our proposed supervised scheduler achieved 34-54%
higher accuracy in selecting optimal nodes for job placement. The novelty of
our work lies in the demonstration of supervised learning for real-time,
network-aware job scheduling on a multi-site cluster.

### [11] [On Reduction and Synthesis of Petri's Cycloids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21493)
*Rüdiger Valk,Daniel Moldt*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文研究了用于建模动作和事件过程的循环体（cycloids）Petri网，定义了循环体的归约系统，证明了不可约循环体的性质，并推导出从Petri网结构合成循环体参数的方法，从而实现了高效的循环体同构判定过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环体是Petri网的特殊类型，用于建模动作和事件过程，是Petri一般系统理论的基础。通过四个参数提供代数形式来描述强同步的顺序过程，需要进一步研究其结构特性。

Method: 定义了类似重写系统的循环体归约系统，证明了不可约循环体的性质，并推导出从Petri网结构合成循环体参数的方法。

Result: 开发了高效的循环体同构判定程序，能够从Petri网结构合成循环体参数。

Conclusion: 通过归约系统和参数合成方法，为循环体结构分析提供了有效的工具，实现了高效的循环体同构判定。

Abstract: Cycloids are particular Petri nets for modelling processes of actions and
events, belonging to the fundaments of Petri's general systems theory. Defined
by four parameters they provide an algebraic formalism to describe strongly
synchronized sequential processes. To further investigate their structure,
reduction systems of cycloids are defined in the style of rewriting systems and
properties of irreducible cycloids are proved. In particular the synthesis of
cycloid parameters from their Petri net structure is derived, leading to an
efficient method for a decision procedure for cycloid isomorphism.

### [12] [Distributed $(Δ+1)$-Coloring in Graphs of Bounded Neighborhood Independence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21549)
*Marc Fuchs,Fabian Kuhn*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文显著改进了具有低邻域独立数θ的图中(Δ+1)-着色问题的确定性分布式算法复杂度，从2^O(√logΔ)提升到(θ·logΔ)^O(loglogΔ/logloglogΔ)轮，当θ为polylog(Δ)时达到准多对数时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管分布式着色问题已被广泛研究，但确定(Δ+1)-着色的确定性复杂度仍是该领域最重要的开放问题之一。本文旨在通过研究邻域独立数θ较小的特殊图类来改进对(Δ+1)-着色复杂度的理解。

Method: 针对邻域独立数θ的图，开发了新的分布式算法，将(Δ+1)-着色问题的轮数复杂度从指数级改进为准多对数级。

Result: 证明了在邻域独立数为θ的图中，(Δ+1)-着色可以在(θ·logΔ)^O(loglogΔ/logloglogΔ)+O(log* n)轮内完成，当θ≤polylog(Δ)时达到准多对数时间。

Conclusion: 本文显著推进了对(Δ+1)-着色确定性复杂度的理解，特别是在低邻域独立数图类中取得了突破性进展，同时指出现有方法无法推广到超图边着色问题。

Abstract: The distributed coloring problem is arguably one of the key problems studied
in the area of distributed graph algorithms. The most standard variant of the
problem asks for a proper vertex coloring of a graph with $\Delta+1$ colors,
where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. Despite an immense amount of
work on distributed coloring problems in the distributed setting, determining
the deterministic complexity of $(\Delta+1)$-coloring in the standard message
passing model remains one of the most important open questions of the area. In
this paper, we aim to improve our understanding of the deterministic complexity
of $(\Delta+1)$-coloring as a function of $\Delta$ in a special family of
graphs for which significantly faster algorithms are already known. The
neighborhood independence $\theta$ of a graph is the maximum number of pairwise
non-adjacent neighbors of some node of the graph. In general, in graphs of
neighborhood independence $\theta=O(1)$ (e.g., line graphs), it is known that
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring can be solved in $2^{O(\sqrt{\log\Delta})}+O(\log^* n)$
rounds. In the present paper, we significantly improve this result, and we show
that in graphs of neighborhood independence $\theta$, a $(\Delta+1)$-coloring
can be computed in $(\theta\cdot\log\Delta)^{O(\log\log\Delta /
\log\log\log\Delta)}+O(\log^* n)$ rounds and thus in quasipolylogarithmic time
in $\Delta$ as long as $\theta$ is at most polylogarithmic in $\Delta$. We also
show that the known approach that leads to a polylogarithmic in $\Delta$
algorithm for $(2\Delta-1)$-edge coloring already fails for edge colorings of
hypergraphs of rank at least $3$.

### [13] [Hardness of Approximation for Shortest Path with Vector Costs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21058)
*Charlie Carlson,Yury Makarychev,Ron Mosenzon*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文研究了ℓ_p-最短路径问题的近似计算难度，对于p∈[2,∞)证明了Ω(p(log n/log²log n)^{1-1/p})的近似下界，对于p=∞证明了Ω(log² n)的近似下界，这些结果几乎匹配了已知的近似算法上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ℓ_p-最短路径问题的近似计算难度，填补了p<∞时缺乏近似下界结果的空白，并改进p=∞时的下界结果。

Method: 通过理论分析和证明技术，建立了ℓ_p-最短路径问题的近似计算下界，并推导了高阶Bell数的渐近界。

Result: 对于p∈[2,∞)，证明了Ω(p(log n/log²log n)^{1-1/p})的近似下界；对于p=∞，证明了Ω(log² n)的近似下界，这些结果几乎匹配了已知的近似算法上界。

Conclusion: 本文为ℓ_p-最短路径问题建立了紧的近似计算难度界限，填补了该领域的重要空白，并提供了可能具有独立价值的高阶Bell数渐近界。

Abstract: We obtain hardness of approximation results for the $\ell_p$-Shortest Path
problem, a variant of the classic Shortest Path problem with vector costs. For
every integer $p \in [2,\infty)$, we show a hardness of $\Omega(p(\log n /
\log^2\log n)^{1-1/p})$ for both polynomial- and quasi-polynomial-time
approximation algorithms. This nearly matches the approximation factor of
$O(p(\log n / \log\log n)^{1-1/p})$ achieved by a quasi-polynomial-time
algorithm of Makarychev, Ovsiankin, and Tani (ICALP 2025). No hardness of
approximation results were previously known for any $p < \infty$. We also
present results for the case where $p$ is a function of $n$. For $p = \infty$,
we establish a hardness of $\tilde\Omega(\log^2 n)$, improving upon the
previous $\tilde\Omega(\log n)$ hardness result. Our result nearly matches the
$O(\log^2 n)$ approximation guarantee of the quasi-polynomial-time algorithm by
Li, Xu, and Zhang (ICALP 2025). Finally, we present asymptotic bounds on
higher-order Bell numbers, which might be of independent interest.

<details>

Motivation: 解决在噪声值预言机下最大化子模函数的问题，现有方法对特定约束有近似保证，但缺乏通用框架。

Method: 设计元算法，将鲁棒的精确子模最大化算法作为黑盒，转换为噪声环境下的算法。使用测量连续贪婪算法和双贪婪算法作为具体实现。

Result: 对于单调子模函数在拟阵约束下获得(1-1/e)近似，非单调获得1/e近似；无约束非单调子模最大化获得1/2近似。

Conclusion: 该元算法提供了一个通用框架，将精确子模最大化算法扩展到噪声环境，同时保持了原有的近似保证。

Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing a submodular function with access to a
noisy value oracle for the function instead of an exact value oracle. Similar
to prior work, we assume that the noisy oracle is persistent in that multiple
calls to the oracle for a specific set always return the same value. In this
model, Hassidim and Singer (2017) design a $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm
for monotone submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint, and
Huang et al (2022) design a $(1-1/e)/2$-approximation algorithm for monotone
submodular maximization subject to any arbitrary matroid constraint. In this
paper, we design a meta-algorithm that allows us to take any "robust" algorithm
for exact submodular maximization as a black box and transform it into an
algorithm for the noisy setting while retaining the approximation guarantee. By
using the meta-algorithm with the measured continuous greedy algorithm, we
obtain a $(1-1/e)$-approximation (resp. $1/e$-approximation) for monotone
(resp. non-monotone) submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint
under noise. Furthermore, by using the meta-algorithm with the double greedy
algorithm, we obtain a $1/2$-approximation for unconstrained (non-monotone)
submodular maximization under noise.

Motivation: Goemans关于单源不可分割流的著名猜想一直进展有限，Morell和Skutella提出了替代猜想，本文旨在研究这两个猜想之间的关系。

Method: 推广了Linhares和Swamy的技术，使用初等证明方法替代拉格朗日对偶，并将该技术应用于加权环加载问题。

Result: 证明了Morell和Skutella的猜想蕴含Goemans的猜想（违反程度为最大需求的两倍），并展示了该技术在加权环加载问题中可将无成本保证的近似算法转化为具有额外成本保证的近似算法。

Conclusion: 提出的技术不仅解决了两个猜想之间的关系问题，还具有独立的理论价值，并能应用于其他优化问题中。

Abstract: A famous conjecture of Goemans on single-source unsplittable flows states
that one can turn any fractional flow into an unsplittable one of no higher
cost, while increasing the load on any arc by at most the maximum demand.
Despite extensive work on the topic, only limited progress has been made.
Recently, Morell and Skutella suggested an alternative conjecture, stating that
one can turn any fractional flow into an unsplittable one without changing the
load on any arc by more than the maximum demand.
  We show that their conjecture implies Goemans' conjecture (with a violation
of twice the maximum demand). To this end, we generalize a technique of
Linhares and Swamy, used to obtain a low-cost chain-constrained spanning tree
from an algorithm without cost guarantees. Whereas Linhares and Swamy's proof
relies on Langrangian duality, we provide a very simple elementary proof of a
generalized version, which we hope to be of independent interest. Moreover, we
show how this technique can also be used in the context of the weighted ring
loading problem, showing that cost-unaware approximation algorithms can be
transformed into approximation algorithms with additional cost guarantees.

Abstract: Understanding the role of randomness when solving locally checkable labeling
(LCL) problems in the LOCAL model has been one of the top priorities in the
research on distributed graph algorithms in recent years. For LCL problems in
bounded-degree graphs, it is known that randomness cannot help more than
polynomially, except in one case: if the deterministic complexity of an LCL
problem is in $\Omega(\log n)$ and its randomized complexity is in $o(\log n)$,
then the randomized complexity is guaranteed to be $poly(\log \log n)$.
However, the fundamental question of \emph{which} problems with a deterministic
complexity of $\Omega(\log n)$ can be solved exponentially faster using
randomization still remains wide open.
  We make a step towards answering this question by studying a simple, but
natural class of LCL problems: so-called degree splitting problems. These
problems come in two varieties: coloring problems where the edges of a graph
have to be colored with $2$ colors and orientation problems where each edge
needs to be oriented. For $\Delta$-regular graphs (where $\Delta=O(1)$), we
obtain the following results.
  - We gave an exact characterization of the randomized complexity of all
problems where the edges need to be colored with two colors, say red and blue,
and which have a deterministic complexity of $O(\log n)$. - For edge
orientation problems, we give a partial characterization of the problems that
have a randomized complexity of $\Omega(\log n)$ and the problems that have a
randomized complexity of $poly\log\log n$.
  While our results are cleanest to state for the $\Delta$-regular case, all
our algorithms naturally generalize to nodes of any degree $d<\Delta$ in
general graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$.

*Linh Anh Nguyen*

TL;DR: 提出了第一个在Gödel语义下最小化有限模糊解释的算法，支持近似保持模糊概念断言，时间复杂度为O((m log l + n) log n)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最小化模糊解释在理论和实践中都很重要，例如模糊社交网络的建模，更紧凑的表示能显著提高知识系统中推理和分析任务的效率。

Method: 设计了一种算法，在Gödel语义下最小化有限模糊解释，同时保持模糊概念断言，支持近似保持到指定程度γ∈(0,1]。

Result: 算法在fALC子逻辑到扩展fALC_reg的FDLs范围内有效，时间复杂度为O((m log l + n) log n)，其中n是域大小，m是非零原子角色实例数，l是使用的不同模糊值数量加2。

Conclusion: 这是第一个在Gödel语义下最小化模糊解释的算法，支持近似保持，为模糊描述逻辑中的高效推理提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The problem of minimizing fuzzy interpretations in fuzzy description logics
(FDLs) is important both theoretically and practically. For instance, fuzzy or
weighted social networks can be modeled as fuzzy interpretations, where
individuals represent actors and roles capture interactions. Minimizing such
interpretations yields more compact representations, which can significantly
improve the efficiency of reasoning and analysis tasks in knowledge-based
systems. We present the first algorithm that minimizes a finite fuzzy
interpretation while preserving fuzzy concept assertions in FDLs without the
Baaz projection operator and the universal role, under the G\"odel semantics.
The considered class of FDLs ranges from the sublogic of $f\!\mathcal{ALC}$
without the union operator and universal restriction to the FDL that extends
$f\!\mathcal{ALC}_{reg}$ with inverse roles and nominals. Our algorithm is
given in an extended form that supports approximate preservation: it minimizes
a finite fuzzy interpretation $\mathcal{I}$ while preserving fuzzy concept
assertions up to a degree $\gamma \in (0,1]$. Its time complexity is
$O((m\log{l} + n)\log{n})$, where $n$ is the size of the domain of
$\mathcal{I}$, $m$ is the number of nonzero instances of atomic roles in
$\mathcal{I}$, and $l$ is the number of distinct fuzzy values used in such
instances plus 2.

Abstract: We study a network design problem motivated by the challenge of placing
wildlife crossings to reconnect fragmented habitats of animal species, which is
among the 17 goals towards sustainable development by the UN: Given a graph,
whose vertices represent the fragmented habitat areas and whose edges represent
possible green bridge locations (with costs), and the habitable vertex set for
each species' habitat, the goal is to find the cheapest set of edges such that
each species' habitat is sufficiently connected. We focus on the established
variant where a habitat is considered sufficiently connected if it has diameter
two in the solution and study its complexity in cases justified by our setting
namely small habitat sizes on planar graphs and graphs of small maximum degree
$\Delta$. We provide efficient algorithms and NP-hardness results for different
values of $\Delta$ and maximum habitat sizes on general and planar graphs.

Conclusion: 按书分析框架克服了平滑分析的几个弱点，能够更好地解释算法在实际中的优异性能。

Abstract: Narrowing the gap between theory and practice is a longstanding goal of the
algorithm analysis community. To further progress our understanding of how
algorithms work in practice, we propose a new algorithm analysis framework that
we call by the book analysis. In contrast to earlier frameworks, by the book
analysis not only models an algorithm's input data, but also the algorithm
itself. Results from by the book analysis are meant to correspond well with
established knowledge of an algorithm's practical behavior, as they are meant
to be grounded in observations from implementations, input modeling best
practices, and measurements on practical benchmark instances. We apply our
framework to the simplex method, an algorithm which is beloved for its
excellent performance in practice and notorious for its high running time under
worst-case analysis. The simplex method similarly showcased the state of the
art framework smoothed analysis (Spielman and Teng, STOC'01). We explain how
our framework overcomes several weaknesses of smoothed analysis and we prove
that under input scaling assumptions, feasibility tolerances and other design
principles used by simplex method implementations, the simplex method indeed
attains a polynomial running time.

Conclusion: AgentArcEval方法能够有效解决基于基础模型的智能体架构评估的复杂性，为智能体架构设计和评估提供了系统指导。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models (FMs) has enabled the development of
highly capable and autonomous agents, unlocking new application opportunities
across a wide range of domains. Evaluating the architecture of agents is
particularly important as the architectural decisions significantly impact the
quality attributes of agents given their unique characteristics, including
compound architecture, autonomous and non-deterministic behaviour, and
continuous evolution. However, these traditional methods fall short in
addressing the evaluation needs of agent architecture due to the unique
characteristics of these agents. Therefore, in this paper, we present
AgentArcEval, a novel agent architecture evaluation method designed specially
to address the complexities of FM-based agent architecture and its evaluation.
Moreover, we present a catalogue of agent-specific general scenarios, which
serves as a guide for generating concrete scenarios to design and evaluate the
agent architecture. We demonstrate the usefulness of AgentArcEval and the
catalogue through a case study on the architecture evaluation of a real-world
tax copilot, named Luna.

Motivation: 现有代码差异工具在识别跨多行的块级编辑操作时存在局限，只能将其表示为离散的行级操作序列，这严重影响了开发人员理解代码变更的效率。

Method: 基于传统差异算法，首先构建包含所有可能行映射和块映射的候选集，然后使用Kuhn-Munkres算法计算最优映射集，以最小化编辑脚本大小并贴近开发者原始意图。

Result: 实验表明BDiff在编辑脚本大小、结果质量和运行时间方面优于包括大语言模型在内的五种最先进工具，同时保持竞争力的运行时性能。

Conclusion: BDiff能够有效识别块级编辑操作，显著提升代码差异分析质量，同时实验显示大语言模型在代码差异任务中结果质量不可靠且运行效率不可行。

Abstract: Code differencing is a fundamental technique in software engineering practice
and research. While researchers have proposed text-based differencing
techniques capable of identifying line changes over the past decade, existing
methods exhibit a notable limitation in identifying edit actions (EAs) that
operate on text blocks spanning multiple lines. Such EAs are common in
developers' practice, such as moving a code block for conditional branching or
duplicating a method definition block for overloading. Existing tools represent
such block-level operations as discrete sequences of line-level EAs, compelling
developers to manually correlate them and thereby substantially impeding the
efficiency of change comprehension. To address this issue, we propose BDiff, a
text-based differencing algorithm capable of identifying two types of
block-level EAs and five types of line-level EAs. Building on traditional
differencing algorithms, we first construct a candidate set containing all
possible line mappings and block mappings. Leveraging the Kuhn-Munkres
algorithm, we then compute the optimal mapping set that can minimize the size
of the edit script (ES) while closely aligning with the original developer's
intent. To validate the effectiveness of BDiff, we selected five
state-of-the-art tools, including large language models (LLMs), as baselines
and adopted a combined qualitative and quantitative approach to evaluate their
performance in terms of ES size, result quality, and running time. Experimental
results show that BDiff produces higher-quality differencing results than
baseline tools while maintaining competitive runtime performance. Our
experiments also show the unreliability of LLMs in code differencing tasks
regarding result quality and their infeasibility in terms of runtime
efficiency. We have implemented a web-based visual differencing tool.

TL;DR: R2ComSync是一个基于检索和重排序的代码-注释同步方法，通过集成混合检索和多轮重排序策略，利用大语言模型提升代码注释同步的性能和质量。

Motivation: 现有代码-注释同步方法存在泛化能力不足或需要大量任务特定学习资源的问题，而大语言模型虽然在该领域有潜力，但缺乏有效的上下文学习演示和正确候选优先排序机制。

Method: 提出R2ComSync方法，包含两个创新：1）集成混合检索，同时考虑代码-注释语义和变更模式的相似性；2）多轮重排序策略，通过分析大规模样本推导出的三个重要规则来优先选择正确候选。

Result: 在三个涵盖Java和Python的CCS数据集上评估，使用五个最新的大语言模型，与五个最先进方法比较，实验显示R2ComSync性能优越，生成的注释质量显著更高。

Conclusion: R2ComSync通过检索增强的上下文学习和多轮重排序策略，有效解决了大语言模型在代码-注释同步中的局限性，实现了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Code-Comment Synchronization (CCS) aims to synchronize the comments with code
changes in an automated fashion, thereby significantly reducing the workload of
developers during software maintenance and evolution. While previous studies
have proposed various solutions that have shown success, they often exhibit
limitations, such as a lack of generalization ability or the need for extensive
task-specific learning resources. This motivates us to investigate the
potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this area. However, a pilot
analysis proves that LLMs fall short of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) CCS approaches
because (1) they lack instructive demonstrations for In-Context Learning (ICL)
and (2) many correct-prone candidates are not prioritized.To tackle the above
challenges, we propose R2ComSync, an ICL-based code-Comment Synchronization
approach enhanced with Retrieval and Re-ranking. Specifically, R2ComSync
carries corresponding two novelties: (1) Ensemble hybrid retrieval. It equally
considers the similarity in both code-comment semantics and change patterns
when retrieval, thereby creating ICL prompts with effective examples. (2)
Multi-turn re-ranking strategy. We derived three significant rules through
large-scale CCS sample analysis. Given the inference results of LLMs, it
progressively exploits three re-ranking rules to prioritize relatively
correct-prone candidates. We evaluate R2ComSync using five recent LLMs on three
CCS datasets covering both Java and Python programming languages, and make
comparisons with five SOTA approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of R2ComSync against other approaches. Moreover, both
quantitative and qualitative analyses provide compelling evidence that the
comments synchronized by our proposal exhibit significantly higher quality.}

C/CPP compiler's glibc malloc and Google's TCMalloc. Across diverse workloads,
our empirical results show up to 4.1 percantage reduction in average heap usage
without loss of runtime efficiency; indeed, we get a 0.25 percantage reduction.

Abstract: GenAI-based coding assistants have disrupted software development. Their next
generation is agent-based, operating with more autonomy and potentially without
human oversight. One challenge is to provide AI agents with sufficient context
about the software projects they operate in. Like humans, AI agents require
contextual information to develop solutions that are in line with the target
architecture, interface specifications, coding guidelines, standard workflows,
and other project-specific policies. Popular AI agents for software development
(e.g., Claude Code) advocate for maintaining tool-specific version-controlled
Markdown files that cover aspects such as the project structure, building and
testing, or code style. The content of these files is automatically added to
each prompt. AGENTS.md has emerged as a potential standard that consolidates
tool-specific formats. However, little is known about whether and how
developers adopt this format. Therefore, in this paper, we present the results
of a preliminary study investigating the adoption of AI configuration files in
466 open-source software projects, what information developers provide in these
files, how they present that information, and how they evolve over time. Our
findings indicate that there is no established structure yet, and that there is
a lot of variation in terms of how context is provided (descriptive,
prescriptive, prohibitive, explanatory, conditional). We see great potential in
studying which modifications in structure or presentation can positively affect
the quality of the generated content. Finally, our analysis of commits that
have modified AGENTS.md files provides first insights into how projects
continuously extend and maintain these files. We conclude the paper by
outlining how the adoption of AI configuration files in provides a unique
opportunity to study real-world prompt and context engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需求工程任务中表现出色，但存在计算成本高、数据共享风险和依赖外部服务的问题。小型语言模型提供了轻量级、本地可部署的替代方案。

Method: 比较了8个模型（3个LLM和5个SLM）在PROMISE、PROMISE Reclass和SecReq数据集上的需求分类任务表现。

Result: LLMs的平均F1分数比SLMs高2%，但差异不显著。SLMs在所有数据集上几乎达到LLMs的性能，在PROMISE Reclass数据集上的召回率甚至超过LLMs，尽管模型大小最多小300倍。数据集特征比模型大小对性能影响更大。

Conclusion: SLMs是需求分类任务中LLMs的有效替代方案，在隐私、成本和本地部署方面具有优势。

Abstract: [Context and motivation] Large language models (LLMs) show notable results in
natural language processing (NLP) tasks for requirements engineering (RE).
However, their use is compromised by high computational cost, data sharing
risks, and dependence on external services. In contrast, small language models
(SLMs) offer a lightweight, locally deployable alternative. [Question/problem]
It remains unclear how well SLMs perform compared to LLMs in RE tasks in terms
of accuracy. [Results] Our preliminary study compares eight models, including
three LLMs and five SLMs, on requirements classification tasks using the
PROMISE, PROMISE Reclass, and SecReq datasets. Our results show that although
LLMs achieve an average F1 score of 2% higher than SLMs, this difference is not
statistically significant. SLMs almost reach LLMs performance across all
datasets and even outperform them in recall on the PROMISE Reclass dataset,
despite being up to 300 times smaller. We also found that dataset
characteristics play a more significant role in performance than model size.
[Contribution] Our study contributes with evidence that SLMs are a valid
alternative to LLMs for requirements classification, offering advantages in
privacy, cost, and local deployability.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) plays a key role in autonomous driving systems. DL models
support perception modules, equipped with tasks such as object detection and
sensor fusion. These DL models enable vehicles to process multi-sensor inputs
to understand complex surroundings. Deploying DL models in autonomous driving
systems faces stringent challenges, including real-time processing, limited
computational resources, and strict power constraints. To address these
challenges, automotive DL frameworks (e.g., PaddleInference) have emerged to
optimize inference efficiency. However, these frameworks encounter unique
quality issues due to their more complex deployment environments, such as
crashes stemming from limited scheduled memory and incorrect memory allocation.
Unfortunately, existing DL framework testing methods fail to detect these
quality issues due to the failure in deploying generated test input models, as
these models lack three essential capabilities: (1) multi-input/output tensor
processing, (2) multi-modal data processing, and (3) multi-level data feature
extraction. These capabilities necessitate specialized model components, which
existing testing methods neglect during model generation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Scalpel, an automotive DL frameworks testing method that generates
test input models at the model component level. Scalpel generates models by
assembling model components (heads, necks, backbones) to support capabilities
required by autonomous driving systems. Specifically, Scalpel maintains and
updates a repository of model components, generating test inputs by selecting,
mutating, and assembling them. Successfully generated models are added back to
enrich the repository. Newly generated models are then deployed within the
autonomous driving system to test automotive DL frameworks via differential
testing.

TL;DR: 提出使用社会技术模型来支持软件供应链的自适应威胁检测，通过分析XZ Utils攻击案例说明监控技术和社会数据可以识别可疑行为趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件供应链攻击日益增多，但由于其复杂性，传统的漏洞分析面临挑战。现有工作主要关注技术层面的依赖监控和组件控制，缺乏对社会技术动态的理解来指导威胁检测。

Method: 提出开发和研究社会技术模型的方法，通过监控技术和社会数据（如GitHub活动和邮件列表）来识别可疑行为趋势，从而指导有针对性的漏洞评估。

Result: 通过XZ Utils攻击案例的分析，证明了监控社会技术数据可以识别恶意行为模式，如攻击者通过破坏维护者信任来渗透项目。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究开发者分析、软件分析、去中心化适应等技术，并建立软件供应链安全研究的测试平台，以实现基于社会技术模型的自适应威胁检测愿景。

Abstract: Software supply chains (SSCs) are complex systems composed of dynamic,
heterogeneous technical and social components which collectively achieve the
production and maintenance of software artefacts. Attacks on SSCs are
increasing, yet pervasive vulnerability analysis is challenging due to their
complexity. Therefore, threat detection must be targeted, to account for the
large and dynamic structure, and adaptive, to account for its change and
diversity. While current work focuses on technical approaches for monitoring
supply chain dependencies and establishing component controls, approaches which
inform threat detection through understanding the socio-technical dynamics are
lacking. We outline a position and research vision to develop and investigate
the use of socio-technical models to support adaptive threat detection of SSCs.
We motivate this approach through an analysis of the XZ Utils attack whereby
malicious actors undermined the maintainers' trust via the project's GitHub and
mailing lists. We highlight that monitoring technical and social data can
identify trends which indicate suspicious behaviour to then inform targeted and
intensive vulnerability assessment. We identify challenges and research
directions to achieve this vision considering techniques for developer and
software analysis, decentralised adaptation and the need for a test bed for
software supply chain security research.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了BenchRisk框架，用于评估大型语言模型基准测试的风险，识别了57种潜在故障模式和196种缓解策略，帮助用户更准确地评估LLM基准的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM基准测试的可靠性受到多种故障模式的影响，可能导致用户对LLM能力做出错误判断。需要系统性的方法来评估基准测试风险。

Method: 基于NIST风险管理流程，迭代分析26个流行基准，识别故障模式和缓解策略，开发BenchRisk评分系统评估五个维度风险。

Result: 所有26个基准测试在一个或多个维度上都存在显著风险，BenchRisk提供了基准比较和风险识别工具。

Conclusion: LLM基准测试领域存在重要研究空白，BenchRisk框架有助于识别和分享风险及其缓解措施，提高基准测试的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) benchmarks inform LLM use decisions (e.g., "is
this LLM safe to deploy for my use case and context?"). However, benchmarks may
be rendered unreliable by various failure modes that impact benchmark bias,
variance, coverage, or people's capacity to understand benchmark evidence.
Using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's risk management
process as a foundation, this research iteratively analyzed 26 popular
benchmarks, identifying 57 potential failure modes and 196 corresponding
mitigation strategies. The mitigations reduce failure likelihood and/or
severity, providing a frame for evaluating "benchmark risk," which is scored to
provide a metaevaluation benchmark: BenchRisk. Higher scores indicate that
benchmark users are less likely to reach an incorrect or unsupported conclusion
about an LLM. All 26 scored benchmarks present significant risk within one or
more of the five scored dimensions (comprehensiveness, intelligibility,
consistency, correctness, and longevity), which points to important open
research directions for the field of LLM benchmarking. The BenchRisk workflow
allows for comparison between benchmarks; as an open-source tool, it also
facilitates the identification and sharing of risks and their mitigations.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究表明，通过多样性策略组合多个编码LLM可以达到比单一最佳模型高83%的理论性能上限，而基于共识的策略会陷入"流行度陷阱"放大错误输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前追求单一大型语言模型处理所有软件工程任务既资源密集又忽视了模型互补性的潜力，但缺乏关于编码LLM如何互补以及最佳集成策略的实证研究。

Method: 实证比较了来自5个家族的10个个体LLM和3个集成模型，在代码生成和程序修复等3个软件工程基准上进行评估，测试了模型间的互补性和各种选择启发式方法。

Result: 集成模型的理论性能上限比最佳单一模型高83%，基于共识的策略会放大常见但错误的输出，而基于多样性的策略能实现高达95%的理论潜力，即使在小型两模型集成中也有效。

Conclusion: 多样性策略为利用多个LLM提升性能提供了成本效益高的方法，使小型模型集成也能显著增强性能，超越了单一模型系统的局限性。

Abstract: Today's pursuit of a single Large Language Model (LMM) for all software
engineering tasks is resource-intensive and overlooks the potential benefits of
complementarity, where different models contribute unique strengths. However,
the degree to which coding LLMs complement each other and the best strategy for
maximizing an ensemble's potential are unclear, leaving practitioners without a
clear path to move beyond single-model systems.
  To address this gap, we empirically compare ten individual LLMs from five
families, and three ensembles of these LLMs across three software engineering
benchmarks covering code generation and program repair. We assess the
complementarity between models and the performance gap between the best
individual model and the ensembles. Next, we evaluate various selection
heuristics to identify correct solutions from an ensemble's candidate pool.
  We find that the theoretical upperbound for an ensemble's performance can be
83% above the best single model. Our results show that consensus-based
strategies for selecting solutions fall into a "popularity trap," amplifying
common but incorrect outputs. In contrast, a diversity-based strategy realizes
up to 95% of this theoretical potential, and proves effective even in small
two-model ensembles, enabling a cost-efficient way to enhance performance by
leveraging multiple LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为德国Heinrich Hertz卫星通信任务开发自动化地面段系统，实现周期性无人值守操作，提高操作效率并降低人力成本。

Method: 采用预计划和自动执行调度系统，实现无人工干预的指令发送；用户任务与主任务计划分离并自动协调；建立自动化监控系统，可触发配置化响应；提供自助服务用户门户。

Result: 成功应用于2023年7月发射的Heinrich Hertz卫星，实现了办公时间外的全自动化操作，支持用户灵活调度实验（最短1分钟响应时间），并提供实时实验监控。

Conclusion: 该自动化地面段概念成功验证了周期性无人值守卫星操作的可行性，为未来卫星任务提供了高效的自动化操作模式。

Abstract: We present our approach for a periodically unstaffed, fully automated ground
segment. The concept is in use for the first time on the German satellite
communications mission Heinrich Hertz on behalf of the German Space Agency at
DLR. Heinrich Hertz was launched in July 2023 and offers access to scientific
and technical experiments to its users. The mission utilizes major automation
concepts for the satellite platform operations, allowing fully automated
operations outside of office hours. The concept includes tracking, telemetry
and commanding (TTC) of the satellite. Pre-planned and automatically executed
schedules enable commanding without human interaction. The user mission
schedule is planned separately from the main mission schedule and is
automatically de-conflicted. The automatic monitoring concept monitors the
systems of the satellite and all assets in the ground segment and triggers
reactions in operator-configurable ways depending on the mission needs, for
example emergency notifications or automated execution of flight operation
procedures. Additionally, the concept also puts special emphasis on a
self-service user portal that provides flexible access 24/7, even when the
control center is not staffed. The portal allows external users of the payload
to schedule pre-defined experiments, monitor the live execution of the
experiment with browser-based displays and access ground station telemetry and
dedicated RF test equipment during the time of their scheduled experiment.
Tasks can be planned long in advance as well as with a short reaction time
(less than 1 minute), which allows, for example, the reconfiguration of the
payload during a running experiment.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了如何通过联合需求与系统规范来实现GDPR的隐私设计(PbD)，开发了一种基于GDPR法律概念建模的方法，支持法律知识捕获、规范透明度和可追溯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分考虑GDPR中问题空间与解决方案空间的复杂交叉，缺乏对实践者关于PbD规范目标和需求的深入理解。需要联合的需求和系统规范来确保隐私设计。

Method: 通过回顾二手研究和相关一手研究，与从业者进行访谈，调查实践状态和理解规范目标。开发并评估了针对PbD的需求和系统规范方法。

Result: GDPR中问题空间与解决方案空间的关系对支持PbD至关重要。基于GDPR法律概念建模的方法有助于捕获法律知识、支持规范透明度和可追溯性。

Conclusion: GDPR需求需要在工程生命周期的不同抽象层次上解决才能实现PbD。GDPR文本中的法律知识应被捕获在规范中，以满足不同利益相关者的需求并确保合规性。

Abstract: Context: Consistent requirements and system specifications are essential for
the compliance of software systems towards the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). Both artefacts need to be grounded in the original text and
conjointly assure the achievement of privacy by design (PbD). Objectives: There
is little understanding of the perspectives of practitioners on specification
objectives and goals to address PbD. Existing approaches do not account for the
complex intersection between problem and solution space expressed in GDPR. In
this study we explore the demand for conjoint requirements and system
specification for PbD and suggest an approach to address this demand. Methods:
We reviewed secondary and related primary studies and conducted interviews with
practitioners to (1) investigate the state-of-practice and (2) understand the
underlying specification objectives and goals (e.g., traceability). We
developed and evaluated an approach for requirements and systems specification
for PbD, and evaluated it against the specification objectives. Results: The
relationship between problem and solution space, as expressed in GDPR, is
instrumental in supporting PbD. We demonstrate how our approach, based on the
modeling GDPR content with original legal concepts, contributes to
specification objectives of capturing legal knowledge, supporting specification
transparency, and traceability. Conclusion: GDPR demands need to be addressed
throughout different levels of abstraction in the engineering lifecycle to
achieve PbD. Legal knowledge specified in the GDPR text should be captured in
specifications to address the demands of different stakeholders and ensure
compliance. While our results confirm the suitability of our approach to
address practical needs, we also revealed specific needs for the future
effective operationalization of the approach.

TL;DR: 提出Senses系统，通过多智能体强化学习在边缘IoT网络中实现节能，通过动态调整传感器覆盖、数据分区和平衡设备运行时长来减少冗余数据并延长网络寿命。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着IoT设备数量增长和传感器数据爆炸式增加，大量数据在计算和传输中消耗大量能量，且不合理的重复数据会导致"蝴蝶效应"，需要解决数据去重和节能问题。

Method: 采用多智能体强化学习(MARL)，在传感器层面动态调整覆盖范围实现数据去重，在控制器层面进行数据分区和冗余消除，在全局层面平衡异构设备的运行时长。

Result: 测试床实验和仿真结果显示，Senses在控制设备上节省11.37%的能耗，并将IoT设备网络的整体运行时长延长20%。

Conclusion: Senses系统通过多层次的节能策略有效解决了IoT网络中的能量消耗和数据冗余问题，显著提升了网络性能和寿命。

Abstract: As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices continuously grows and
application scenarios constantly enrich, the volume of sensor data experiences
an explosive increase. However, substantial data demands considerable energy
during computation and transmission. Redundant deployment or mobile assistance
is essential to cover the target area reliably with fault-prone sensors.
Consequently, the ``butterfly effect" may appear during the IoT operation,
since unreasonable data overlap could result in many duplicate data. To this
end, we propose Senses, a novel online energy saving solution for edge IoT
networks, with the insight of sensing and storing less at the network edge by
adopting Muti-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Senses achieves data
de-duplication by dynamically adjusting sensor coverage at the sensor level.
For exceptional cases where sensor coverage cannot be altered, Senses conducts
data partitioning and eliminates redundant data at the controller level.
Furthermore, at the global level, considering the heterogeneity of IoT devices,
Senses balances the operational duration among the devices to prolong the
overall operational duration of edge IoT networks. We evaluate the performance
of Senses through testbed experiments and simulations. The results show that
Senses saves 11.37% of energy consumption on control devices and prolongs 20%
overall operational duration of the IoT device network.

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够有效解决无线可充电传感器网络中的多目标优化问题，生成多样化的帕累托最优解，并适应动态操作条件。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in sensor networks, conventional battery-powered
sensor networks suffer from limited operational lifespans and frequent
maintenance requirements that severely constrain their deployment in remote and
inaccessible environments. As such, wireless rechargeable sensor networks
(WRSNs) with mobile charging capabilities offer a promising solution to extend
network lifetime. However, WRSNs face critical challenges from the inherent
trade-off between maximizing the node survival rates and maximizing charging
energy efficiency under dynamic operational conditions. In this paper, we
investigate a typical scenario where mobile chargers move and charge the
sensor, thereby maintaining the network connectivity while minimizing the
energy waste. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem
that simultaneously maximizes the network node survival rate and mobile charger
energy usage efficiency across multiple time slots, which presents NP-hard
computational complexity with long-term temporal dependencies that make
traditional optimization approaches ineffective. To address these challenges,
we propose an enhanced evolutionary multi-objective deep reinforcement learning
algorithm, which integrates a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based policy
network for temporal pattern recognition, a multilayer perceptron-based
prospective increment model for future state prediction, and a time-varying
Pareto policy evaluation method for dynamic preference adaptation. Extensive
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly
outperforms existing approaches in balancing node survival rate and energy
efficiency while generating diverse Pareto-optimal solutions. Moreover, the
LSTM-enhanced policy network converges 25% faster than conventional networks,
with the time-varying evaluation method effectively adapting to dynamic
conditions.

Motivation: 学校环境中的ASD诊断系统依赖物联网摄像头，但纯云端处理存在隐私和延迟问题，而纯边缘推理精度有限。

Method: 采用分层框架，边缘执行主要推理，仅上传低置信度样本到云端；云端生成温度缩放软标签，通过跨学校聚合的全局损失蒸馏回边缘模型。

Result: 在两个公共ASD面部图像数据集上达到87.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架在保护隐私的同时提高了诊断精度，具有在实际应用中可扩展部署的潜力。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis systems in school environments
increasingly relies on IoT-enabled cameras, yet pure cloud processing raises
privacy and latency concerns while pure edge inference suffers from limited
accuracy. We propose Confidence-Constrained Cloud-Edge Knowledge Distillation
(C3EKD), a hierarchical framework that performs most inference at the edge and
selectively uploads only low-confidence samples to the cloud. The cloud
produces temperature-scaled soft labels and distils them back to edge models
via a global loss aggregated across participating schools, improving
generalization without centralizing raw data. On two public ASD facial-image
datasets, the proposed framework achieves a superior accuracy of 87.4\%,
demonstrating its potential for scalable deployment in real-world applications.

TL;DR: TURBOTEST是一个系统化的网速测试终止框架，通过将吞吐量预测与测试终止决策分离，使用机器学习方法在保证准确性的前提下显著减少测试数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网速测试平台采用静态洪泛设计，单次测试可能传输数百MB数据，每月产生PB级流量，造成巨大成本负担。需要在不牺牲准确性的前提下实现早期终止。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段训练回归器从部分测量数据预测最终吞吐量；第二阶段训练分类器决定何时积累足够证据可以停止测试。利用传输层特征（RTT、重传、拥塞窗口等）和吞吐量数据。

Result: 在17.3万次M-Lab NDT网速测试上评估，TURBOTEST比基于BBR信号的方法节省2-4倍数据量，同时降低中位误差。

Conclusion: 基于机器学习的自适应终止方法能够提供准确、高效且可部署的大规模网速测试解决方案。

Abstract: Internet speed tests are indispensable for users, ISPs, and policymakers, but
their static flooding-based design imposes growing costs: a single high-speed
test can transfer hundreds of megabytes, and collectively, platforms like
Ookla, M-Lab, and Fast.com generate petabytes of traffic each month. Reducing
this burden requires deciding when a test can be stopped early without
sacrificing accuracy. We frame this as an optimal stopping problem and show
that existing heuristics-static thresholds, BBR pipe-full signals, or
throughput stability rules from Fast.com and FastBTS-capture only a narrow
portion of the achievable accuracy-savings trade-off. This paper introduces
TURBOTEST, a systematic framework for speed test termination that sits atop
existing platforms. The key idea is to decouple throughput prediction (Stage 1)
from test termination (Stage 2): Stage 1 trains a regressor to estimate final
throughput from partial measurements, while Stage 2 trains a classifier to
decide when sufficient evidence has accumulated to stop. Leveraging richer
transport-level features (RTT, retransmissions, congestion window) alongside
throughput, TURBOTEST exposes a single tunable parameter for accuracy tolerance
and includes a fallback mechanism for high-variability cases. Evaluation on
173,000 M-Lab NDT speed tests (2024-2025) shows that TURBOTEST achieves nearly
2-4x higher data savings than an approach based on BBR signals while reducing
median error. These results demonstrate that adaptive ML-based termination can
deliver accurate, efficient, and deployable speed tests at scale.

TL;DR: 提出了Quality of Coverage (QoC)这一新型多维关键性能指标集，用于更精细地表征蜂窝网络覆盖质量，超越了当前仅关注最小带宽的简化表示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蜂窝网络覆盖表示过于简化，仅关注最小可用带宽，未能纳入网络在时空维度上的稳定性这一关键可用性因素。由于无线传播特性和网络负载与容量之间的关系，蜂窝覆盖质量具有复杂性，需要更精细的表征。

Method: 定义了一套QoC关键性能指标(KPIs)，反映了实际测量的性能质量、可用性和稳定性。使用三个不同的数据集来分析这些KPI表征网络行为的能力。

Result: QoC能够提供比当前指标更精细和有用的蜂窝网络覆盖表示，能够更全面地捕捉时空维度的可用性和弹性。

Conclusion: QoC指标集能够更有效地表征蜂窝网络的实际覆盖质量，为网络性能评估提供了更全面的框架。

Abstract: Current representations of cellular coverage are overly simplistic; they
state only the minimal level of available bandwidth (i.e., 35/3Mbps
download/upload speed for 5G) and fail to incorporate a critical component of
usability: network stability over space and time. Cellular coverage quality is
complex given wireless propagation characteristics and relationships between
network load and (often limited) network capacity. A more fine-grained
characterization is essential. We introduce Quality of Coverage (QoC), a novel
multi-dimensional set of key performance indicators (KPIs) that reflect actual
measured performance quality, usability and stability. This representation of
the coverage of the cellular network more fully captures temporal and spatial
usability and resilience. We motivate and define a set of QoC KPIs and use
three distinct datasets to analyze the ability of the KPIs to characterize
network behavior, demonstrating the ability of QoC to offer a more fine-grained
and useful representation of cellular coverage than possible with current
metrics.

Conclusion: 源编码组播为需要高吞吐量和自适应群组通信的下一代网络提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multicast remains a fundamental mechanism for scalable content distribution,
yet existing approaches face critical limitations. Traditional multicast trees
suffer from path redundancy and inefficient utilization of network resources,
while network coding, although capacity-achieving, incurs significant
computational overhead and deployment challenges. In this paper, we introduce a
source-coded multicast framework that exploits maximum-flow decomposition to
construct multiple disjoint or partially overlapping paths from the source to
all receivers. Our scheme incorporates a novel path redirection mechanism: when
multiple overlaps occur between receiver flows, downstream paths are realigned
at the first intersection, ensuring loop-free delivery while maximizing overall
throughput. We develop algorithms for path construction, overlap detection, and
iterative refinement of multicast subgraphs, and analyze their computational
complexity. Through extensive evaluation on synthetic and real network
topologies, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently approaches the
throughput of network coding with substantially lower encoding and decoding
complexity, while significantly outperforming multicast tree constructions in
terms of fairness, robustness to link failures, and delivery efficiency. These
results position source-coded multicast as a practical and scalable solution
for next-generation networks requiring high-throughput and adaptive group
communication.

TL;DR: CESAR通过在线强化学习框架解决音频大语言模型中的推理逆缩放问题，将推理过程从性能负担转变为性能增益，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型中的推理过程常常导致性能下降（测试时逆缩放现象），这并非推理本身的问题，而是缺乏适当训练指导导致的幻觉和不一致推理。

Method: 采用在线强化学习框架CESAR，使用Group Relative Policy优化和多方面奖励机制，激励正确性、格式、一致性、结构化分析模式、因果推理、领域知识整合和校准推理深度。

Result: 解决了测试时逆缩放问题，在MMAU Test-mini上超越Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-4o Audio，在MMSU推理任务上接近人类水平，同时提升了多模态推理和感知能力。

Conclusion: CESAR为开发稳健可扩展的音频大语言模型推理提供了原则性方法，证明通过适当训练指导可以显著提升推理质量。

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

Motivation: 现有基于图的时空学习方法依赖预定义图拓扑（如相关性阈值、行业分类），无法适应不同危机机制（信用传染、疫情冲击、通胀驱动抛售）下的市场动态变化。

Method: 使用图卷积网络编码空间关系，BiLSTM与自注意力机制编码时间动态，通过多头图注意力网络学习稀疏结构，过滤92.5%的连接作为噪声，保留危机相关依赖关系。

Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing
assumptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多目标贝叶斯优化问题仍然具有挑战性，需要生成多样化的帕累托最优解

Result: 在各种合成和真实基准函数上始终优于最先进算法

Conclusion: MOBO-OSD能有效生成多样化的帕累托最优解，在超体积性能和解多样性方面表现优异

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了"学习不成为"（负学习）的新范式来解决多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题，通过主导模态动态引导弱模态抑制非目标类别，而非强制对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态学习方法强制弱模态与主导模态对齐（正学习），这会抑制弱模态的独特信息。需要一种新方法来平衡模态间的关系。

Method: 提出多模态负学习（MNL）框架，使用动态引导机制让主导模态指导弱模态抑制非目标类别，而非增强目标类预测。

Result: 理论证明该方法能提高多模态学习的鲁棒性下界，增加单模态置信度边界，在噪声和不平衡场景下显著减少弱模态的实证误差。

Conclusion: 负学习范式能有效解决模态不平衡问题，保持弱模态的独特信息，在多基准测试中表现出优越性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

Method: 1. 使用与区间目标兼容的损失函数，基于假设类的平滑性建立非渐近泛化界；2. 提出min-max学习框架：在提供的区间内最小化最坏情况（最大化）的目标标签，并通过平滑性约束解决非凸性问题。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，所提出的方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为区间目标回归问题提供了有效的解决方案，通过兼容的损失函数和min-max框架处理了目标不确定性，并在实验中验证了方法的优越性。

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

Conclusion: 该工作建立了元学习在蛋白质突变分析中的系统性应用，并引入了有效的突变编码策略，为蛋白质工程中的跨域泛化提供了变革性方法。

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

Motivation: 移动设备计算资源有限，但其统一内存架构和CPU-GPU性能差距缩小为协同执行提供了机会，主要挑战在于同步开销和执行时间预测困难。

Method: 使用基于OpenCL细粒度共享虚拟内存的轻量级同步机制，以及机器学习模型来准确预测CPU和GPU任务的执行时间，特别是考虑了GPU内核的性能特征和调度时间。

Result: 在四个移动平台上，线性层实现了最高1.89倍加速（接近理论最大值2.01倍），卷积层实现了最高1.75倍加速（接近理论最大值1.87倍）。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够快速选择CPU-GPU协同执行策略，在移动设备上显著减少深度学习推理延迟，接近理论最优性能。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important
but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

Motivation: 现实世界预测需要整合结构化时间序列数据和非结构化文本信息，但现有方法在架构上受到固定输入输出范围的限制，且无法建模或量化不确定性。

Method: LBS包含两个组件：(1)状态空间模型骨干捕捉潜在状态的时间动态；(2)预训练的大型语言模型编码文本输入进行后验状态估计，并解码与潜在轨迹一致的文本预测。

Conclusion: 这是首个将LLM和SSM统一用于联合数值和文本预测的工作，为多模态时间推理提供了新颖的基础。

Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series
data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are
architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model
or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing
LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic
framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of
two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the
temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual
observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that
is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode
textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables
flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification,
and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias
of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus
benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20%
while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the
first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction,
offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

Motivation: 无模型强化学习缺乏形式化安全保证，现有方法通常需要详细的安全规范知识，而许多难以明确规范的安全问题可以通过不变性来表征。

Method: 使用模型预测路径积分控制检查学习策略提出的动作安全性，只需能够查询黑盒动态，无需显式动态模型或安全约束知识。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在所有不安全动作发生前成功中止，同时训练进度与允许违反安全性的基线PPO方法相当。

Conclusion: 基于可逆性的方法能够有效防止安全问题，同时保持训练效率，为强化学习提供了实用的安全保证机制。

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual
learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments
characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based
forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized
clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including
Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source
framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing
continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

Conclusion: 协作式多智能体辩论协议能够有效缓解辩论黑客问题，通过非零和博弈框架提升错误检测性能，为大语言模型的可扩展监督提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏统一的测试库，重新实现各种RNN架构耗时且容易出错，限制了研究的可重复性和探索性。

Method: 开发了Julia和Python语言的开源库，集中实现了多种循环单元和高级循环架构，提供一致的框架来构建和扩展RNN模型。

Result: 创建了三个活跃维护的开源库，提供内置的自定义和实验机制，所有包均采用MIT许可证并在GitHub上维护。

Conclusion: 这些库为RNN研究提供了统一的测试平台，促进了模型的可重复性和进一步探索。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a cornerstone of sequence modeling
across various scientific and industrial applications. Owing to their
versatility, numerous RNN variants have been proposed over the past decade,
aiming to improve the modeling of long-term dependencies and to address
challenges such as vanishing and exploding gradients. However, no central
library is available to test these variations, and reimplementing diverse
architectures can be time-consuming and error-prone, limiting reproducibility
and exploration. Here, we introduce three open-source libraries in Julia and
Python that centralize numerous recurrent cell implementations and higher-level
recurrent architectures. torchrecurrent, RecurrentLayers.jl, and
LuxRecurrentLayers.jl offer a consistent framework for constructing and
extending RNN models, providing built-in mechanisms for customization and
experimentation. All packages are available under the MIT license and actively
maintained on GitHub.

*Yanzhi Chen,Zijing Ou,Adrian Weller,Michael U. Gutmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于向量copula理论的互信息估计方法，在复杂模型和简化模型之间实现平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有互信息估计方法要么依赖需要大量数据的复杂模型（如神经网络），要么使用过于简化的模型（如高斯copula）而无法捕捉复杂分布

Method: 基于向量copula理论，在复杂模型和简化模型之间进行原则性插值，实现复杂度和容量的更好权衡

Result: 在先进合成基准测试和具有多种模态的真实世界数据上的实验证明了所提出估计器的优势

Conclusion: 该方法在互信息估计任务中实现了复杂度和容量之间的更好平衡

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a
principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better
trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art
synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed estimator.

*Jubilee Lee,Daniele E. Schiavazzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文评估了隐式神经表示（INRs）在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示中的性能，发现INRs能实现高达约230的压缩比，且误差控制在临床可接受范围内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示作为一种强大的知识表示框架，具有分辨率独立性和高内存效率，但它们在特定领域应用中的准确性尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 研究了多种缓解频谱偏差的策略，包括专用激活函数、固定和可训练的位置编码，以及非线性核的线性组合。

Result: 在胸主动脉的血流动力学场中，INRs实现了约230的压缩比，压力最大绝对误差为1 mmHg，速度为5-10 cm/s；在48个胸主动脉解剖结构中，平均和最大绝对解剖差异分别低于0.5 mm和1.6 mm。

Conclusion: SIREN、MFN-Gabor和MHE架构表现出最佳性能，INRs在心血管领域具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L2M3OF是首个用于金属有机框架(MOF)的多模态大语言模型，通过整合晶体结构表示学习和语言理解，在材料特性预测和知识生成任务中超越了仅基于文本的闭源LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但在科学发现领域突破有限，因为理解复杂物理现象需要超越语言的多元表示。MOF设计尤其依赖难以用文本编码的人类专业知识，因此需要多模态方法。

Method: L2M3OF结合预训练的晶体编码器和轻量级投影层，将结构信息压缩到token空间，实现与语言指令的高效对齐。模型处理结构、文本和知识三种模态，并基于精心策划的结构-属性-知识数据库进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，L2M3OF在特性预测和知识生成任务中超越了GPT-5、Gemini-2.5-Pro和DeepSeek-R1等最先进的闭源LLM，且使用的参数数量更少。

Conclusion: 多模态方法对于多孔材料理解至关重要，L2M3OF为下一代材料发现AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

TL;DR: MeDyate是一个理论支持的内存受限动态子网络适应框架，通过改进的层重要性度量和动态通道采样策略，在极端内存约束下实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备端神经网络训练面临严重的内存限制，阻碍了预训练模型在下游任务上的适应。需要开发能在严格内存预算下有效进行微调的方法。

Method: 提出LaRa（层排序）改进的层重要性度量用于原则性层预选，以及利用通道重要性分布时间稳定性的动态通道采样策略，在训练周期间根据重要性加权概率重新采样通道。

Result: 在大量任务和架构上的广泛评估表明，MeDyate在极端内存约束下实现了最先进的性能，始终优于现有的静态和动态方法，同时保持高计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法代表了向高效设备端学习迈出的重要一步，展示了在仅需几百kB RAM的内存预算下进行有效微调的能力。

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic
subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer
Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer
pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the
temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space
exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across
a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves
state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently
outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high
computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards
enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning
with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理需要大量计算资源和内存，标准均匀量化在低比特场景下会导致显著性能下降，需要更有效的量化方法。

Method: 使用分组格向量量化，为每组权重分配可学习生成矩阵定义的格码本，采用Babai舍入近似最近格点搜索来训练生成矩阵，解码时简化为矩阵向量乘法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，相比现有后训练量化基线，该方法在模型大小和精度之间实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: GLVQ框架在严格资源约束下部署大模型具有有效性，提供了高效实用的量化流程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

Motivation: 尽管大多数现代机器学习参数化是非凸的，但拉格朗日对偶已成为解决约束学习问题的流行工具。然而，增强拉格朗日方法在约束学习环境中相对未被充分探索，该方法旨在减轻非凸设置中的对偶间隙，同时只需最小修改。

Conclusion: 增强拉格朗日方法在约束学习问题中具有显著优势，能够有效处理非凸优化问题，同时保证收敛性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations,
Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained
learning problems. We revisit Augmented Lagrangian methods, which aim to
mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal
modifications, and have remained comparably unexplored in constrained learning
settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove
convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions,
and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架在多个应用领域都表现出色，实现了高性能、低功耗的时间序列分类，具有很好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

TL;DR: DD2提出了一种新的条件分数蒸馏方法，使图像自回归模型能够实现一步采样，显著提升生成速度，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像自回归模型生成速度慢，需要大量采样步骤。虽然DD1实现了少步采样，但在一步采样时性能下降严重，且依赖预定义映射限制了灵活性。

Method: 将原始AR模型视为教师模型，在潜在嵌入空间中提供条件分数真值。提出条件分数蒸馏损失来训练一步生成器，通过单独网络预测生成分布的条件分数，并在每个token位置进行分数蒸馏。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上，DD2将一步采样的FID从3.40增加到5.43，相比最强基线DD1将一步采样与原始AR模型的差距减少了67%，同时实现了最高12.3倍的训练加速。

Conclusion: DD2在实现一步自回归生成方面迈出了重要一步，为快速高质量的AR建模开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of
visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from
slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required.
Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

Conclusion: ZO-FC为设备端持续学习提供了实用且内存高效的解决方案，成功平衡了稳定性和可塑性之间的权衡。

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Conclusion: 学习率选择与算法设计同等重要，对实现统计和计算效率至关重要。提出的分层训练算法提供了一种超越传统相关性查询的新方法。

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic
representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label
scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and
configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support
reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出物理一致性神经算子(PCNO)和扩散模型增强的PCNO(DiffPCNO)，通过物理约束投影层确保预测满足物理定律，并利用一致性模型量化不确定性，实现高精度、物理一致且不确定性感知的时空预测。

Result: PCNO和DiffPCNO在从湍流建模到真实世界洪水/大气预测等多种系统和空间分辨率下，实现了高保真度的时空预测，同时保持了物理一致性和不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 该两阶段框架为准确、物理基础扎实且不确定性感知的时空预测提供了一个稳健且通用的方法。

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

Motivation: 当前非侵入式脑机接口基准主要针对简单的基础任务，而实际应用如脑到文本转换仍然难以实现。关键词检测作为实用且保护隐私的中间任务可以填补这一空白。

Method: 使用52小时的LibriBrain语料库，采用针对极端类别不平衡的评估协议，使用AUPRC和每小时误报率作为评估指标。提出了紧凑的1-D Conv/ResNet基线模型，结合焦点损失和top-k池化。

Conclusion: 关键词检测是脑机接口的可行中间任务，具有实际应用潜力。模型性能可扩展，且受词级因素影响，为未来研究提供了基准和工具支持。

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

Motivation: 解决传统多目标优化方法在在线设置下效率低、难以灵活整合用户偏好、需要显式计算超体积等问题。

Conclusion: A-GPS是一个简单而强大的方法，能够生成高质量的帕累托集近似，灵活捕捉用户偏好，避免显式超体积计算。

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar
Probe (PSP) solar wind data using distributed processing and the
quantum-inspired Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method. The PSP dataset
(2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our
framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to
estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters,
including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well
as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in
the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from
the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed
and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and
mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms;
our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach
offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring
complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale
in situ measurements. Processed data products and analysis tools are made

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

Motivation: 理解深度网络成功背后的神经崩溃现象，特别是要超越先前将最后一层特征视为无约束优化变量的假设，研究数据结构和非线性激活对NC的影响。

Method: 分析在正交可分数据上训练的两层ReLU网络的梯度流动态，研究其优化过程如何导致神经崩溃现象的出现。

Result: 证明了梯度流在这种网络架构下确实会表现出神经崩溃现象，显示了数据结构和非线性激活在NC形成中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 神经崩溃现象不仅出现在无约束特征优化的全局最小值中，也出现在具有数据结构和非线性激活的实际网络训练动态中，训练过程中的隐式偏置是促进NC出现的重要因素。

Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional
discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the
intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures
emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the
theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization
landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DictPFL是一个实用的联邦学习框架，通过分解模型权重为静态字典和可更新查找表，仅加密传输部分梯度，在保证完全隐私的同时大幅降低了同态加密的计算和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于同态加密的联邦学习方法存在两极化问题：要么加密所有梯度导致高昂开销，要么部分加密梯度存在隐私泄露风险。需要一种既能提供完全梯度保护又具有实用性的解决方案。

Method: 提出DictPFL框架，包含两个关键模块：DePE将模型权重分解为静态字典和可更新查找表，仅加密传输后者；PrME通过加密感知剪枝和历史引导掩码最小化加密参数数量。

Result: 相比完全加密的联邦学习，DictPFL将通信成本降低402-748倍，训练速度提升28-65倍；相比最先进的选择性加密方法，开销降低51-155倍，速度提升4-19倍。运行时间仅比明文联邦学习慢2倍以内。

Conclusion: DictPFL首次证明基于同态加密的私有联邦学习在实际部署中是可行的，在保证完全隐私的同时实现了接近明文训练的性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据，但在药物发现和材料科学中往往缺乏足够的标记样本。现有的少样本分子属性预测方法虽然通过上下文图引入关系归纳偏置，但分子-属性图的结构指导有限。

Method: 构建全局三元异质图（基序-分子-属性），引入化学有意义的基序节点捕获长程组合模式；在局部层面为每个分子-属性对构建子图并分别编码，使模型关注最相关的邻近分子和基序。

Result: 在五个标准FSMPP基准测试中，该方法始终优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 将全局基序知识与细粒度局部上下文相结合，能够有效推进鲁棒的少样本分子属性预测。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and
materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large
labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property
prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational
inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property
nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We
propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for
few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information
at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful
motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional
groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph,
yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range
compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with
common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the
molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's
attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments
on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the
effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local
context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

TL;DR: ESCORT是一个基于粒子的框架，用于在高维信念空间中捕捉复杂的多模态分布，通过相关感知投影和时间一致性约束来改进SVGD方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准POMDP信念近似方法无法准确表示复杂的不确定性结构（如高维多模态信念分布），导致估计错误和次优的智能体行为。

Method: 扩展SVGD，引入相关感知投影来建模状态维度间的依赖关系，以及时间一致性约束来稳定更新同时保持相关结构。

Result: 在POMDP领域和合成多模态分布上的广泛评估显示，ESCORT在信念近似精度和下游决策质量方面始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: ESCORT能够动态适应信念景观复杂性，无需重采样或限制性分布假设，为复杂POMDP环境提供了有效的信念表示解决方案。

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

Result: 在合成数据集和真实世界数据上的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用的特征选择框架，能够在多个子群体间平衡模型性能，适用于特征收集成本高昂的应用场景。

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统线性-二次模型无法处理非线性效用、随机动态或高维动作等现实环境的问题，为合同设计提供通用计算工具。

Method: 采用现代机器学习技术进行双层优化，通过Hessian-向量乘积使用隐式微分和共轭梯度法计算超梯度。

Conclusion: 该框架为合同设计提供了新的计算工具，使系统研究分析上难以处理的模型成为可能。

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePULSe是一种新的训练方法，通过在标准强化学习损失基础上增加额外损失，使用学习到的建议来引导采样低奖励输出并降低其概率，从而在期望奖励和不良输出概率之间实现更好的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准强化学习方法优化平均奖励，而专注于减少不良输出概率的方法通常会牺牲平均性能。为了改善这种权衡，需要一种新方法。

Method: RePULSe在标准RL损失基础上增加额外损失，使用学习到的建议来引导采样低奖励输出，然后降低这些输出的概率。

Result: 实验表明，与标准RL对齐方法和替代方案相比，RePULSe在期望奖励与不良输出概率之间实现了更好的权衡，并且具有更强的对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RePULSe通过引导采样低奖励输出并降低其概率，有效改善了语言模型对齐中期望奖励与安全性的权衡关系。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习需要模型在不断适应新任务的同时不忘记过去的知识，现有方法在基础模型的持续学习中存在效率低下和干扰问题。

Method: 扩展了低秩适应(LoRA)，引入任务特定的正交基向量，采用基于扰动的优化策略来最小化冲突，并包含新颖的选择机制来识别干扰敏感度最小的基向量。

Result: 在标准持续学习基准测试中，PLAN始终优于现有方法，为基础模型的持续学习建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: PLAN框架通过主动管理任务特定子空间分配，有效解决了持续学习中的干扰问题，为基础模型的持续学习提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks
without forgetting past knowledge. In this work, we propose
\underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N}
(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenReview是迄今为止最大的包含LLM生成评审意见的数据集，包含81K条为2018-2025年ICLR会议提交论文生成的评审，使用负面、正面和中性三种提示词生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在科学同行评审中的使用日益增多，需要全面数据集来理解其效用和影响，此前缺乏这样的数据集。

Method: 构建GenReview数据集，为ICLR 2018-2025所有提交论文使用三种独立提示词（负面、正面、中性）生成LLM评审意见，并与原始论文和评审关联。

Result: 研究发现：LLMs在评审中存在偏见；LLM生成的评审目前可以自动检测；LLMs不能总是严格遵循评审指南；LLM提供的评分仅与接受论文的决定一致。

Conclusion: GenReview数据集填补了相关研究空白，支持对LLMs在科学评审中应用的广泛研究，揭示了LLMs在评审中的局限性和潜在问题。

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

### [89] [Online AUC Optimization Based on Second-order Surrogate Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21202)
*JunRu Luo,Difei Cheng,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于成对铰链损失的二阶代理损失函数，用于优化AUC性能，解决了传统方法在非凸性和内存成本方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AUC是分类任务中重要的性能指标，特别是在类别不平衡场景下。但优化AUC面临两个主要挑战：成对0/1损失的非凸性和不连续性导致优化困难，以及实例级存储的高内存成本在大规模应用中造成瓶颈。

Method: 提出了一种新的二阶代理损失方法，基于成对铰链损失构建。该方法不近似单个成对损失项，而是用训练数据的一阶和二阶统计量直接替代整个聚合的成对损失。还开发了高效的在线算法，并扩展到非线性设置。

Result: 理论分析表明，传统在线AUC优化算法通常达到O(√T)遗憾界，而该方法获得了更紧的O(ln T)遗憾界。在多个基准数据集上的实验证明了所提二阶代理损失在优化在线AUC性能方面的优越效率和效果。

Conclusion: 提出的二阶代理损失方法有效解决了AUC优化的关键挑战，在理论和实验上都表现出优于传统方法的性能，特别是在大规模在线学习场景中。

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online
AUC performance.

Motivation: 现有基于上下文学习的表格基础模型虽然能在未见真实数据的情况下泛化良好，但合成先验分布的设计原则仍不明确，需要系统研究来填补这一空白。

Method: 系统研究合成先验的关键属性，提出Mitra模型，通过精心选择的多样化、独特且性能优异的合成先验混合进行训练。

Conclusion: 合成先验分布的设计对表格基础模型的泛化性能至关重要，Mitra证明了精心设计的先验混合能够显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

Motivation: 现有的图神经网络面临适应性挑战，固定的消息传递架构难以处理现实世界中图结构的多样性。虽然混合专家方法提供了适应性路径，但现有方法依赖监督信号且训练不稳定。

Method: 采用骨干-残差专家架构，基础编码器提供稳定性，专用残差专家捕捉多样化计算模式。使用结构感知门控网络进行细粒度节点路由，通过统一的无监督目标进行端到端训练，结合重构任务和信息论多样性正则化。

Conclusion: ADaMoRE通过无监督训练异构混合专家，显著提升了图神经网络在多样化图结构和任务上的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于流匹配的生成模型中间生成步骤缺乏可解释性的问题，这些模型通过一系列向量场更新将噪声转换为数据，但每个步骤的含义不透明。

Method: 提出通用框架，约束每个流步骤从已知物理分布中采样，将流轨迹映射到模拟物理过程的平衡状态。具体实现包括编码器、流匹配网络和投影器，通过2D Ising模型将流步骤转化为参数化冷却调度中的热平衡点。

Result: 在多个晶格尺寸上验证了该框架，显示其在保持物理保真度的同时，随着晶格尺寸增大，生成速度优于蒙特卡洛方法。与标准流匹配相比，每个向量场代表了2D Ising模型潜在空间中有意义的逐步转变。

Conclusion: 将物理语义嵌入生成流可以将不透明的神经轨迹转化为可解释的物理过程，证明了物理约束在提高生成模型可解释性方面的价值。

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

Conclusion: FDA框架为模型合并提供了新的视角，连接了联合多任务训练和后验合并，兼具鲁棒性和灵活性。

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

Conclusion: 通过对抗训练成功构建了神经网络世界模型中的最混淆实例，发现模型不确定性是影响混淆程度的关键因素，这为深度模型强化学习的理论发展提供了新见解。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics

We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We

methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability
properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.

Conclusion: Wideformer通过并行聚合和消息优先级机制成功解决了图注意力中的过聚合问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

Conclusion: Buffer层方法有效解决了归一化层更新的根本局限性，在真实世界域适应场景中展现出有效性和通用性。

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实世界传感器噪声对人类活动识别的挑战，通过训练与测试噪声模式匹配的模型来提高鲁棒性。

Method: 使用PatchTST变换器架构，为每个惯性传感器位置训练独立模型，采用1秒滑动窗口和随机抖动、缩放、旋转、通道丢失等数据增强技术。

Result: 在Kaggle测试集上，通过四个传感器模型的softmax概率平均，在私有排行榜上取得了显著高于基线的macro-F1分数。

Conclusion: 测试匹配的数据增强与基于变换器的集成策略是在噪声条件下实现鲁棒人类活动识别的有效方法。

Abstract: We present a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach for robust human
activity recognition on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge. Our method leverages
the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per
inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding
windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and
test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized
jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to
generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute
softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and
average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline
achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that
test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an
effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了DVC方法，一种预算感知的数据选择框架，用于多层感知机训练，通过分层评估数据贡献来解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法（如核心集构建、数据Shapley值和影响函数）存在关键限制：过度简化非线性变换、忽略隐藏层中间表示、或由于高计算复杂度无法扩展到大型MLP。

Method: DVC方法将数据贡献分解为层价值贡献(LVC)和全局价值贡献(GVC)，使用6个精心设计的指标和高效算法，从质量、相关性和分布多样性三个维度捕获数据特征，并结合UCB算法进行自适应源选择。

Conclusion: 这是神经网络分层数据评估的首个系统处理方法，为大规模机器学习系统提供了理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

TL;DR: 本文分析了广义可加模型(GAMs)解释生成的计算复杂性，发现在不同输入空间结构、组件模型类型、回归与分类任务以及不同解释方法下，GAMs的解释复杂性呈现出多样化的正负结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GAMs通常被认为是可解释的机器学习模型，但本文质疑了高效生成GAMs有意义的解释这一假设，旨在系统分析其计算复杂性。

Method: 通过计算复杂性理论分析，在P!=NP等标准假设下，研究不同形式的GAMs在各种上下文中的解释生成复杂性。

Result: 发现：(1)GAMs解释复杂性受输入空间结构影响；(2)组件模型类型差异只在特定输入域下显现；(3)回归与分类任务的解释复杂性存在显著差异；(4)将复杂模型表示为可加形式(如神经可加模型)仅对某些解释方法和输入域有益。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了计算GAMs多样解释的可行性条件，为理解此类计算何时可行或证明困难提供了严格的理论框架。

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

TL;DR: EPHAD是一个测试时自适应框架，用于在训练数据被污染的情况下更新异常检测模型的输出，通过整合先验知识和多模态基础模型证据来提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的无监督异常检测方法通常假设训练数据是干净的，但实际数据集往往包含未被检测到或错误标记的异常，导致性能显著下降。现有解决方案需要访问训练管道、数据或事先知道数据中异常的比例，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出EPHAD框架，在测试时更新在污染数据集上训练的异常检测模型的输出，整合先验知识和来自多模态基础模型（如CLIP）、经典异常检测方法或领域特定知识的证据。

Result: 在8个视觉异常检测数据集、26个表格异常检测数据集和1个真实工业异常检测数据集上进行了全面实验验证，并通过消融研究分析了超参数影响和对不同污染水平的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EPHAD在不同异常检测模型和证据对中展现出多功能性和鲁棒性，为解决训练数据污染问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将深度学习的表达能力与概率建模的严谨性相结合，为部分标签学习提供了一种高效且架构无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

Result: 发现相邻数据集在类间分布重叠更大时表现出更低的多重性，这与传统预期相反。提出了多重性感知的数据获取策略和插补技术。

Conclusion: 数据分布特征对模型多重性有重要影响，类间重叠增加反而降低多重性。提出的多重性感知方法在主动学习和数据插补中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

Motivation: 传统随机多臂老虎机中的遗憾度量无法解决奖励分配的公平性问题，特别是在需要公平分配奖励的场景中，如临床试验中的患者分配。

Method: 采用初始均匀探索阶段后接标准上置信界(UCB)算法，仅依赖加性Hoeffding界，可自然扩展到次高斯奖励分布。

Result: 该算法实现了近乎最优的Nash遗憾，并推广到p均值遗憾类公平指标，在所有p值上获得(近乎)最优遗憾界。

Conclusion: 相比现有需要强假设和专门算法设计的方法，本文提出的简单方法在更弱假设下实现了更好的性能，为公平性老虎机问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速扩展，低精度训练对于减少内存、提高效率至关重要，但现有理论假设所有组件都是精确的，忽略了硬件感知量化，无法解释低精度训练为何有效。

Method: 引入理论框架分析Adam和Muon等自适应优化器在梯度、权重和优化器状态浮点量化下的收敛性，在平滑非凸目标上推导收敛速率，明确量化不同组件的量化误差影响。

Result: 两种算法在尾数长度仅随迭代次数对数增长时，保持接近全精度对应算法的收敛速率。Adam对权重和第二矩量化高度敏感，而Muon需要更弱的误差控制，因此可能更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该研究缩小了低精度训练方法的实证成功与理论理解之间的差距，数值实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

TL;DR: SANI是一种语言模型遗忘方法，通过重置最后层神经元和避免记忆敏感信息的微调来消除模型对敏感数据的记忆，显著减少信息泄露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型在特定任务微调时会记忆敏感数据（如医疗报告、商业数据），导致隐私泄露风险，需要在不进行昂贵重新训练的情况下消除这些记忆。

Method: SANI采用两阶段方法：1）擦除阶段重置模型最后层神经元以破坏细粒度信息记忆；2）修复阶段微调模型同时避免记忆敏感信息。

Result: 仅需少量遗忘轮次即可有效净化模型，显著减少敏感信息泄露次数，适用于医疗等行业已训练模型的共享前净化。

Conclusion: SANI提供了一种高效的语言模型遗忘方法，能够在不进行昂贵重新训练的情况下消除敏感数据记忆，降低隐私泄露风险。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

Conclusion: ScoreNF为复杂物理系统建模提供了一种高效采样方法，减少了对计算昂贵的MCMC生成训练数据的依赖

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

Conclusion: RAVEN能够有效解决弱到强泛化在分布偏移下的问题，自动分配更高权重给更准确的弱模型，实现鲁棒的弱监督学习

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models
to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the
most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as

*Sina Molavipour,Alireza M. Javid,Cassie Ye,Björn Löfdahl,Mikhail Nechaev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于神经网络的稳健收益率曲线估计框架，针对小型抵押债券市场的稀疏和噪声数据问题，通过新损失函数确保平滑性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如自举法和Nelson-Siegel模型在债券稀疏、价格波动或噪声较大时存在过拟合或不稳定性问题，需要更稳健的收益率曲线估计方法。

Method: 使用神经网络框架，为每个交易日独立估计收益率曲线，引入新损失函数来强制平滑性和稳定性，并可集成领域特定约束如无风险基准对齐。

Result: 在瑞典抵押债券上的实证结果显示，该方法比Nelson-Siegel-Svensson和Kernel-Ridge方法提供更稳健和稳定的收益率曲线估计。

Conclusion: 该神经网络框架能够有效处理小型债券市场的有限和噪声数据问题，允许从业者根据需求在平滑性和准确性之间进行权衡。

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

*Jaesik Yoon,Hyeonseo Cho,Sungjin Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-MCTD通过引入全局感知的规划器、分布式探索器和预规划缓存，将MCTD从单轨迹优化提升到完整规划组合的推理，解决了MCTD在训练轨迹长度和局部搜索上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTD虽然结合了扩散模型和树搜索进行轨迹探索，但受限于训练轨迹长度，且规划过程局限于局部轨迹搜索，缺乏全局上下文。

Method: 提出了C-MCTD框架，包含三个组件：在线组合器进行全局感知规划，分布式组合器通过并行探索降低搜索复杂度，预规划组合器利用缓存图加速推理。

Result: C-MCTD将规划从单轨迹优化提升到完整规划组合的推理，实现了更高效的全局规划。

Conclusion: C-MCTD通过组合式规划方法有效解决了MCTD的局限性，为长序列规划问题提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

Motivation: 研究发现文本到图像扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）经常复制和放大社会偏见，特别是在性别和种族等人口统计属性上。

Method: 使用公平主成分分析将CLIP输入嵌入投影到最小化群体特定信息同时保留语义内容的子空间，并通过经验噪声注入和统一跨人口统计投影方法增强去偏效果。

Result: 在性别、种族和交叉设置上的广泛实验表明，FairImagen显著提高了公平性，在图像质量和提示保真度方面有适度权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架优于现有的后处理方法，为公平的文本到图像生成提供了简单、可扩展且模型无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机神经网络和前向正则化的在线任务无关类增量学习框架，通过集成深度随机向量函数链接网络和贝叶斯自适应调参，有效解决非独立同分布数据流下的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类增量学习在实际应用中的两个关键问题：(1) 非独立同分布的在线任务无关场景；(2) 长任务流中的记忆损失问题，旨在实现高效决策并减少累积遗憾。

Method: 提出随机神经网络与前向正则化框架，开发了edRVFL-kF算法实现单次闭式增量更新和可变学习率，并通过贝叶斯学习自适应确定正则化强度，避免重放和灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在2个图像数据集上的6个指标测试显示，该方法在动态性能、消融测试和兼容性方面均表现出色，验证了-kF-Bayes和-kF框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的OTCIL框架通过前向正则化和贝叶斯自适应机制，能够有效抵抗遗忘、提升学习性能，在在线任务无关类增量学习中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

Motivation: 解决用户在预期性能改进不理想时希望提前停止超参数优化过程的问题，平衡计算成本与模型性能之间的权衡。

Method: 在冻结-解冻框架中引入效用函数，结合新的采集函数和停止准则，动态选择最有潜力的配置继续训练，并通过迁移学习提高样本效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在成本与性能之间实现了更好的权衡，显著提升了超参数优化的效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/db-Lee/CFBO.

TL;DR: 该研究通过用户实验发现，在睡眠医学中，透明AI辅助（特别是作为质量控制步骤）比黑盒AI辅助能显著提高30%的事件级性能，同时减少评分者间差异，虽然耗时增加但用户接受度更高。


<details>

Motivation: AI系统在生物医学信号解读中已达到或超过人类专家水平，但临床实践中需要解决何时以及为何信任AI推荐的问题，以实现有效的临床整合。

Method: 对8名专业睡眠医学从业者进行应用基础用户研究，在三种条件下评分多导睡眠图数据：手动评分、黑盒AI辅助、透明白盒AI辅助，辅助时机包括开始评分时或作为事后质量控制。

Result: AI和人类-AI团队在临床标准评估中均显著优于未辅助专家，协作减少了评分者间差异。透明AI辅助作为质量控制步骤比黑盒辅助提高约30%事件级性能，质量控制时机进一步改善计数结果。

Conclusion: 策略性定时的透明AI辅助能有效平衡准确性和临床效率，为临床工作流程中可信AI整合和用户接受提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦的模块化归纳偏置，通过因子特定的重组规则来学习解耦表示，无需修改目标函数或架构即可同时解耦属性和对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解耦表示学习方法依赖特定于因子的策略，当新变化因子不符合先验假设或多个因子共存时，需要重新设计架构或目标，导致显著开销。

Method: 使用因子特定的混合策略随机重组潜在变量，通过先验损失和组合一致性损失强制编码器发现因子结构，混合策略的调整即可实现不同因子的解耦。

Result: 在属性和对象解耦任务中表现出竞争性性能，并独特地实现了全局风格和对象的联合解耦。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种通用框架，通过简单的混合策略调整即可灵活处理不同类型的解耦任务，无需修改目标或架构。

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

Method: 基于LLMs的上下文学习，改编认知神经科学关联学习范式，在六个模型中分析表征演化，并控制词汇干扰因素。

Result: 发现非单调变化模式，适度相似项目在学习后分化；词汇干扰增强分化，表明表征变化受项目相似性和全局竞争影响。

Conclusion: LLMs不仅是研究类人学习系统表征动态的强大工具，也是生成关于大脑记忆重组原理新假设的可访问计算模型。

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

<details>

Motivation: 传统基于扩散的方法需要预训练模型来学习反向噪声过程，而self-diffusion旨在开发一种自包含的迭代过程，不依赖预训练模型或外部去噪器。

Method: 提出自扩散框架，交替进行加噪和去噪步骤。在每个步骤中，对当前估计添加噪声，然后使用随机初始化的单卷积网络作为自去噪器，通过数据保真度损失进行训练来从噪声估计中预测解。

Result: 在线性逆问题上，self-diffusion实现了与其他方法相当或更优的性能，展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: Self-diffusion通过利用神经网络的频谱偏置和调度噪声过程，提供了一种灵活且广泛适用的逆问题求解方法，无需依赖预训练模型。

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于物理信息的极限学习机（PIELM）框架，用于解决逆Stefan问题，相比传统PINNs方法，在预测精度上提高了3-7个数量级，同时节省了94%以上的训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在解决Stefan问题时存在超参数依赖性强、训练效率低和预测精度不足的问题，需要开发更高效的物理信息学习方法。

Method: 使用极限学习机网络替代传统的深度神经网络，固定输入权重，通过优化由初始条件、边界条件和控制偏微分方程组成的物理定律损失向量来确定输出权重，将逆Stefan问题转化为寻找Moore-Penrose广义逆的最小二乘问题。

Result: 案例研究表明，与传统PINNs相比，PIELM在相对L2误差方面提高了3-7个数量级的预测精度，同时节省了超过94%的训练时间。

Conclusion: PIELM框架为逆Stefan问题提供了一种快速、准确的物理信息学习方法，显著提升了计算效率和预测精度。

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

Conclusion: GSAC通过因果表示学习和元学习相结合，有效解决了大规模网络系统中的可扩展性和领域泛化问题，具有理论保证和实际性能优势。

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出统一令牌表示(UTR)，将回报目标、状态和动作合并为单个令牌，显著减少序列长度和模型复杂度，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer方法如决策变换器存在令牌冗余和二次注意力复杂度问题，限制了在实时或资源受限环境中的可扩展性。

Method: 开发UTR表示方法，将回报目标、状态和动作合并为单一令牌，并基于此构建UDT(Transformer骨干)和UDC(门控CNN骨干)两个变体。

Result: 两种变体在性能上与最先进方法相当或更优，同时计算量显著降低。理论分析显示UTR具有更紧的Rademacher复杂度边界，表明更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UTR方法能很好地跨架构泛化，可能为未来大规模决策模型提供高效基础。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

Motivation: 传统RNN的序列性质限制了并行计算能力，而现有的并行架构如Transformer和状态空间模型(SSM)虽然能并行化，但SSM的线性约束限制了其表达能力，无法建模复杂的非线性序列依赖关系。

Method: 将非线性递归关系序列转化为单一方程组系统，使用牛顿迭代结合自定义并行归约方法进行并行求解，实现非线性RNN的并行训练。

Result: 实现了高达665倍的加速比，成功训练了70亿参数的LSTM和GRU模型，在困惑度指标上与同等规模的Transformer和Mamba2架构表现相当。

Conclusion: ParaRNN打破了非线性RNN的序列并行化障碍，为高效序列建模研究提供了新方向，开源代码框架将促进非线性RNN模型的大规模探索。

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling,
but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating
a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of
parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space
Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured
linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and
precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address
this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization
barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of
nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we
solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel
reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive
sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented
scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU
architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain
perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.
To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN
codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of
nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高推荐系统的可解释性对用户和公司都至关重要，用户上传的照片可以强化或证明他们对物品的看法，因此预测用户会拍摄的照片可以作为最有效的推荐解释。

Method: 提出一个形式化框架来估计给定用户-照片对的所有权概率，使用TripAdvisor数据（包含餐厅评论和照片）进行实证研究。

Result: 通过预测用户会为物品拍摄的照片，推荐系统可以解释其推荐结果并提高可靠性，同时公司可以了解客户关注的产品特征。

Conclusion: 将个性化解释作为推荐本身学习是提高推荐系统可解释性的有效方法，用户照片提供了直观的解释依据，有助于增强系统可信度和企业洞察力。

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

TL;DR: 提出HINet方法，结合图神经网络和领域对抗训练，在网络设置中估计异质处理效应，解决未知暴露映射和网络级协变量偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果机器学习方法通常假设已知暴露映射，这在现实中往往不切实际；同时同质性倾向与处理分配机制的交互会导致网络级协变量偏移，影响处理效应估计准确性。

Method: HINet方法整合图神经网络与领域对抗训练，能够在未知暴露映射情况下估计处理效应，并减轻网络级协变量偏移的影响。

Result: 在合成和半合成网络数据集上的广泛实证评估证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HINet方法能够有效解决网络设置中异质处理效应估计的挑战，特别是在未知暴露映射和协变量偏移的情况下。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超图神经网络（HNNs）虽然能有效编码高阶结构，但由于复杂的黑盒架构容易过拟合且存在可扩展性问题，特别是在少样本节点分类任务中。

Method: 基于线性化HNNs的统一公式，ZEN引入了权重矩阵的可处理闭式解和冗余感知传播方案，无需迭代训练并消除冗余自信息。

Result: 在11个真实世界超图基准测试中，ZEN在分类准确率上持续优于8个基线模型，同时比最快的竞争对手实现了高达696倍的加速。

Conclusion: ZEN不仅实现了表达能力和效率的平衡，其决策过程完全可解释，为数据集特征提供了洞察。

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up
to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of
ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a
dataset. Our code and datasets are fully available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了Vapnik和Chervonenkis的均匀收敛框架，引入了均匀均值可估计性(UME-learnability)概念，研究分布集合在任意估计器下是否允许均匀均值估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工作主要关注经验均值估计器的均匀收敛，本文旨在超越这一限制，研究更一般的均匀均值估计问题，即使用任意估计器时分布集合的均匀估计能力。

Method: 在分布集合的均值向量空间上工作，分析均值向量的可分离性条件，并构造非可分但UME可学习的分布集合反例。

Result: 证明均值向量的可分离性是UME可学习的充分条件但不是必要条件，并证明了UME可学习集合的可数并集也是UME可学习的。

Conclusion: 建立了均匀均值可估计性的理论基础，解决了Cohen等人(2025)提出的猜想，为分布集合的均匀估计提供了更一般的框架。

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

Motivation: 生成流网络通常从噪声数据中近似估计奖励函数，导致学习策略存在认知不确定性，需要量化这种不确定性。

Method: 构建多项式混沌展开的代理模型，在小规模训练流网络集合上拟合，学习奖励函数参数与流网络轨迹中各步骤动作概率分布的关系。

Result: 在离散和连续网格世界、符号回归以及贝叶斯结构学习任务上验证了方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够通过廉价蒙特卡洛采样有效估计在不确定奖励下策略的不确定性。

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian
structure learning task.

TL;DR: 提出统一模型(UM)用于无人机灾后道路评估路由，同时处理8种问题变体，相比单任务方法减少8倍训练时间和参数，在解决方案质量上优于传统方法24-82%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统优化方法扩展性差、现有深度强化学习方法需要为每个问题变体训练单独模型、缺乏适应性的问题，为动态灾害场景提供灵活部署方案。

Method: 使用现代transformer编码器-解码器架构，通过单一神经网络在多个问题配置上训练，捕捉共享结构知识；采用轻量级适配器机制实现高效微调。

Result: 在1000节点网络内实现实时解决方案(1-10秒)，解决方案质量比单任务DRL方法高6-14%，比传统优化方法高24-82%；微调实验显示能以最小成本有效整合未见属性。

Conclusion: UM为时间关键型应用推进了神经组合优化，提供了计算高效、高质量且适应性强的无人机灾后道路评估解决方案。

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

TL;DR: 本文研究使用探针检测模型内部行为时面临的Goodhart定律问题，并提出两种基于监督微调和直接偏好优化的训练方法，发现在偏好优化中探针可检测性保持得更好，且探针重训练比探针集成更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探针可用于检测模型内部的不良行为（如欺骗或偏见），但当探针成为训练目标时，其可靠性可能下降（Goodhart定律）。本文旨在探索如何在训练中使用探针的同时保持其检测准确性。

Method: 提出两种基于监督微调和直接偏好优化的训练方法，在毒性减少测试平台上进行实验，评估训练后探针准确性的下降程度，并尝试使用探针集成、保留未训练探针和训练后重训练探针三种策略来保持探针准确性。

Result: 基于探针的偏好优化比基于分类器的方法更好地保持了探针可检测性；探针多样性带来的实际益处有限，训练后重训练探针即可恢复高检测准确率。

Conclusion: 基于探针的训练在某些对齐方法中是可行的，当重训练可行时，探针集成大多是不必要的。

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为时空区域扭曲(SRD)的伪异常生成方法，通过在正常视频中应用严重增强来创建合成异常，结合噪声伪标签显著减少标签噪声，从而有效进行对抗训练，显著提升了弱监督视频异常检测模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督视频异常检测模型容易受到对抗攻击，但由于弱监督的限制（只有视频级标签），传统对抗防御机制如对抗训练效果不佳。伪标签虽然能实现帧级对抗训练，但噪声严重影响性能。

Method: 提出时空区域扭曲(SRD)方法，在正常视频的局部区域应用严重增强来创建合成异常，同时保持时间一致性。将这些精确标注的合成异常与噪声伪标签结合，显著减少标签噪声。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法在整体AUROC性能上平均比最先进方法高出71.0%，显著增强了WSVAD模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SRD方法通过生成精确标注的合成异常与噪声伪标签相结合，有效减少了标签噪声，使对抗训练在弱监督视频异常检测中变得可行，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

TL;DR: 提出了修订相似性问题，引入切除评分(ES)作为新的静态度量方法，通过移除共享内容来专注于差异区域，在代码编辑评估中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相似性度量方法(如BLEU)在评估文档修订时存在问题，因为它们的得分被共享内容主导，无法准确反映人类对修订差异的判断。

Method: 提出切除评分(ES)，使用最长公共子序列(LCS)移除现有文档与修订版本之间的共享内容，然后比较剩余的差异区域，并通过近似方法将标准立方LCS计算加速到二次。

Result: 在HumanEvalFix上的实验显示，ES比最接近的竞争对手SARI提高了12%的皮尔逊相关性，比标准度量如BLEU提高了>21%。当增加共享上下文时，ES的改进进一步增加到20%和>30%。

Conclusion: ES是一个有效的修订相似性度量方法，能够正确处理共享内容不变性、代码块移动、匹配插入或删除等复杂情况，与人类判断更好地对齐。

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

Conclusion: MADDPG-COCG算法能有效解决SAGIN-MEC系统中的复杂优化问题，提升用户中心性能，为低空经济应用提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to
generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee
correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

Conclusion: REVE支持标准化EEG研究，加速临床神经科学进展，并发布了代码、预训练权重和教程。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出HOPSS算法，通过同源扰动方法在解空间中直接生成训练数据集，显著减少时间步数，降低数据生成的计算和时间开销，同时保持模型训练所需的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动深度学习方法需要大量解对数据，这些数据通常通过传统数值方法生成，需要数千个时间步迭代，远多于训练所需的几十个，造成沉重的计算和时间开销。

Method: 首先从可靠求解器获取基础解函数，通过降采样对齐时间步；然后提出"同源扰动"方法：将两个解函数（一个作为主函数，另一个作为同源扰动项）与随机噪声结合，高效生成精度相当的PDE数据点；最后用这些数据点计算原方程右端项的变化形成新的解对。

Result: 理论和实验结果表明HOPSS降低了时间复杂度。例如在Navier-Stokes方程上，生成10,000个样本仅需传统方法约10%的时间，且模型训练性能相当。

Conclusion: HOPSS算法能够显著加速PDE训练数据集的生成，同时保持足够的精度，为数据驱动的深度学习模型提供了更高效的数据准备方案。

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了计算张量网络(TNs)SHAP解释的通用框架，证明了在张量链(TT)结构下SHAP计算可在多对数时间内并行完成，并将此结果推广到决策树、线性模型等多种ML模型，同时揭示了在二值化神经网络中宽度而非深度是SHAP计算的主要计算瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然SHAP对简单模型如决策树可在多项式时间内计算，但对神经网络等更复杂的黑盒模型计算变得NP难，而这类模型又最需要解释。本文旨在解决更广泛的张量网络模型的SHAP计算问题。

Method: 提出了计算任意结构张量网络SHAP解释的通用框架，特别关注张量链结构下的高效计算，并将结果推广到多种ML模型，同时分析二值化神经网络到张量网络的归约。

Result: 证明了在张量链结构下SHAP计算可在多对数时间内并行完成，并将此复杂度结果推广到决策树、树集成、线性模型和线性RNNs等模型，同时发现二值化神经网络中固定宽度时SHAP计算可高效处理，而固定深度时仍计算困难。

Conclusion: 张量网络为SHAP计算提供了高效的框架，特别是在张量链结构下可实现并行多对数时间计算。研究揭示了在神经网络解释中，宽度而非深度是主要的计算瓶颈，这对模型设计和解释方法选择具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial
time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

Motivation: 当前几何生成模型在推理时计算成本高昂，需要多步复杂数值模拟，因为它们基于黎曼流形上的扩散和流匹配等动态测度传输框架。

Method: 提出了广义流映射（GFM）框架，包含三种自蒸馏训练方法：广义拉格朗日流映射、广义欧拉流映射和广义渐进流映射。

Conclusion: GFM统一并提升了现有的欧几里得少步生成模型到黎曼设置，为几何生成建模提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为生成相关流形（GCM）的计算高效方法，通过Cholesky分解目标相关矩阵生成合成数据，数学上保证保留源数据集的完整相关结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前合成数据生成方法通常只能复制简单的汇总统计量，但无法保留定义现实世界系统中复杂多变量交互的成对和高阶相关结构，导致合成数据在复杂建模任务中失效。

Method: 使用Cholesky分解目标相关矩阵来生成合成数据，该方法数学上保证保留源数据集的完整相关结构，包括从简单成对关系到高阶交互的所有相关结构。

Result: 该方法能够生成保留完整相关结构的合成数据，计算效率高，为合成数据生成提供了新方法。

Conclusion: GCM方法在隐私保护数据共享、鲁棒模型训练和仿真等领域具有潜在应用价值，为合成数据生成提供了新途径。

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务感知蒸馏方法通常需要大量数据，但在许多实际场景中这些数据可能不可得或获取成本高昂。

Method: CoD策略通过系统性地注入反事实解释来进行蒸馏。反事实解释是指能够以最小扰动翻转教师模型输出预测的输入。

Result: 在各种数据集和LLM上的实验表明，CoD在小样本场景（低至8-512个样本）中优于标准蒸馏方法。CoD仅使用基线方法一半的原始样本及其对应的反事实解释，仍能提高性能。

Conclusion: CoD方法通过利用反事实解释有效提升了小样本任务感知知识蒸馏的效果，提供了从统计和几何角度对反事实解释在蒸馏中作用的理论保证。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

TL;DR: DEEDEE是一个用于强化学习时间序列的OOD检测器，使用简单的均值统计量和RBF核相似度来捕捉全局和局部偏差，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键环境中部署强化学习受到分布偏移脆弱性的限制，需要开发有效的OOD检测方法。

Method: DEEDEE使用两个统计量：情节均值和一个与训练摘要的RBF核相似度，分别捕捉全局和局部偏差，形成轻量级检测管道。

Result: DEEDEE在标准RL OOD测试套件中匹配或超越现有检测器，计算量减少600倍，准确率平均提高5%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，多样异常类型通常通过少量低阶统计量在RL轨迹中留下印记，为复杂环境中的OOD检测提供了紧凑基础。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

*Maximilien Dreveton,Elaine Siyu Liu,Matthias Grossglauser,Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文建立了在流行度调整块模型(PABM)下图聚类的理论极限，解决了现有模型的局限性。PABM引入了簇内和簇间连接的独立流行度参数，证明了即使传统边密度信号消失，只要簇内和簇间流行度系数不同，聚类恢复仍然可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有图聚类模型（如SBM和DCBM）的局限性，这些模型假设顶点度均匀或应用统一的度校正，无法捕捉局部连接模式的差异。PABM旨在更好地建模现实世界图中观察到的复杂度异质性。

Method: 提出PABM模型，为簇内和簇间连接引入独立的流行度参数。理论分析了PABM下聚类的最优错误率，并通过数值实验验证了使用k^2个特征向量的谱聚类算法优于传统方法。

Result: 证明了在PABM中，即使传统边密度信号消失，只要簇内和簇间流行度系数不同，聚类恢复仍然可能。数值实验证实，使用k^2个特征向量的谱聚类算法在合成和真实数据集上优于传统谱方法。

Conclusion: PABM捕捉了被DCBM忽略的度异质性维度：局部连接模式的差异可以独立于全局边密度增强簇可分性。由于PABM的期望邻接矩阵秩在k到k^2之间，传统使用前k个特征向量的谱嵌入可能无法捕获重要结构信息。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

Motivation: 在数据稀疏场景下，等变网络能改善建模效果，不确定性估计能防止过度自信，但等变性与模型置信度、模型校准之间的关系尚未被研究。

Method: 通过证明不同等变条件下不确定性校准误差(ECE和ENCE)的上下界，建立等变性与不确定性估计的理论框架，并用真实和模拟数据集进行数值实验验证。

Result: 理论分析阐明了等变模型的泛化极限，实验揭示了对称性不匹配、群大小以及偶然性和认知性不确定性对校准的影响趋势。

Conclusion: 等变性与模型校准存在密切关系，对称性不匹配会导致模型校准错误，该研究为理解等变网络在不确定性估计方面的表现提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

Motivation: 现有的等变学习方法通常需要群特定的归纳偏置，限制了方法的通用性。本文旨在开发一种无需群特定知识、仅从群作用观测中学习等变表示的方法。

Method: 提出Equivariance by Contrast (EbC)方法，通过对比学习联合学习潜在空间和群表示，使群作用对应可逆线性映射。在dSprites数据集上验证，群结构为(R_m × ℤ_n × ℤ_n)，包含离散旋转和周期平移。

Result: 学习到的嵌入表现出高保真等变性，群操作在潜在空间中忠实再现。在合成数据上成功验证了非阿贝尔正交群O(n)和一般线性群GL(n)，并提供了可识别性理论证明。

Conclusion: 这是首个仅从群作用观测中成功学习通用编码器等变表示的方法，包括非平凡非阿贝尔群和乘积群，为计算机视觉中仿射等变建模提供了新途径。

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.

Motivation: 局部收敛已成为分析稀疏随机图模型的基本工具，但需要新的收敛概念来完全刻画消息传递图神经网络在极限情况下的行为。

Method: 引入颜色收敛概念，基于Weisfeiler-Leman算法；提出精化配置模型(RCM)，推广了配置模型。

Result: RCM在局部树状随机图模型(包括Erdős-Rényi、随机块模型和配置模型)中具有局部收敛的普遍性；能够完全刻画此类图局部极限产生的随机树。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析随机图模型的局部收敛性质提供了完整工具，特别适用于消息传递图神经网络的理论分析。

Abstract: Local convergence has emerged as a fundamental tool for analyzing sparse
random graph models. We introduce a new notion of local convergence, color
convergence, based on the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm. Color convergence fully
characterizes the class of random graphs that are well-behaved in the limit for
message-passing graph neural networks. Building on this, we propose the Refined
Configuration Model (RCM), a random graph model that generalizes the
configuration model. The RCM is universal with respect to local convergence
among locally tree-like random graph models, including Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi,
stochastic block and configuration models. Finally, this framework enables a
complete characterization of the random trees that arise as local limits of
such graphs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在医疗、金融和网络安全等关键行业的应用日益广泛，确保AI驱动决策的透明性和正确性变得至关重要。传统的zkML系统需要深厚的密码学专业知识，限制了大多数ML工程师的使用。

Method: JSTprove提供了一个端到端的可验证AI推理管道，通过简单的命令行界面隐藏密码学复杂性，同时暴露可审计的工件以实现可重复性。

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) systems into critical industries
such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity has transformed decision-making
processes, but it also brings new challenges around trust, security, and
accountability. As AI systems become more ubiquitous, ensuring the transparency
and correctness of AI-driven decisions is crucial, especially when they have
direct consequences on privacy, security, or fairness. Verifiable AI, powered
by Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML), offers a robust solution to these
challenges. zkML enables the verification of AI model inferences without
exposing sensitive data, providing an essential layer of trust and privacy.
However, traditional zkML systems typically require deep cryptographic
expertise, placing them beyond the reach of most ML engineers. In this paper,
we introduce JSTprove, a specialized zkML toolkit, built on Polyhedra Network's
Expander backend, to enable AI developers and ML engineers to generate and
verify proofs of AI inference. JSTprove provides an end-to-end verifiable AI
inference pipeline that hides cryptographic complexity behind a simple
command-line interface while exposing auditable artifacts for reproducibility.
We present the design, innovations, and real-world use cases of JSTprove as
well as our blueprints and tooling to encourage community review and extension.
JSTprove therefore serves both as a usable zkML product for current engineering
needs and as a reproducible foundation for future research and production
deployments of verifiable AI.

Method: AgentBound结合了受Android权限模型启发的声明式策略机制和策略执行引擎，能够自动从源代码生成访问控制策略（准确率80.9%），并阻止恶意行为。

Result: 在包含296个最流行MCP服务器的数据集上测试显示，AgentBound能阻止多数恶意MCP服务器的安全威胁，且策略执行引擎引入的开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: AgentBound为开发者和项目经理提供了实用的MCP服务器安全基础，同时保持生产力，使研究人员和工具构建者能够探索声明式访问控制和MCP安全的新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into AI agents that interact with
external tools and environments to perform complex tasks. The Model Context
Protocol (MCP) has become the de facto standard for connecting agents with such
resources, but security has lagged behind: thousands of MCP servers execute
with unrestricted access to host systems, creating a broad attack surface. In
this paper, we introduce AgentBound, the first access control framework for MCP
servers. AgentBound combines a declarative policy mechanism, inspired by the
Android permission model, with a policy enforcement engine that contains
malicious behavior without requiring MCP server modifications. We build a
dataset containing the 296 most popular MCP servers, and show that access
control policies can be generated automatically from source code with 80.9%
accuracy. We also show that AgentBound blocks the majority of security threats
in several malicious MCP servers, and that policy enforcement engine introduces
negligible overhead. Our contributions provide developers and project managers
with a practical foundation for securing MCP servers while maintaining
productivity, enabling researchers and tool builders to explore new directions
for declarative access control and MCP security.

### [152] [LLM-Powered Detection of Price Manipulation in DeFi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21272)
*Lu Liu,Wuqi Zhang,Lili Wei,Hao Guan,Yongqiang Tian,Yepang Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PMDetector是一个结合静态分析和LLM推理的混合框架，用于主动检测DeFi智能合约中的价格操纵漏洞，在真实数据集上达到88%精确率和90%召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeFi智能合约管理数十亿美元资金，价格操纵漏洞（通常通过闪电贷）造成重大财务损失。现有检测方法有限：反应性方法只能在攻击发生后分析，而主动静态分析工具依赖僵化的预定义启发式规则，无法识别新型变体或理解复杂经济逻辑。

Method: 提出PMDetector混合框架，结合静态分析和LLM推理。采用三阶段流程：1) 静态污点分析识别潜在漏洞代码路径；2) 两阶段LLM处理：分析防御措施过滤路径，然后模拟攻击评估可利用性；3) 静态分析检查器验证LLM结果，保留高风险路径并生成详细漏洞报告。

Result: 在包含73个真实漏洞和288个良性DeFi协议的数据集上，PMDetector使用Gemini 2.5-flash达到88%精确率和90%召回率，显著优于最先进的静态分析和基于LLM的方法。使用GPT-4.1审计一个漏洞仅需0.03美元和4.0秒。

Conclusion: PMDetector提供了一种高效且经济可行的替代手动审计的方法，能够主动检测DeFi智能合约中的价格操纵漏洞，在检测精度和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts manage billions of dollars,
making them a prime target for exploits. Price manipulation vulnerabilities,
often via flash loans, are a devastating class of attacks causing significant
financial losses. Existing detection methods are limited. Reactive approaches
analyze attacks only after they occur, while proactive static analysis tools
rely on rigid, predefined heuristics, limiting adaptability. Both depend on
known attack patterns, failing to identify novel variants or comprehend complex
economic logic. We propose PMDetector, a hybrid framework combining static
analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-based reasoning to proactively detect
price manipulation vulnerabilities. Our approach uses a formal attack model and
a three-stage pipeline. First, static taint analysis identifies potentially
vulnerable code paths. Second, a two-stage LLM process filters paths by
analyzing defenses and then simulates attacks to evaluate exploitability.
Finally, a static analysis checker validates LLM results, retaining only
high-risk paths and generating comprehensive vulnerability reports. To evaluate
its effectiveness, we built a dataset of 73 real-world vulnerable and 288
benign DeFi protocols. Results show PMDetector achieves 88% precision and 90%
recall with Gemini 2.5-flash, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
static analysis and LLM-based approaches. Auditing a vulnerability with
PMDetector costs just $0.03 and takes 4.0 seconds with GPT-4.1, offering an
efficient and cost-effective alternative to manual audits.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FLAMES使用领域适配的大型语言模型自动生成Solidity智能合约的运行时防护，无需漏洞标签或形式化规范，能有效阻止真实攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约漏洞每年造成数十亿美元损失，现有自动化分析工具无法生成可部署的防御措施。

Method: 通过填充中间监督微调训练领域适配的LLM，从514,506个已验证合约中提取真实世界不变量。

Result: 编译成功率96.7%；在5000个挑战性不变量测试集上44.5%与真实值精确或语义匹配；阻止108个真实攻击中的22个(20.4%)；成功阻止APEMAGA真实事件攻击。

Conclusion: 领域适配的LLM能够自动生成生产就绪的智能合约安全防御，无需漏洞检测、形式化规范或人工干预。

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerabilities cost billions of dollars annually, yet
existing automated analysis tools fail to generate deployable defenses. We
present FLAMES, a novel automated approach that synthesizes executable runtime
guards as Solidity "require" statements to harden smart contracts against
exploits. Unlike prior work that relies on vulnerability labels, symbolic
analysis, or natural language specifications, FLAMES employs domain-adapted
large language models trained through fill-in-the-middle supervised fine-tuning
on real-world invariants extracted from 514,506 verified contracts. Our
extensive evaluation across three dimensions demonstrates FLAMES's
effectiveness: (1) Compilation: FLAMES achieves 96.7% compilability for
synthesized invariant (2) Semantic Quality: on a curated test set of 5,000
challenging invariants, FLAMES produces exact or semantically equivalent
matches to ground truth in 44.5% of cases; (3) Exploit Mitigation: FLAMES
prevents 22 out of 108 real exploits (20.4%) while preserving contract
functionality, and (4) FLAMES successfully blocks the real-world APEMAGA
incident by synthesizing a pre-condition that mitigates the attack. FLAMES
establishes that domain-adapted LLMs can automatically generate
production-ready security defenses for smart contracts without requiring
vulnerability detection, formal specifications, or human intervention. We
release our code, model weights, datasets, and evaluation infrastructure to
enable reproducible research in this critical domain.

### [154] [Can Current Detectors Catch Face-to-Voice Deepfake Attacks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21004)
*Nguyen Linh Bao Nguyen,Alsharif Abuadbba,Kristen Moore,Tingming Wu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了FOICE音频深度伪造检测，发现现有检测器在标准及噪声条件下均失效，提出了针对FOICE特定伪影的微调策略，显著提升了检测准确率，但揭示了在专门化与泛化能力之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FOICE技术能够仅凭单张面部图像生成逼真的合成语音，可绕过行业标准认证系统，由于面部图像比语音样本更易获取，这大大降低了大规模攻击的门槛，引发了严重的安全担忧。

Method: 研究两个核心问题：现有音频深度伪造检测器能否可靠检测FOICE生成的语音；对这些检测器进行FOICE数据微调是否能提高检测性能而不产生过拟合。采用了系统评估和针对性微调策略。

Result: 领先的检测器在标准和噪声条件下均持续失效；针对FOICE特定伪影的微调策略带来了显著的准确率提升；但微调后在专门化与对未见语音生成器的鲁棒性之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了当前防御系统的根本弱点，为下一代音频深度伪造检测的新架构和训练协议提供了动力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled the creation of
increasingly stealthy synthetic voices, commonly referred to as audio
deepfakes. A recent technique, FOICE [USENIX'24], demonstrates a particularly
alarming capability: generating a victim's voice from a single facial image,
without requiring any voice sample. By exploiting correlations between facial
and vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass
industry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and
Microsoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are
far easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering
the barrier to large-scale attacks. In this work, we investigate two core
research questions: (RQ1) can state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors
reliably detect FOICE-generated speech under clean and noisy conditions, and
(RQ2) whether fine-tuning these detectors on FOICE data improves detection
without overfitting, thereby preserving robustness to unseen voice generators
such as SpeechT5.
  Our study makes three contributions. First, we present the first systematic
evaluation of FOICE detection, showing that leading detectors consistently fail
under both standard and noisy conditions. Second, we introduce targeted
fine-tuning strategies that capture FOICE-specific artifacts, yielding
significant accuracy improvements. Third, we assess generalization after
fine-tuning, revealing trade-offs between specialization to FOICE and
robustness to unseen synthesis pipelines. These findings expose fundamental
weaknesses in today's defenses and motivate new architectures and training
protocols for next-generation audio deepfake detection.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出SIC（软指令控制）方法，通过迭代式提示净化循环来保护工具增强的LLM代理免受恶意提示注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在代理系统中处理不可信数据时容易受到提示注入攻击，需要有效的防护机制来确保系统安全。

Method: 采用迭代式提示净化循环，反复检查输入数据中的恶意指令，通过重写、掩码或删除来处理恶意内容，并重新评估结果，直到输入安全或达到最大迭代次数。

Result: SIC方法能有效提高防护门槛，但在最坏情况下，强对抗者仍能通过嵌入非命令式工作流程达到15%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: SIC提供了一种简单有效的提示净化方法，显著提高了LLM代理的安全性，虽然并非绝对可靠，但大大提升了攻击难度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic systems
that interact with an external environment; this makes them susceptible to
prompt injections when dealing with untrusted data. To overcome this
limitation, we propose SIC (Soft Instruction Control)-a simple yet effective
iterative prompt sanitization loop designed for tool-augmented LLM agents. Our
method repeatedly inspects incoming data for instructions that could compromise
agent behavior. If such content is found, the malicious content is rewritten,
masked, or removed, and the result is re-evaluated. The process continues until
the input is clean or a maximum iteration limit is reached; if imperative
instruction-like content remains, the agent halts to ensure security. By
allowing multiple passes, our approach acknowledges that individual rewrites
may fail but enables the system to catch and correct missed injections in later
steps. Although immediately useful, worst-case analysis shows that SIC is not
infallible; strong adversary can still get a 15% ASR by embedding
non-imperative workflows. This nonetheless raises the bar.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出SBASH框架，使用轻量级本地LLM解决蜜罐的数据保护问题，研究RAG和非RAG LLM在Linux shell命令中的表现，发现RAG能提高未调优模型的准确性，而通过系统提示调优的LLM无需RAG也能达到相似准确性且延迟更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蜜罐需要最大化攻击者参与度，上下文感知能力至关重要。LLM能提升上下文感知，但面临准确性、响应时间、运营成本高和云端部署的数据保护问题。

Method: 提出SBASH框架，使用轻量级本地LLM管理数据保护问题。研究RAG支持和非RAG的LLM在Linux shell命令中的应用，评估响应时间差异、人类测试者评估的真实性，以及使用Levenshtein距离、SBert和BertScore计算与真实系统的相似度。

Result: RAG能提高未调优模型的准确性，而通过系统提示调优的LLM无需RAG也能达到相似准确性，且延迟略低。

Conclusion: SBASH框架通过本地LLM有效解决数据保护问题，RAG和非RAG方法各有优势，系统提示调优的LLM在准确性和延迟方面表现良好。

Abstract: Honeypots are decoy systems used for gathering valuable threat intelligence
or diverting attackers away from production systems. Maximising attacker
engagement is essential to their utility. However research has highlighted that
context-awareness, such as the ability to respond to new attack types, systems
and attacker agents, is necessary to increase engagement. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer
from several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time,
high operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We
propose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which
manages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We
investigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and
non-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different
metrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and
similarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and
BertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models
that have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a
Linux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while
having a slightly lower latency.

TL;DR: 本文研究了布尔函数单边性（unate）的相对误差测试问题，提出了非自适应和自适应算法，并给出了相应的下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 布尔函数相对误差测试模型是近期研究热点，本文旨在解决任意布尔函数是否为单边函数的测试问题。

Method: 首先给出了需要知道满足赋值数N的非自适应单边算法，然后构建了不需要知道N的自适应单边算法，最后给出了自适应和非自适应双边算法的下界。

Result: 非自适应算法需要Õ(log(N)/ε)次采样和查询，自适应算法同样复杂度但不需要知道N。下界与非自适应算法复杂度基本匹配。

Conclusion: 本文为单边函数测试问题提供了高效的算法和匹配的下界，解决了相对误差测试模型中的一个重要问题。

Abstract: The model of relative-error property testing of Boolean functions has been
the subject of significant recent research effort [CDH+24][CPPS25a][CPPS25b] In
this paper we consider the problem of relative-error testing an unknown and
arbitrary $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ for the property of being a unate
function, i.e. a function that is either monotone non-increasing or monotone
non-decreasing in each of the $n$ input variables.
  Our first result is a one-sided non-adaptive algorithm for this problem that
makes $\tilde{O}(\log(N)/\epsilon)$ samples and queries, where $N=|f^{-1}(1)|$
is the number of satisfying assignments of the function that is being tested
and the value of $N$ is given as an input parameter to the algorithm.
  Building on this algorithm, we next give a one-sided adaptive algorithm for
this problem that does not need to be given the value of $N$ and with high
probability makes $\tilde{O}(\log(N)/\epsilon)$ samples and queries.
  We also give lower bounds for both adaptive and non-adaptive two-sided
algorithms that are given the value of $N$ up to a constant multiplicative
factor. In the non-adaptive case, our lower bounds essentially match the
complexity of the algorithm that we provide.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于脑机接口(BCI)的实时注意力监测系统，使用EEG头带检测学习者的注意力状态，通过实时反馈显著提高了学习专注度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习普及使得实时监测学生注意力变得重要，传统问卷方法需要人工干预，摄像头监控无法准确反映认知参与度，现有BCI方法缺乏实时验证。

Method: 使用FocusCalm EEG头带采集脑电信号，通过滑动窗口分割、带通滤波、伪影去除，提取时频域特征，采用SVM和递归特征消除进行注意力状态分类。

Result: 留一被试交叉验证准确率达88.77%，实时反馈实验显示反馈阶段注意力显著改善(t=5.73, p=0.007)。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效实时监测和改善学习者的注意力状态，为在线教育提供了可靠的注意力评估工具。

Abstract: Prevalence of online learning poses a vital challenge in real-time monitoring
of students' concentration. Traditional methods such as questionnaire
assessments require manual interventions and webcam-based monitoring fails to
provide accurate insights into learners' mental focus as they are deceived by
mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based
approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address
these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a
non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record
brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data
were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational
video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire
assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window),
filtered (butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high-amplitude and EOG
artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet and statistical
features have been extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE)
with Support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention
states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy has been
tested to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon non-attention
state detection and keeps focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to
evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants completed a
10-minute session consisting of a 5-minute baseline phase without feedback
followed by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were issued if
participants remained non-attentive for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A
paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant
improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.

TL;DR: 提出了Pairmixer作为AlphaFold3中Pairformer的替代方案，消除了计算昂贵的三角形注意力，同时保持了几何推理能力，显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaFold在蛋白质结构预测方面取得了突破，但在虚拟配体筛选、全蛋白质组折叠等大规模应用中，运行时间和内存成本过高。主要瓶颈在于Pairformer中的三角形注意力计算。

Method: 引入Pairmixer作为简化替代方案，消除三角形注意力但保留高阶几何推理能力，专注于成对推理的优化。

Result: Pairmixer显著提高了计算效率，在折叠和对接基准测试中达到最先进水平，长序列推理速度提升4倍，训练成本降低34%。在BoltzDesign中采样速度提升2倍以上，可处理比Pairformer内存限制长30%的序列。

Conclusion: Pairmixer的高效性减轻了下游应用的计算负担，使大规模蛋白质复合物建模、高通量配体和结合剂筛选等应用更加可行。

Abstract: AlphaFold has transformed protein structure prediction, but emerging
applications such as virtual ligand screening, proteome-wide folding, and de
novo binder design demand predictions at a massive scale, where runtime and
memory costs become prohibitive. A major bottleneck lies in the Pairformer
backbone of AlphaFold3-style models, which relies on computationally expensive
triangular primitives-especially triangle attention-for pairwise reasoning. We
introduce Pairmixer, a streamlined alternative that eliminates triangle
attention while preserving higher-order geometric reasoning capabilities that
are critical for structure prediction. Pairmixer substantially improves
computational efficiency, matching state-of-the-art structure predictors across
folding and docking benchmarks, delivering up to 4x faster inference on long
sequences while reducing training cost by 34%. Its efficiency alleviates the
computational burden of downstream applications such as modeling large protein
complexes, high-throughput ligand and binder screening, and hallucination-based
design. Within BoltzDesign, for example, Pairmixer delivers over 2x faster
sampling and scales to sequences ~30% longer than the memory limits of
Pairformer.

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一种表示优先、模块化的化学动力学模拟方法，将长期的理论承诺转化为实际可用的发现引擎。

Abstract: Estimating reaction rates and chemical stability is fundamental, yet
efficient methods for large-scale simulations remain out of reach despite
advances in modeling and exascale computing. Direct simulation is limited by
short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and
struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction
network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational
cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like
harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point
searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by
overhead and numerical instability.
  This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical
representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal
Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal
transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the
potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling.
Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce
reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the
final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are
specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first,
modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and
Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and
practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding
theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.

TL;DR: xMem是一个新颖的框架，通过仅使用CPU的动态分析来准确估计GPU峰值内存需求，无需消耗GPU资源或进行侵入式代码修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU资源稀缺，需要更智能的深度学习作业调度策略。准确估计GPU内存需求对于防止内存不足错误和提高资源利用率至关重要，但现有方法在捕捉运行时动态方面存在局限。

Method: 提出xMem框架，利用仅CPU的动态分析来先验估计GPU峰值内存需求，避免了GPU资源消耗和侵入式代码修改。

Result: 在25个不同模型（包括CNN和Transformer）的5209次运行评估中，xMem将中位数相对误差降低了91%，将安全OOM阈值的估计失败概率显著降低了75%，内存节省潜力比现有解决方案提高了368%。

Conclusion: xMem通过CPU-only动态分析有效解决了GPU内存需求估计的挑战，显著提高了估计精度和资源利用率，为共享集群环境中的深度学习作业调度提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: The global scarcity of GPUs necessitates more sophisticated strategies for
Deep Learning jobs in shared cluster environments. Accurate estimation of how
much GPU memory a job will require is fundamental to enabling advanced
scheduling and GPU sharing, which helps prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors and
resource underutilization. However, existing estimation methods have
limitations. Approaches relying on static analysis or historical data with
machine learning often fail to accurately capture runtime dynamics.
Furthermore, direct GPU analysis consumes scarce resources, and some techniques
require intrusive code modifications. Thus, the key challenge lies in precisely
estimating dynamic memory requirements, including memory allocator nuances,
without consuming GPU resources and non-intrusive code changes. To address this
challenge, we propose xMem, a novel framework that leverages CPU-only dynamic
analysis to accurately estimate peak GPU memory requirements a priori. We
conducted a thorough evaluation of xMem against state-of-the-art solutions
using workloads from 25 different models, including architectures like
Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformers. The analysis of 5209 runs,
which includes ANOVA and Monte Carlo results, highlights xMem's benefits: it
decreases the median relative error by 91% and significantly reduces the
probability of estimation failure as safe OOM thresholds by 75%, meaning that
the estimated value can often be used directly without causing OOM. Ultimately,
these improvements lead to a 368% increase in memory conservation potential
over current solutions.

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict
multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a
single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to
reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is
still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in
additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We
extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR
parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on
explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating
a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to
this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show
state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple
object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the
generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other
visual media.

Motivation: 传统随机共振技术基于单阈值检测器，局限于时间无关信号，需要大量噪声且会扭曲复杂信号特征。

Method: 提出双阈值检测系统，集成两个单阈值检测器，在原始数据域和多尺度域进行评估，使用小波变换进行多尺度分析。

Conclusion: 通过引入稳健的弱信号识别方法推进了基于随机共振的检测方法学，在各学科具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Stochastic resonance (SR), a phenomenon originally introduced in climate
modeling, enhances signal detection by leveraging optimal noise levels within
non-linear systems. Traditional SR techniques, mainly based on single-threshold
detectors, are limited to signals whose behavior does not depend on time. Often
large amounts of noise are needed to detect weak signals, which can distort
complex signal characteristics. To address these limitations, this study
explores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale
applications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be
analyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying
dynamics.
  We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two
single-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection. We evaluate it
both in the original data domain and in the multiscale domain using simulated
and real-world signals and compare its performance with existing methods.
  Experimental results demonstrate that, in the original data domain, the
proposed double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection
compared to conventional single-threshold approaches. Its performance is
further improved in the frequency domain, requiring lower noise levels while
outperforming existing detection systems. This study advances SR-based
detection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal
identification, with potential applications in various disciplines.

TL;DR: 本文通过数据中心的探索，研究了语音语言模型预训练中数据处理、合成数据构建和训练序列编排等关键因素，并基于这些发现训练了一个3.8B参数的SpeechLM模型，在性能上超越了更大规模的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音问答系统缺乏对预训练数据处理和筛选的受控消融研究，难以理解影响性能的关键因素，尽管在其他数据模态中类似研究已取得显著进展。

Method: 进行数据中心探索，重点关注三个研究问题：原始网络爬取音频内容的处理方式、合成预训练数据集的构建方法、以及(文本、音频)片段在训练序列中的编排策略。

Result: 基于研究发现训练了3.8B参数的SpeechLM模型SpeLangy，在性能上比大3倍的模型提升了10.2%的绝对性能。

Conclusion: 有效的数据筛选对语音语言预训练具有重要影响，希望这些发现能指导未来SpeechLMs的数据中心探索。

Abstract: Spoken Question-Answering (SQA) is a core capability for useful and
interactive artificial intelligence systems. Recently, several speech-language
models (SpeechLMs) have been released with a specific focus on improving their
SQA performance. However, a lack of controlled ablations of pretraining data
processing and curation makes it challenging to understand what factors account
for performance, despite substantial gains from similar studies in other data
modalities. In this work, we address this gap by conducting a data-centric
exploration for pretraining SpeechLMs. We focus on three research questions
fundamental to speech-language pretraining data: (1) how to process raw
web-crawled audio content for speech-text pretraining, (2) how to construct
synthetic pretraining datasets to augment web-crawled data and (3) how to
interleave (text, audio) segments into training sequences. We apply the
insights from our controlled data-centric ablations to pretrain a
3.8B-parameter SpeechLM, called SpeLangy, that outperforms models that are up
to 3x larger by 10.2% absolute performance. We hope our findings highlight the
impact of effective data curation for speech-language pretraining and guide
future data-centric exploration in SpeechLMs.

TL;DR: 提出边界建议网络(BPN)来改进鲸鱼声音检测系统，通过减少误报和提升少数类检测性能，在现有轻量级声音事件检测系统基础上实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲸鱼声音检测系统存在误报率高和少数类检测困难的问题，需要改进检测精度。

Method: 扩展现有轻量级声音事件检测系统，引入边界建议网络(BPN)，利用分类模型中的中间潜在表示来筛选最终输出，并采用前向搜索和后向搜索两种超参数优化方法。

Result: BPN使精度绝对提升16.8%，D-call和BP-call的F1分数分别提升21.3%和9.4%，完整系统F1分数达到0.475，比基线提升9.8%。

Conclusion: BPN能有效减少鲸鱼声音检测中的误报，提升少数类检测性能，结合超参数优化可获得显著性能改进。

Abstract: While recent sound event detection (SED) systems can identify baleen whale
calls in marine audio, challenges related to false positive and minority-class
detection persist. We propose the boundary proposal network (BPN), which
extends an existing lightweight SED system. The BPN is inspired by work in
image object detection and aims to reduce the number of false positive
detections. It achieves this by using intermediate latent representations
computed within the backbone classification model to gate the final output.
When added to an existing SED system, the BPN achieves a 16.8 % absolute
increase in precision, as well as 21.3 % and 9.4 % improvements in the F1-score
for minority-class d-calls and bp-calls, respectively. We further consider two
approaches to the selection of post-processing hyperparameters: a
forward-search and a backward-search. By separately optimising event-level and
frame-level hyperparameters, these two approaches lead to considerable
performance improvements over parameters selected using empirical methods. The
complete WhaleVAD-BPN system achieves a cross-validated development F1-score of
0.475, which is a 9.8 % absolute improvement over the baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA是一种基于视频的无监督自适应方法，通过多视角物体中心视频对视觉基础模型进行自监督微调，无需标注即可适应新领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉基础模型在分布偏移和标注稀缺的领域表现不佳，而现有的自监督学习方法对视觉编码器模型效果有限。

Method: 采用自蒸馏范式，结合多视角物体观测和参数高效适应技术，防止模型遗忘预训练知识。

Result: 在3个视觉基础模型和2个数据集上的实验表明，VESSA在下游分类任务中相比基线模型和先前方法有持续改进。

Conclusion: VESSA为视觉基础模型提供了一种有效的无监督领域自适应方案，能够利用多视角视频数据提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-SAE是一种稀疏自编码器，通过将视觉-语言表示编码为隐藏层激活来解释多模态对齐，其中每个神经元对应一个由语义相似的图像和文本表示的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于难以将多模态表示的语义映射到统一的概念集，视觉-语言对齐的可解释性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出VL-SAE稀疏自编码器，使用基于距离的编码器和两个模态特定解码器，通过余弦相似度显式对齐多模态表示，确保语义相似表示具有一致的神经元激活。

Result: 在多个VLM（如CLIP、LLaVA）上的实验表明，VL-SAE在解释和增强视觉-语言对齐方面具有优越能力，能够提高零样本图像分类和消除幻觉等下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: VL-SAE通过概念级别的对齐增强了视觉-语言表示的对齐，为多模态对齐提供了可解释性，并在下游任务中带来了性能提升。

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于实时网络带宽约束的自适应扩散模型框架，通过端到端训练使模型能够根据目标质量水平调整去噪过程，实现早期停止采样以保持与传输条件相适应的感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型采用固定去噪步骤生成高保真图像，但在云到设备场景中，有限带宽需要重度压缩，导致精细纹理丢失和计算浪费。需要一种能根据带宽约束自适应调整生成质量的方法。

Method: 引入联合端到端训练策略，扩散模型以从可用带宽推导的目标质量水平为条件，学习自适应调制去噪过程，使用轻量级质量嵌入引导去噪轨迹，实现早期停止采样。

Result: 实验结果表明，与简单早期停止方法相比，该方法显著提高了带宽适应生成的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法为带宽受限环境中的高效图像传输提供了有前景的解决方案，且只需最小的架构改动。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

Motivation: 语言和视觉语言模型在广泛任务中表现出色，但其内部机制仍不完全清楚，需要研究注意力头如何专门处理特定属性。

Method: 基于现有可解释性方法，通过信号处理视角重新解释用最终解码层探测中间激活的实践，系统分析多个样本并基于相关性对注意力头进行排序。

Result: 在单模态和多模态变换器中均发现注意力头级别的专门化模式，仅编辑1%的注意力头即可可靠地抑制或增强目标概念，在问答、毒性缓解、图像分类和描述等任务中得到验证。

Conclusion: 注意力层内存在可解释和可控的结构，为理解和编辑大规模生成模型提供了简单工具。

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

Result: 模型成功学习将噪声几何结构转换为正确配置，在三个著名几何问题上获得近似解。

Conclusion: 图像空间操作为解决复杂几何问题提供了通用实用框架，建立了生成建模与几何问题求解之间的桥梁。

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Motivation: 脑膜瘤是最常见的原发性脑肿瘤，准确分割对治疗至关重要，但现有深度学习方法计算需求高、训练时间长，限制了在有限硬件条件下的应用。

Method: 集成三种架构：基础SegResNet、带注意力机制的SegResNet和双解码器U-Net，每个模型仅训练20个epoch。

Conclusion: 集成学习在有限硬件约束下也能实现有效的脑肿瘤分割，为脑膜瘤诊断提供了实用且易用的工具。

Abstract: Meningiomas represent the most prevalent form of primary brain tumors,
comprising nearly one-third of all diagnosed cases. Accurate delineation of
these tumors from MRI scans is crucial for guiding treatment strategies, yet
remains a challenging and time-consuming task in clinical practice. Recent
developments in deep learning have accelerated progress in automated tumor
segmentation; however, many advanced techniques are hindered by heavy
computational demands and long training schedules, making them less accessible
for researchers and clinicians working with limited hardware. In this work, we
propose a novel ensemble-based segmentation approach that combines three
distinct architectures: (1) a baseline SegResNet model, (2) an
attention-augmented SegResNet with concatenative skip connections, and (3) a
dual-decoder U-Net enhanced with attention-gated skip connections (DDUNet). The
ensemble aims to leverage architectural diversity to improve robustness and
accuracy while significantly reducing training demands. Each baseline model was
trained for only 20 epochs and Evaluated on the BraTS-MEN 2025 dataset. The
proposed ensemble model achieved competitive performance, with average
Lesion-Wise Dice scores of 77.30%, 76.37% and 73.9% on test dataset for
Enhancing Tumor (ET), Tumor Core (TC) and Whole Tumor (WT) respectively. These
results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning for brain tumor
segmentation, even under limited hardware constraints. Our proposed method
provides a practical and accessible tool for aiding the diagnosis of
meningioma, with potential impact in both clinical and research settings.

Conclusion: 等黎曼几何优化能够克服学得流形映射中固有的扭曲，为数据流形上的优化提供有效解决方案

Abstract: High-dimensional data that exhibit an intrinsic low-dimensional structure are
ubiquitous in machine learning and data science. While various approaches allow
for learning the corresponding data manifold from finite samples, performing
downstream tasks such as optimization directly on these learned manifolds
presents a significant challenge. This work introduces a principled framework
for optimization on learned data manifolds using iso-Riemannian geometry. Our
approach addresses key limitations of classical Riemannian optimization in this
setting, specifically, that the Levi-Civita connection fails to yield
constant-speed geodesics, and that geodesic convexity assumptions break down
under the learned pullback constructions commonly used in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose new notions of monotonicity and Lipschitz
continuity tailored to the iso-Riemannian setting and propose iso-Riemannian
descent algorithms for which we provide a detailed convergence analysis. We
demonstrate the practical effectiveness of those algorithms on both synthetic
and real datasets, including MNIST under a learned pullback structure. Our
approach yields interpretable barycentres, improved clustering, and provably
efficient solutions to inverse problems, even in high-dimensional settings.
These results establish that optimization under iso-Riemannian geometry can
overcome distortions inherent to learned manifold mappings.

Abstract: This work addresses the finite-time analysis of nonsmooth nonconvex
stochastic optimization under Riemannian manifold constraints. We adapt the
notion of Goldstein stationarity to the Riemannian setting as a performance
metric for nonsmooth optimization on manifolds. We then propose a Riemannian
Online to NonConvex (RO2NC) algorithm, for which we establish the sample
complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3}\delta^{-1})$ in finding
$(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points. This result is the first-ever
finite-time guarantee for fully nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization on manifolds
and matches the optimal complexity in the Euclidean setting. When gradient
information is unavailable, we develop a zeroth order version of RO2NC
algorithm (ZO-RO2NC), for which we establish the same sample complexity. The
numerical results support the theory and demonstrate the practical
effectiveness of the algorithms.

Conclusion: 连接统计决策理论与机制设计，展示如何利用异质性和策略性参与来提升假设检验效率

Abstract: We study hypothesis testing over a heterogeneous population of strategic
agents with private information. Any single test applied uniformly across the
population yields statistical error that is sub-optimal relative to the
performance of an oracle given access to the private information. We show how
it is possible to design menus of statistical contracts that pair type-optimal
tests with payoff structures, inducing agents to self-select according to their
private information. This separating menu elicits agent types and enables the
principal to match the oracle performance even without a priori knowledge of
the agent type. Our main result fully characterizes the collection of all
separating menus that are instance-adaptive, matching oracle performance for an
arbitrary population of heterogeneous agents. We identify designs where
information elicitation is essentially costless, requiring negligible
additional expense relative to a single-test benchmark, while improving
statistical performance. Our work establishes a connection between proper
scoring rules and menu design, showing how the structure of the hypothesis test
constrains the elicitable information. Numerical examples illustrate the
geometry of separating menus and the improvements they deliver in error
trade-offs. Overall, our results connect statistical decision theory with
mechanism design, demonstrating how heterogeneity and strategic participation
can be harnessed to improve efficiency in hypothesis testing.

Motivation: 为多智能体系统设计激励以诱导期望的纳什均衡是一个关键但具有挑战性的问题，特别是在智能体数量N很大时。现有方法在处理大规模系统时面临复杂性挑战。

Method: 在可交换性假设下，将激励设计问题形式化为参数化平均场博弈(PMFG)，通过无限人口极限降低复杂度。提出AMID算法，使用均衡算子的显式微分来高效计算梯度。

Conclusion: AMID算法结合了近似边界和优化保证，为大规模多智能体激励设计提供了一个强大且可扩展的算法工具，在拍卖等场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Designing incentives for a multi-agent system to induce a desirable Nash
equilibrium is both a crucial and challenging problem appearing in many
decision-making domains, especially for a large number of agents $N$. Under the
exchangeability assumption, we formalize this incentive design (ID) problem as
a parameterized mean-field game (PMFG), aiming to reduce complexity via an
infinite-population limit. We first show that when dynamics and rewards are
Lipschitz, the finite-$N$ ID objective is approximated by the PMFG at rate
$\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$. Moreover, beyond the Lipschitz-continuous
setting, we prove the same $\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ decay for the
important special case of sequential auctions, despite discontinuities in
dynamics, through a tailored auction-specific analysis. Built on our novel
approximation results, we further introduce our Adjoint Mean-Field Incentive
Design (AMID) algorithm, which uses explicit differentiation of iterated
equilibrium operators to compute gradients efficiently. By uniting
approximation bounds with optimization guarantees, AMID delivers a powerful,
scalable algorithmic tool for many-agent (large $N$) ID. Across diverse auction
settings, the proposed AMID method substantially increases revenue over
first-price formats and outperforms existing benchmark methods.

Abstract: We present a framework for solving a broad class of ill-posed inverse
problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), where the target
coefficients of the forward operator are recovered through an iterative
regularization scheme that alternates between FEM-based inversion and learned
graph neural regularization. The forward problem is numerically solved using
the finite element method (FEM), enabling applicability to a wide range of
geometries and PDEs. By leveraging the graph structure inherent to FEM
discretizations, we employ physics-inspired graph neural networks as learned
regularizers, providing a robust, interpretable, and generalizable alternative
to standard approaches. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework
outperforms classical regularization techniques and achieves accurate
reconstructions even in highly ill-posed scenarios.

Conclusion: 机器人位姿估计可以作为因果表示学习的近乎实用的测试平台，ROPES展示了无监督CRL在机器人领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Causal representation learning (CRL) has emerged as a powerful unsupervised
framework that (i) disentangles the latent generative factors underlying
high-dimensional data, and (ii) learns the cause-and-effect interactions among
the disentangled variables. Despite extensive recent advances in
identifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between
theory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap
by bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,
this paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of
position and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose
Estimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES
embodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative
factors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic
latent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,
and camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the
controllable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated
(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that
variables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In
robotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various
joints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in
semi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully
disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the
ground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional
changes, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison
with a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This
paper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical
testbed for CRL.

Abstract: Robotic suturing is a prototypical long-horizon dexterous manipulation task,
requiring coordinated needle grasping, precise tissue penetration, and secure
knot tying. Despite numerous efforts toward end-to-end autonomy, a fully
autonomous suturing pipeline has yet to be demonstrated on physical hardware.
We introduce SutureBot: an autonomous suturing benchmark on the da Vinci
Research Kit (dVRK), spanning needle pickup, tissue insertion, and knot tying.
To ensure repeatability, we release a high-fidelity dataset comprising 1,890
suturing demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a goal-conditioned framework
that explicitly optimizes insertion-point precision, improving targeting
accuracy by 59\%-74\% over a task-only baseline. To establish this task as a
benchmark for dexterous imitation learning, we evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language-action (VLA) models, including $\pi_0$, GR00T N1, OpenVLA-OFT,
and multitask ACT, each augmented with a high-level task-prediction policy.
Autonomous suturing is a key milestone toward achieving robotic autonomy in
surgery. These contributions support reproducible evaluation and development of
precision-focused, long-horizon dexterous manipulation policies necessary for

Motivation: 解决点云强化学习对相机姿态失配的敏感性，提高在现实环境中的可靠性

Method: PPC框架将任意刚性变换的点云映射到唯一的规范姿态，使观测对齐到一致坐标系

Result: 实验显示PPC在挑战性机器人任务中提高了对未见相机姿态的鲁棒性

Conclusion: PPC为领域随机化提供了原理性替代方案，显著减少视角引起的不一致性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) from raw visual input has achieved impressive
successes in recent years, yet it remains fragile to out-of-distribution
variations such as changes in lighting, color, and viewpoint. Point Cloud
Reinforcement Learning (PC-RL) offers a promising alternative by mitigating
appearance-based brittleness, but its sensitivity to camera pose mismatches
continues to undermine reliability in realistic settings. To address this
challenge, we propose PCA Point Cloud (PPC), a canonicalization framework
specifically tailored for downstream robotic control. PPC maps point clouds
under arbitrary rigid-body transformations to a unique canonical pose, aligning
observations to a consistent frame, thereby substantially decreasing
viewpoint-induced inconsistencies. In our experiments, we show that PPC
improves robustness to unseen camera poses across challenging robotic tasks,
providing a principled alternative to domain randomization.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pretraining robotic manipulation
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using a large corpus of unscripted
real-life video recordings of human hand activities. Treating human hand as
dexterous robot end-effector, we show that "in-the-wild" egocentric human
videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully
aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity
and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic
human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach
can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language
descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion.
We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training
dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide
range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment
variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data.
We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on
this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely
unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount
of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and
generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also
demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with
respect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation
for scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable
embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 实现安全可靠的现实世界机器人操作需要超越视觉感知，整合触觉传感来克服感官缺陷和对理想状态信息的依赖。尽管触觉传感有潜力，但在强化学习中的效果仍不一致。

Method: 开发自监督学习方法来更有效地利用触觉观测，专注于本体感觉和稀疏二进制接触的可扩展设置。通过分离SSL记忆与策略记忆来改进性能。

Result: 稀疏二进制触觉信号对灵巧性至关重要，特别是在本体感觉控制误差无法检测的机器人-物体解耦运动中。智能体在复杂接触任务（球弹跳和保定球旋转）中实现了超人类灵巧性。

Conclusion: 触觉传感对于机器人灵巧操作至关重要，自监督学习方法能有效利用触觉信号，发布的RoTO基准测试将促进触觉操作研究的标准化和未来发展。

Abstract: Achieving safe, reliable real-world robotic manipulation requires agents to
evolve beyond vision and incorporate tactile sensing to overcome sensory
deficits and reliance on idealised state information. Despite its potential,
the efficacy of tactile sensing in reinforcement learning (RL) remains
inconsistent. We address this by developing self-supervised learning (SSL)
methodologies to more effectively harness tactile observations, focusing on a
scalable setup of proprioception and sparse binary contacts. We empirically
demonstrate that sparse binary tactile signals are critical for dexterity,
particularly for interactions that proprioceptive control errors do not
register, such as decoupled robot-object motions. Our agents achieve superhuman
dexterity in complex contact tasks (ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation).
Furthermore, we find that decoupling the SSL memory from the on-policy memory
can improve performance. We release the Robot Tactile Olympiad (RoTO) benchmark
to standardise and promote future research in tactile-based manipulation.

Motivation: 研究推理在严格低误报率要求下的分类任务中的适用性，特别是在安全检测和幻觉检测等精度敏感应用中。

Method: 系统研究推理在分类任务中的表现，涵盖安全检测和幻觉检测两个任务，在微调和零样本设置下评估标准LLMs和大型推理模型，比较推理开启和关闭两种模式。

Result: 推理增强生成提高整体准确率，但在低误报率阈值下表现不佳；无推理模式在精度敏感场景中占优；基于token的评分优于自述置信度；两种模式的简单集成能结合各自优势。

Conclusion: 推理是双刃剑：有益于平均准确率，但通常不适合需要严格精度的应用场景。

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法，结合SFT和PPO的优势，通过自奖励机制改进LLM的监督微调，提升泛化能力和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT方法存在过拟合和域外泛化能力差的问题，特别是在数据有限的情况下。需要一种更有效的对齐方法。

Method: 结合SFT和PPO，设计基于SFT模型与预训练基础模型对数策略比率的自奖励函数，实现无需人工偏好标注的在线策略微调。

Result: 在多种NLP任务上的实证评估表明，Self-Rewarding PPO始终优于传统SFT方法，在高质量标注数据稀缺时表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: Self-Rewarding PPO提供了一种有效的LLM对齐方法，通过自奖励机制解决了SFT的关键限制，提高了泛化性、数据效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

Method: 提出新颖的分类体系：LLM for TAG（LLM增强图任务）和TAG for LLM（图结构提升LLM推理）。将编排策略分为顺序、并行和多模块框架，并讨论了TAG特定的预训练、提示和参数高效微调方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

Motivation: 在自由形式问答中准确估计LLM的语义偶然和认知不确定性具有挑战性，通常需要大量昂贵的生成来获得稳定估计。

Method: 使用轻调的自然语言推理模型在解码过程中注入连续语义相似性惩罚，覆盖自回归和掩码扩散范式，并通过重要性重加权和方差缩减技术优化不确定性估计。

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，该方法匹配或超越了基线方法，在相同样本数量下覆盖了更多语义簇。

Conclusion: 该框架是模块化的，无需访问基础LLM的梯度，可作为风险敏感模型部署中不确定性估计的即插即用增强方案。

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

Conclusion: 对于信息完整的任务，稳健的单轮训练比多轮训练更有效可靠，多轮训练提供的有限益处甚至可能降低推理能力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

Conclusion: 该工作使空间分析更易访问，为空间Text-to-SQL系统提供了稳健、可推广的基础，推动了自主GIS的发展。

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

TL;DR: 提出Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS)方法，通过分离概念组合的连贯性和文化典型性，在保持内部一致性的同时生成偏离文化惯例的新颖艺术概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型在艺术创作中要么遵循熟悉文化模式、要么牺牲连贯性追求新颖性的问题，需要同时保证原创性和内部一致性。

Method: 使用两个在WikiArt概念上微调的GPT-2模型：概念连贯性模型评估概念组合的合理性，文化语境模型估计组合在艺术家作品中的典型程度。CAS选择高连贯性、低典型性的组合。

Result: 在人类评估中优于随机选择和GPT-4o基线，与艺术专业学生表现相当；定量研究显示比GPT-4o产生更多样化输出和更广阔的概念空间探索。

Conclusion: 人工文化异化可以释放自主代理的创造潜力，在保持连贯性的同时生成新颖的艺术概念。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

TL;DR: 提出一个基于开源大语言模型的框架，用于从异构电子健康记录中提取阿片类药物使用障碍治疗处方信息，并计算标准化的药物覆盖天数指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不同电子健康记录系统中药物数据格式不统一的问题，特别是阿片类药物使用障碍治疗处方的标准化监测需求。

Method: 定制开源大语言模型（Llama、Qwen、Gemma、MedGemma）从异构数据中提取处方属性，通过JSON模式处理记录，并进行轻量级标准化和跨字段一致性检查。

Result: 在25,605条记录上评估，Qwen2.5-32B模型达到93.4%覆盖率和93.0%精确匹配准确率，MedGemma-27B达到93.1%/92.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了脆弱的站点特定ETL流程，支持本地隐私保护部署，为现实环境中MOUD暴露、依从性和保留的跨站点分析提供一致框架。

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MoSES框架，通过状态可分解MDP和潜在空间扩展，让统一求解器能够感知VRP变体的共享组件特性，重用基础求解器，避免神经网络求解器数量指数增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VRP多任务神经方法通常学习统一求解器同时处理多个约束，但未能充分利用VRP变体的组合结构，每个变体都可以从一组基础VRP变体推导而来，导致统一求解器错失了基础求解器的潜在优势。

Method: 提出状态可分解MDP(SDMDP)，将状态空间表示为与基础VRP变体相关的基础状态空间的笛卡尔积；开发潜在空间扩展，结合最优基础策略和可学习混合函数；实现MoSES求解器，通过专用LoRA专家实现基础策略，自适应门控机制实现混合函数。

Result: 在多个VRP变体上的广泛实验表明，MoSES优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过重用基础求解器，使统一求解器能够感知VRP变体的共享组件特性，在避免神经网络求解器数量指数增长的同时，实现了优越的性能。

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

Motivation: 现有智能体框架通常遵循预定义工作流程，限制了自主性和全局任务完成能力。现实世界任务需要外部工具和长时交互，现有方法难以处理多工具调用导致的上下文长度爆炸和交互历史累积问题。

Method: 提出自主记忆折叠机制压缩过去交互为结构化记忆，减少错误累积；开发端到端强化学习策略ToolPO，利用LLM模拟API并通过工具调用优势归因对工具调用token进行细粒度信用分配。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code
and demo are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/DeepAgent.

TL;DR: BACE是一个端到端框架，从多区域颅内局部场电位学习行为阶段特定的有向区域间连接性，通过预测目标训练，能准确恢复真实有向交互并揭示行为对齐的网络重构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解分布式脑区域如何协调产生行为需要既预测性强又可解释的模型。

Method: BACE通过每个解剖区域的时域编码器聚合微接触，应用特定行为阶段的可学习邻接矩阵，基于预测目标进行训练。

Result: 在合成数据上准确恢复真实有向交互，预测性能与最先进基线相当；在人类皮层下LFP数据中生成每个行为阶段的显式连接矩阵，揭示行为对齐的区域间影响重构。

Conclusion: BACE通过将预测成功与显式连接估计联系起来，为生成关于行为期间皮层下区域动态协调的数据驱动假设提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Understanding how distributed brain regions coordinate to produce behavior
requires models that are both predictive and interpretable. We introduce
Behavior-Adaptive Connectivity Estimation (BACE), an end-to-end framework that
learns phase-specific, directed inter-regional connectivity directly from
multi-region intracranial local field potentials (LFP). BACE aggregates many
micro-contacts within each anatomical region via per-region temporal encoders,
applies a learnable adjacency specific to each behavioral phase, and is trained
on a forecasting objective. On synthetic multivariate time series with known
graphs, BACE accurately recovers ground-truth directed interactions while
achieving forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines.
Applied to human subcortical LFP recorded simultaneously from eight regions
during a cued reaching task, BACE yields an explicit connectivity matrix for
each within-trial behavioral phase. The resulting behavioral phase-specific
graphs reveal behavior-aligned reconfiguration of inter-regional influence and
provide compact, interpretable adjacency matrices for comparing network
organization across behavioral phases. By linking predictive success to
explicit connectivity estimates, BACE offers a practical tool for generating
data-driven hypotheses about the dynamic coordination of subcortical regions
during behavior.

Conclusion: ProtoEEG-kNN模型成功实现了高准确率与强可解释性的平衡，能够帮助医生理解模型推理过程并识别潜在错误，改善了人机交互体验。

Abstract: The presence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings is a critical biomarker of epilepsy. Even
trained neurologists find detecting IEDs difficult, leading many practitioners
to turn to machine learning for help. While existing machine learning
algorithms can achieve strong accuracy on this task, most models are
uninterpretable and cannot justify their conclusions. Absent the ability to
understand model reasoning, doctors cannot leverage their expertise to identify
incorrect model predictions and intervene accordingly. To improve the
human-model interaction, we introduce ProtoEEG-kNN, an inherently interpretable
model that follows a simple case-based reasoning process. ProtoEEG-kNN reasons
by comparing an EEG to similar EEGs from the training set and visually
demonstrates its reasoning both in terms of IED morphology (shape) and spatial
distribution (location). We show that ProtoEEG-kNN can achieve state-of-the-art
accuracy in IED detection while providing explanations that experts prefer over
existing approaches.

Motivation: 理解生物和人工学习系统中表征漂移的来源对于揭示终身学习机制至关重要，但目前缺乏对漂移与数据分布、网络架构和学习规则关系的系统性研究。

Method: 在在线学习设置下，通过理论和模拟分析，研究了基于Hebbian学习（Oja规则和相似性匹配）和随机梯度下降（应用于自编码器和监督双层网络）中的表征漂移现象。

Result: 研究发现漂移率随任务无关子空间中数据方差和维度的增加而增加，这种漂移与高斯突触噪声产生的漂移在几何特性和维度依赖性上具有不同的定性预测。

Conclusion: 该研究将刺激结构、任务和学习规则与表征漂移联系起来，为利用漂移作为信号来揭示大脑底层计算机制开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Biological and artificial learners are inherently exposed to a stream of data
and experience throughout their lifetimes and must constantly adapt to, learn
from, or selectively ignore the ongoing input. Recent findings reveal that,
even when the performance remains stable, the underlying neural representations
can change gradually over time, a phenomenon known as representational drift.
Studying the different sources of data and noise that may contribute to drift
is essential for understanding lifelong learning in neural systems. However, a
systematic study of drift across architectures and learning rules, and the
connection to task, are missing. Here, in an online learning setup, we
characterize drift as a function of data distribution, and specifically show
that the learning noise induced by task-irrelevant stimuli, which the agent
learns to ignore in a given context, can create long-term drift in the
representation of task-relevant stimuli. Using theory and simulations, we
demonstrate this phenomenon both in Hebbian-based learning -- Oja's rule and
Similarity Matching -- and in stochastic gradient descent applied to
autoencoders and a supervised two-layer network. We consistently observe that
the drift rate increases with the variance and the dimension of the data in the
task-irrelevant subspace. We further show that this yields different
qualitative predictions for the geometry and dimension-dependency of drift than
those arising from Gaussian synaptic noise. Overall, our study links the
structure of stimuli, task, and learning rule to representational drift and
could pave the way for using drift as a signal for uncovering underlying
computation in the brain.

TL;DR: REvolution框架结合进化计算和LLM，通过双种群算法和自适应机制解决RTL代码生成中的功能正确性和PPA优化问题，显著提升通过率和设计质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于反馈的迭代方法在RTL代码生成中存在局部搜索限制，难以找到全局最优解，需要结合LLM的生成能力和进化计算的广泛搜索能力。

Method: 使用进化计算并行演化候选设计，采用双种群算法将候选分为失败组和成功组分别进行错误修复和PPA优化，并通过自适应机制动态调整提示策略选择概率。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM基准测试中，将各种LLM的初始通过率提升最高24.0个百分点，DeepSeek-V3模型达到95.5%的最终通过率，且生成的RTL设计在PPA方面显著优于参考设计。

Conclusion: REvolution通过结合LLM生成能力和进化计算搜索能力，克服了先前方法的局部搜索限制，为RTL设计提供了新方法，无需单独训练或领域特定工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code
generation, but they face two main challenges: functional correctness and
Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) optimization. Iterative, feedback-based
methods partially address these, but they are limited to local search,
hindering the discovery of a global optimum. This paper introduces REvolution,
a framework that combines Evolutionary Computation (EC) with LLMs for automatic
RTL generation and optimization. REvolution evolves a population of candidates
in parallel, each defined by a design strategy, RTL implementation, and
evaluation feedback. The framework includes a dual-population algorithm that
divides candidates into Fail and Success groups for bug fixing and PPA
optimization, respectively. An adaptive mechanism further improves search
efficiency by dynamically adjusting the selection probability of each prompt
strategy according to its success rate. Experiments on the VerilogEval and
RTLLM benchmarks show that REvolution increased the initial pass rate of
various LLMs by up to 24.0 percentage points. The DeepSeek-V3 model achieved a
final pass rate of 95.5\%, comparable to state-of-the-art results, without the
need for separate training or domain-specific tools. Additionally, the
generated RTL designs showed significant PPA improvements over reference
designs. This work introduces a new RTL design approach by combining LLMs'
generative capabilities with EC's broad search power, overcoming the
local-search limitations of previous methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物回路中常存在功能相似的模块，但尚不清楚果蝇嗅觉回路中的侧向抑制和神经元发放频率适应机制是冗余还是具有不同作用，特别是在复杂环境中的气味学习过程中。

Method: 建立果蝇嗅觉回路的计算模型，在不同噪声条件下模拟复杂环境，研究气味识别性能。

Result: 侧向抑制主要在低和中噪声条件下提升气味识别，但在高噪声下效果减弱甚至逆转；而神经元发放频率适应在所有噪声水平下都能持续改善识别性能。两种机制在不同噪声环境中优势互补，组合使用时能实现最佳识别性能。

Conclusion: 生物回路中看似冗余的模块实际上在复杂环境中对实现最优学习至关重要，侧向抑制和神经元发放频率适应机制在不同噪声条件下发挥互补作用。

Abstract: Biological circuits have evolved to incorporate multiple modules that perform
similar functions. In the fly olfactory circuit, both lateral inhibition (LI)
and neuronal spike frequency adaptation (SFA) are thought to enhance pattern
separation for odor learning. However, it remains unclear whether these
mechanisms play redundant or distinct roles in this process. In this study, we
present a computational model of the fly olfactory circuit to investigate odor
discrimination under varying noise conditions that simulate complex
environments. Our results show that LI primarily enhances odor discrimination
in low- and medium-noise scenarios, but this benefit diminishes and may reverse
under higher-noise conditions. In contrast, SFA consistently improves
discrimination across all noise levels. LI is preferentially engaged in low-
and medium-noise environments, whereas SFA dominates in high-noise settings.
When combined, these two sparsification mechanisms enable optimal
discrimination performance. This work demonstrates that seemingly redundant
modules in biological circuits can, in fact, be essential for achieving optimal
learning in complex contexts.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem has become a fundamental tool in
computational optimal transport and generative modeling. To address this
problem, ideal methods such as Iterative Proportional Fitting and Iterative
Markovian Fitting (IMF) have been proposed-alongside practical approximations
like Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge and its Matching (DSBM) variant. While
previous work have established asymptotic convergence guarantees for IMF, a
quantitative, non-asymptotic understanding remains unknown. In this paper, we
provide the first non-asymptotic exponential convergence guarantees for IMF
under mild structural assumptions on the reference measure and marginal
distributions, assuming a sufficiently large time horizon. Our results
encompass two key regimes: one where the marginals are log-concave, and another
where they are weakly log-concave. The analysis relies on new contraction
results for the Markovian projection operator and paves the way to theoretical
guarantees for DSBM.

Abstract: Adversarial training has emerged as a key technique to enhance model
robustness against adversarial input perturbations. Many of the existing
methods rely on computationally expensive min-max problems that limit their
application in practice. We propose a novel formulation of adversarial training
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, shifting from input to feature-space
perturbations. This reformulation enables the exact solution of inner
maximization and efficient optimization. It also provides a regularized
estimator that naturally adapts to the noise level and the smoothness of the
underlying function. We establish conditions under which the feature-perturbed
formulation is a relaxation of the original problem and propose an efficient
optimization algorithm based on iterative kernel ridge regression. We provide
generalization bounds that help to understand the properties of the method. We
also extend the formulation to multiple kernel learning. Empirical evaluation
shows good performance in both clean and adversarial settings.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness is a socially crucial topic in real-world applications
of AI.
  Among many notions of fairness, subgroup fairness is widely studied when
multiple sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, age) are present.
  However, as the number of sensitive attributes grows, the number of subgroups
increases accordingly, creating heavy computational burdens and data sparsity
problem (subgroups with too small sizes).
  In this paper, we develop a novel learning algorithm for subgroup fairness
which resolves these issues by focusing on subgroups with sufficient sample
sizes as well as marginal fairness (fairness for each sensitive attribute).
  To this end, we formalize a notion of subgroup-subset fairness and introduce
a corresponding distributional fairness measure called the supremum Integral
Probability Metric (supIPM).
  Building on this formulation, we propose the Doubly Regressing Adversarial
learning for subgroup Fairness (DRAF) algorithm, which reduces a surrogate
fairness gap for supIPM with much less computation than directly reducing
supIPM.
  Theoretically, we prove that the proposed surrogate fairness gap is an upper
bound of supIPM.
  Empirically, we show that the DRAF algorithm outperforms baseline methods in
benchmark datasets, specifically when the number of sensitive attributes is
large so that many subgroups are very small.

Abstract: Probabilistic models must be well calibrated to support reliable
decision-making. While calibration in single-output regression is well studied,
defining and achieving multivariate calibration in multi-output regression
remains considerably more challenging. The existing literature on multivariate
calibration primarily focuses on diagnostic tools based on pre-rank functions,
which are projections that reduce multivariate prediction-observation pairs to
univariate summaries to detect specific types of miscalibration. In this work,
we go beyond diagnostics and introduce a general regularization framework to
enforce multivariate calibration during training for arbitrary pre-rank
functions. This framework encompasses existing approaches such as highest
density region calibration and copula calibration. Our method enforces
calibration by penalizing deviations of the projected probability integral
transforms (PITs) from the uniform distribution, and can be added as a
regularization term to the loss function of any probabilistic predictor.
Specifically, we propose a regularization loss that jointly enforces both
marginal and multivariate pre-rank calibration. We also introduce a new
PCA-based pre-rank that captures calibration along directions of maximal
variance in the predictive distribution, while also enabling dimensionality
reduction. Across 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that
unregularized models are consistently miscalibrated, and that our methods
significantly improve calibration across all pre-rank functions without
sacrificing predictive accuracy.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the combinatorial semi-bandit problem where an agent selects a
subset of base arms and receives individual feedback. While this generalizes
the classical multi-armed bandit and has broad applicability, its scalability
is limited by the high cost of combinatorial optimization, requiring oracle
queries at every round. To tackle this, we propose oracle-efficient frameworks
that significantly reduce oracle calls while maintaining tight regret
guarantees. For the worst-case linear reward setting, our algorithms achieve
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret using only $O(\log\log T)$ oracle queries. We also
propose covariance-adaptive algorithms that leverage noise structure for
improved regret, and extend our approach to general (non-linear) rewards.
Overall, our methods reduce oracle usage from linear to (doubly) logarithmic in
time, with strong theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Flow and diffusion-based models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific
applications, particularly for sampling non-normalized probability
distributions, as exemplified by Boltzmann Generators (BGs). A critical
challenge in deploying these models is their reliance on sample likelihood
computations, which scale prohibitively with system size $n$, often rendering
them infeasible for large-scale problems. To address this, we introduce
$\textit{HollowFlow}$, a flow-based generative model leveraging a novel
non-backtracking graph neural network (NoBGNN). By enforcing a block-diagonal
Jacobian structure, HollowFlow likelihoods are evaluated with a constant number
of backward passes in $n$, yielding speed-ups of up to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$: a
significant step towards scaling BGs to larger systems. Crucially, our
framework generalizes: $\textbf{any equivariant GNN or attention-based
architecture}$ can be adapted into a NoBGNN. We validate HollowFlow by training
BGs on two different systems of increasing size. For both systems, the sampling
and likelihood evaluation time decreases dramatically, following our
theoretical scaling laws. For the larger system we obtain a $10^2\times$
speed-up, clearly illustrating the potential of HollowFlow-based approaches for
high-dimensional scientific problems previously hindered by computational
bottlenecks.

Abstract: We introduce a highly expressive yet distinctly tractable family for
black-box variational inference (BBVI). Each member of this family is a
weighted product of experts (PoE), and each weighted expert in the product is
proportional to a multivariate $t$-distribution. These products of experts can
model distributions with skew, heavy tails, and multiple modes, but to use them
for BBVI, we must be able to sample from their densities. We show how to do
this by reformulating these products of experts as latent variable models with
auxiliary Dirichlet random variables. These Dirichlet variables emerge from a
Feynman identity, originally developed for loop integrals in quantum field
theory, that expresses the product of multiple fractions (or in our case,
$t$-distributions) as an integral over the simplex. We leverage this simplicial
latent space to draw weighted samples from these products of experts -- samples
which BBVI then uses to find the PoE that best approximates a target density.
Given a collection of experts, we derive an iterative procedure to optimize the
exponents that determine their geometric weighting in the PoE. At each
iteration, this procedure minimizes a regularized Fisher divergence to match
the scores of the variational and target densities at a batch of samples drawn
from the current approximation. This minimization reduces to a convex quadratic
program, and we prove under general conditions that these updates converge
exponentially fast to a near-optimal weighting of experts. We conclude by
evaluating this approach on a variety of synthetic and real-world target
distributions.

Abstract: Maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding for arbitrary block codes remains
fundamentally hard, with worst-case time complexity-measured by the total
number of multiplications-being no better than straightforward exhaustive
search, which requires $q^{k} n$ operations for an $[n,k]_q$ code. This paper
introduces a simple, code-agnostic framework that reduces the worst-case
complexity by a factor of $n$, down to $q^{k}$ operations, a highly desirable
reduction in practice. The result holds for both linear and nonlinear block
codes over general memoryless channels and under both hard-decision and
soft-decision decoding. It naturally extends to intersymbol-interference (ISI)
channels and ML list decoding with only a negligible increase in complexity.
Our core insight is that, upon receipt of each sequence at the receiver, the
conditional probability of that sequence for each codeword in the codebook
(i.e., the \emph{likelihood}) can be expressed as the inner product of two
carefully constructed vectors -- the first depending on the received sequence,
and the second on that codeword itself. As a result, evaluating the likelihoods
for all codewords in the codebook reduces to a single vector-matrix
multiplication, and ML decoding (MLD) becomes the simple task of picking the
maximum entry in the resulting vector. The only non-trivial cost lies in the
vector-matrix product. However, our matrix construction allows the use of the
Mailman algorithm to reduce this cost. This time reduction is achieved at the
cost of high space complexity, requiring $\mathcal{O}(q^{k+1} n)$ space to
store the pre-computed codebook matrix.

Abstract: Generative models that maximize model likelihood have gained traction in many
practical settings. Among them, perturbation based approaches underpin many
strong likelihood estimation models, yet they often face slow convergence and
limited theoretical understanding. In this paper, we derive a tighter
likelihood bound for noise driven models to improve both the accuracy and
efficiency of maximum likelihood learning. Our key insight extends the
classical KL divergence Fisher information relationship to arbitrary noise
perturbations, going beyond the Gaussian assumption and enabling structured
noise distributions. This formulation allows flexible use of randomized noise
distributions that naturally account for sensor artifacts, quantization
effects, and data distribution smoothing, while remaining compatible with
standard diffusion training. Treating the diffusion process as a Gaussian
channel, we further express the mismatched entropy between data and model,
showing that the proposed objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood
(NLL). In experiments, our models achieve competitive NLL on CIFAR-10 and SOTA
results on ImageNet across multiple resolutions, all without data augmentation,
and the framework extends naturally to discrete data.
