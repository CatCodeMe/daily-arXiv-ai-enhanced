This system operates in what is referred to as a dense reader environment, where readers are placed close to each other to optimize coverage. However, this setup comes with its challenges, as it increases the likelihood of collisions between readers and tags (reader-to-reader and reader-to-tag), leading to reduced network performance. To address this issue, various protocols have been proposed, with centralized solutions emerging as promising options due to their ability to deliver higher throughput. In this paper, we propose the Intelligence and Efficient Reader Anti-collision Protocol (IE-RAP) that improves network performance such as throughput, average waiting time, and energy consumption, which employs a powerful combination of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) mechanisms. IE-RAP improves the efficiency of RFID networks through techniques such as the SIFT function and distance calculation between readers. By preventing re-read tags and ensuring the on-time release of the communication channel, we effectively eliminate unnecessary collisions. Our simulations emphasize the superiority of our proposed method, it increases 26% throughput, reduces 74% the average waiting time, and lower by 52% the energy consumption compared to existing approaches. Importantly, our solution supports the seamless integration of mobile readers within the network.", "AI": {"tldr": "IE-RAP\u534f\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408TDMA\u548cFDMA\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SIFT\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8bfb\u8005\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347RFID\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u79fb\u52a8\u8bfb\u8005\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bfb\u8005\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cRFID\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u8bfb\u8005\u4e0e\u8bfb\u8005\u3001\u8bfb\u8005\u4e0e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9700\u8981\u652f\u6301\u79fb\u52a8\u8bfb\u8005\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIE-RAP\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408TDMA\u548cFDMA\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528SIFT\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8bfb\u8005\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u91cd\u590d\u8bfb\u53d6\u6807\u7b7e\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\u53ca\u65f6\u91ca\u653e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u534726%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1174%\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e52%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u79fb\u52a8\u8bfb\u8005\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "IE-RAP\u534f\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u9632\u78b0\u649e\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86RFID\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bfb\u8005\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u9700\u8981\u79fb\u52a8\u8bfb\u8005\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

The core challenge in split learning is to minimize the training time by jointly devising the client-helper assignment and the schedule of tasks at the helpers. We first study the model where each helper has a memory cardinality constraint on how many clients it may be assigned, which represents the case of homogeneous tasks. Through complexity theory, we rule out exact polynomial-time algorithms and approximation schemes even for highly restricted instances of this problem. We complement these negative results with a non-trivial polynomial-time 5-approximation algorithm. Building on this, we then focus on the more general heterogeneous task setting considered by Tirana et al. [INFOCOM 2024], where helpers have memory capacity constraints and clients have variable memory costs. In this case, we prove that, unless P=NP, the problem cannot admit a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for any approximation factor. However, by adapting our aforementioned 5-approximation algorithm, we develop a novel heuristic for the heterogeneous task setting and show that it outperforms heuristics from prior works through extensive experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u540c\u8d28\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef-\u52a9\u624b\u5206\u914d\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u7814\u7a76\u540c\u8d28\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u52a9\u624b\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u57fa\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5e76\u5f00\u53d15-\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5f02\u8d28\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u52a9\u624b\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6709\u53ef\u53d8\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u540c\u8d28\u4efb\u52a1\u95ee\u9898\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u51fa\u4e865-\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u5f02\u8d28\u4efb\u52a1\u95ee\u9898\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u8fd1\u4f3c\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef-\u52a9\u624b\u5206\u914d\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While traditional terrestrial relays (TR) are constrained by fixed locations and vulnerability to physical obstructions, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted aerial relays (AR) offer a dynamic and flexible alternative by operating above obstacles and adapting to changing battlefield conditions. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AR systems in military communications, presenting a detailed comparison between AR and TR paradigms and examining two specific AR technologies: active aerial relays (AAR) and aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) relays. The survey delves into their operation, benefits, challenges, and military applications, supported by a qualitative analysis across metrics such as coverage, flexibility, security, and cost. A novel multi-dimensional metric, the mission-critical relay effectiveness score (MCRES), is introduced as a quantitative method for evaluating relay suitability based on mission-specific weights for critical attributes like mobility, jamming resilience, deployment speed, stealth, coverage, and autonomy. Furthermore, we present Algorithm 1, a decision-making framework that leverages the MCRES to guide the systematic selection of the optimal relay type, AR or TR, and subsequently AAR or ARIS, tailored to the unique demands of a given military scenario, such as dynamic battlefield operations, electronic warfare, or covert missions. Finally, the paper addresses current implementation challenges and outlines promising future research directions to advance the deployment of robust and resilient UAV-mounted relay systems in contested military environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9\u519b\u4e8b\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u8c03\u7814\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4e2d\u7ee7\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5730\u9762\u4e2d\u7ee7\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4e2d\u7ee7\u548c\u7a7a\u4e2d\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u952e\u4e2d\u7ee7\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5730\u9762\u4e2d\u7ee7\u5728\u519b\u4e8b\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u56fa\u5b9a\u3001\u6613\u53d7\u7269\u7406\u969c\u788d\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u642d\u8f7d\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u6001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u6218\u573a\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "1. \u5bf9\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8c03\u7814\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u952e\u4e2d\u7ee7\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eMCRES\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u519b\u4e8b\u573a\u666f\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u7684MCRES\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u4e2d\u7ee7\u9009\u62e9\u51b3\u7b56\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u519b\u4e8b\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0cMCRES\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6218\u573a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4e2d\u7ee7\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u65bd\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u63a8\u8fdb\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In practice, many bug reports convey critical information visually (e.g., layout breakage or missing widgets), but directly using such dense visual inputs often causes context loss and noise, making it difficult for MLLMs to ground visual observations into precise fault localization and executable patches. To bridge this semantic gap, we propose \\textbf{SVRepair}, a multimodal APR framework with structured visual representation. SVRepair first fine-tunes a vision-language model, \\textbf{Structured Visual Representation (SVR)}, to uniformly transform heterogeneous visual artifacts into a \\emph{semantic scene graph} that captures GUI elements and their structural relations (e.g., hierarchy), providing normalized, code-relevant context for downstream repair. Building on the graph, SVRepair drives a coding agent to localize faults and synthesize patches, and further introduces an iterative visual-artifact segmentation strategy that progressively narrows the input to bug-centered regions to suppress irrelevant context and reduce hallucinations.

This work introduces QEIL, Quantifying Edge Intelligence via Inference time Scaling Laws, a unified framework for efficient local LLM inference using principled scaling laws and heterogeneous orchestration across CPU, GPU, and NPU accelerators. We derive five architecture agnostic theorems that characterize how inference efficiency scales with model size, sample budget, and device level constraints. QEIL integrates three optimization dimensions. First, inference time scaling laws show that heterogeneous workload distribution achieves superlinear efficiency gains that are not observed in homogeneous execution. Second, hardware aware routing is enabled through analytical cost models that account for compute throughput, memory bandwidth, power consumption, and thermal limits. Third, performance energy trade offs are quantified using novel metrics including Intelligence Per Watt, Energy Coverage Efficiency, and Price Power Performance. A unified orchestrator combines these components through progressive sample multiplexing to improve coverage. Extensive evaluation across five model families from 125M to 2.6B parameters demonstrates consistent gains, including 7 to 10.5 percentage point improvement in pass at k coverage, 35.6 to 78.2 percent energy reduction, 68 percent average power reduction enabling edge thermal budgets, 15.8 percent latency improvement, and zero accuracy loss.

A critical instance of this paradigm is filtered Approximate k Nearest Neighbor (AKNN) search, where embeddings (e.g., image or text) are queried alongside constraints such as labels or numerical range. While essential for rich retrieval, optimizing these queries remains challenging due to the highly variable search cost induced by combined filters. In this paper, we propose a novel cost estimation framework, E2E, for filtered AKNN search and demonstrate its utility in downstream optimization tasks, specifically early termination. Unlike existing approaches, our model explicitly captures the correlation between the query vector distribution and attribute-value selectivity, yielding significantly higher estimation accuracy. By leveraging these estimates to refine search termination conditions, we achieve substantial performance gains.

We provide a probabilistic framework for two dominant paradigms: code selection after generation using the execution environment, and code generation conditioned on environment feedback. First, we formalize several well-established selection heuristics as environment-aware estimators of code correctness. We theoretically prove that estimators based on fuzzy functional similarity add an inductive bias and strictly dominate estimators based on functional equivalence in terms of signal-to-noise ratio. Second, we frame backprompting as an in-context approximation of Thompson sampling. We derive a novel regret bound for reward functions with unobservable components, theoretically explaining why the effectiveness of backprompting is limited by the ambiguity of the informal task description (an irreducible regret). Using three state-of-the-art open weight models, we corroborate these findings across BigCodeBenchHard, LeetCodeDataset, and QiskitHumanEvalSim.

However, extracting exact and complete information using range queries is costly. As a remedy, some previous work proposed a faster principle, {\\em approximate} search with range queries, also called single range cover (SRC) search. It can, however, produce some false positives. In this work we introduce a new SRC search structure, a $c$-DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), which provably decreases the average number of false positives by logarithmic factor while keeping asymptotically same time and memory complexities as a classic tree structure. A $c$-DAG is a tunable augmentation of the 1D-Tree with denser overlapping branches ($c \\geq 3$ children per node). We perform a competitive analysis of a $c$-DAG with respect to 1D-Tree and derive an additive constant time overhead and a multiplicative logarithmic improvement of the false positives ratio, on average. We also provide a generic framework to extend our results to empirical distributions of queries, and demonstrate its effectiveness for Gowalla dataset. Finally, we quantify and discuss security and privacy aspects of SRC search on $c$-DAG vs 1D-Tree, mainly mitigation of structural leakage, which makes $c$-DAG a good data structure candidate for deployment in privacy-preserving systems (e.g., searchable encryption) and multimedia retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5355\u8303\u56f4\u8986\u76d6(SRC)\u641c\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784c-DAG\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf1D-Tree\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "motivation": "\u8303\u56f4\u67e5\u8be2\u5728\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u7cbe\u786e\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u67e5\u8be2\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SRC\u641c\u7d22\uff09\u867d\u7136\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8bef\u62a5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fac-DAG\uff08\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a1D-Tree\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u589e\u5f3a\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u6709c\u22653\u4e2a\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u66f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u5206\u652f\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6bd4\u8f83c-DAG\u4e0e1D-Tree\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "c-DAG\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6e10\u8fd1\u76f8\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u3002\u5728Gowalla\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "c-DAG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684SRC\u641c\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf1D-Tree\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u641c\u7d22\u52a0\u5bc6\u548c\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u7b49\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

For decoding, we introduce FusedDQP, which fuses dequantization and projection into a single kernel, and FlowKV, which re-structures attention to sustain high memory bandwidth utilization. Together with a compact Q4NX 4-bit quantization format, these methods yield up to $5.2\\times$ faster prefill and $4.8\\times$ faster decoding versus the iGPU, and $33.5\\times$ and $2.2\\times$ over the CPU, respectively. Power efficiency improves by as much as $67.2\\times$ and $222.9\\times$ compared to the iGPU and CPU.

This paper proposes an event-first, frequency-aware forecasting paradigm that directly predicts ramp events and reconstructs the power trajectory thereafter, rather than inferring events from dense forecasts. The framework is built on an enhanced Ramping Behaviour Analysis (RBA$_\u03b8$) method's event representation and progressively integrates statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models. Traditional forecasting models with post-hoc event extraction provides a strong interpretable baseline but exhibits limited generalisation across sites. Direct event prediction using Random Forests improves robustness over survival-based formulations, motivating fully event-aware modelling. To capture the multi-scale nature of wind ramps, we introduce an event-first deep architecture that integrates wavelet-based frequency decomposition, temporal excitation features, and adaptive feature selection. The resulting sequence models enable stable long-horizon event prediction, physically consistent trajectory reconstruction, and zero-shot transfer to previously unseen wind farms. Empirical analysis shows that ramp magnitude and duration are governed by distinct mid-frequency bands, allowing accurate signal reconstruction from sparse event forecasts. An agentic forecasting layer is proposed, in which specialised workflows are selected dynamically based on operational context. Together, the framework demonstrates that event-first, frequency-aware forecasting provides a transferable and operationally aligned alternative to trajectory-first wind-power prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\"\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4f18\u5148\u3001\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\"\u7684\u98ce\u7535\u722c\u5761\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u722c\u5761\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e76\u91cd\u5efa\u529f\u7387\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ece\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u6fc0\u52b1\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u65b0\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u98ce\u7535\u722c\u5761\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7531\u4e8e\u5f3a\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7ad9\u70b9\u7279\u5b9a\u6c14\u8c61\u6548\u5e94\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u9a8c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8de8\u7ad9\u70b9\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e76\u91cd\u5efa\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4f18\u5148\u3001\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\uff1b2. \u57fa\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684RBA\u03b8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\uff1b3. \u6e10\u8fdb\u6574\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff1b4. \u5f15\u5165\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5c0f\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u6fc0\u52b1\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\uff1b5. \u63d0\u51fa\u667a\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5c42\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e13\u95e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "result": "1. \u76f4\u63a5\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u5b58\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff1b2. \u4e8b\u4ef6\u4f18\u5148\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u957f\u671f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b3. \u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b4. \u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u98ce\u7535\u573a\uff1b5. \u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u722c\u5761\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e2d\u9891\u5e26\u63a7\u5236\uff1b6. \u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4f18\u5148\u3001\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3a\u98ce\u7535\u529f\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e14\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5148\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u7ad9\u70b9\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

We present an automated mobile chaos testing system that integrates DragonCrawl, an LLM-based mobile testing platform, with uHavoc, a service-level fault injection system. The key insight is that adaptive AI-driven test execution can navigate mobile applications under degraded backend conditions, eliminating the need to manually write test cases for each combination of user flow, city, and failure type. Since Q1 2024, our system has executed over 180,000 automated chaos tests across 47 critical flows in Uber's Rider, Driver, and Eats applications, representing approximately 39,000 hours of manual testing effort that would be impractical at this scale. We identified 23 resilience risks, with 70% being architectural dependency violations where non-critical service failures degraded core user flows. Twelve issues were severe enough to prevent trip requests or food orders. Two caused application crashes detectable only through mobile chaos testing, not backend testing alone. Automated root cause analysis reduced debugging time from hours to minutes, achieving 88% precision@5 in attributing mobile failures to specific backend services.

In the literature, the quantum state preparation algorithm by Sun et al. is known to be optimally bounded, defining the asymptotically optimal width-depth trade-off bounds with and without ancillary qubits. In this work, a simpler algebraic decomposition is proposed to separate the preparation of the real part of the desired state from the complex one, resulting in a reduction in terms of circuit depth, total gates, and CNOT count when $m$ ancillary qubits are available. The reduction in complexity is due to the use of a single operator $\u039b$ for each uniformly controlled gate, instead of the three in the original decomposition. Using the PennyLane library, this new algorithm for state preparation has been implemented and tested in a simulated environment for both dense and sparse quantum states, including those that are random and of physical interest. Furthermore, its performance has been compared with that of M\u00f6tt\u00f6nen et al.'s algorithm, which is a de facto standard for preparing quantum states in cases where no ancillary qubits are used, highlighting interesting lines of development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5236\u5907\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u5b9e\u90e8\u548c\u865a\u90e8\uff0c\u5728\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u603b\u95e8\u6570\u548cCNOT\u95e8\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5236\u5907\u662f\u8bb8\u591a\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5b50\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u5982Sun\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u77e5\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u8def\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6709\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u90e8\u548c\u865a\u90e8\u5206\u79bb\u5236\u5907\u3002\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5747\u5300\u63a7\u5236\u95e8\u53ea\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u039b\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u539f\u59cb\u5206\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u3002\u8fd9\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u603b\u95e8\u6570\u548cCNOT\u95e8\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6709m\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7535\u8def\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7PennyLane\u5e93\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a20\u5bc6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u968f\u673a\u6001\u548c\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u6001\u3002\u4e0eM\u00f6tt\u00f6nen\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u65e0\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5236\u5907\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u5b9e\u865a\u90e8\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5747\u5300\u63a7\u5236\u95e8\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7535\u8def\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5236\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While effective at producing fluent text, this design biases models toward high-probability continuations rather than exhaustive and faithful answers grounded in source content. As a result, directly applying LLMs lacks systematic mechanisms to ensure both completeness (avoiding omissions) and faithfulness (avoiding unsupported content), which fundamentally conflicts with core AI safety principles. To address this limitation, we present EVE, a structured framework for document-grounded reasoning.\n  Unlike free-form prompting, EVE constrains generation to a structured, verifiable pipeline that decomposes high-rigor reasoning into extraction, validation, and enumeration. Empirically, this design enables consistent and simultaneous improvements in recall, precision, and F1-score: recall and precision increase by up to 24\\% and 29\\%, respectively, with a corresponding 31\\% gain in F1-score. This effectively breaks the long-standing trade-off between coverage and accuracy typical of single-pass LLM generation, while also mitigating generation truncation caused by length limitations.

We further discuss how trustworthiness can be evaluated and demonstrated, highlighting a fundamental trust measurement gap: not everything that matters for trust can be easily measured.

This paper introduces the Hybrid Quantization and Pruning (HQP) framework, a novel, integrated methodology designed to achieve synergistic model acceleration while adhering to strict quality guarantees. We detail a sensitivity-aware structural pruning algorithm that employs a dynamic weight sensitivity metric, derived from a highly efficient approximation of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), to guide the iterative removal of redundant filters. This pruning is strictly conditional, enforcing an adherence to a maximum permissible accuracy drop (Delta ax) before the model proceeds to 8-bit post-training quantization. This rigorous coordination is critical, as it ensures the resultant sparse model structure is maximally robust to quantization error and hardware-specific kernel optimization. Exhaustive evaluation across heterogeneous NVIDIA Jetson edge platforms, utilizing resource-efficient architectures like MobileNetV3 and ResNet-18, demonstrates that the HQP framework achieves a peak performance gain of 3.12 times inference speedup and a 55 percent model size reduction, while rigorously containing the accuracy drop below the 1.5 percent constraint.

Unfortunately, understanding and debugging such agents remain challenging due to their complex and dynamic nature. Developers must reason about trajectories of LLM queries, tool calls, and code modifications, but current techniques reveal little of this intermediate process in a comprehensible format. The key insight of this paper is that debugging software development agents shares many similarities with conventional debugging of software programs, yet requires a higher level of abstraction that raises the level from low-level implementation details to high-level agent actions. Drawing on this insight, we introduce AgentStepper, the first interactive debugger for LLM-based software engineering agents. AgentStepper enables developers to inspect, control, and interactively manipulate agent trajectories. AgentStepper represents trajectories as structured conversations among an LLM, the agent program, and tools. It supports breakpoints, stepwise execution, and live editing of prompts and tool invocations, while capturing and displaying intermediate repository-level code changes. Our evaluation applies AgentStepper to three state-of-the-art software development agents, ExecutionAgent, SWE-Agent, and RepairAgent, showing that integrating the approach into existing agents requires minor code changes (39-42 edited lines). Moreover, we report on a user study with twelve participants, indicating that AgentStepper improves the ability of participants to interpret trajectories (64% vs. 67% mean performance) and identify bugs in the agent's implementation (17% vs. 60% success rate), while reducing perceived workload (e.g., frustration reduced from 5.4/7.0 to 2.4/7.0) compared to conventional tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentStepper\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8c03\u8bd5\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8868\u793a\u3001\u65ad\u70b9\u3001\u9010\u6b65\u6267\u884c\u7b49\u529f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u8bd5\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4ee3\u7406\u96be\u4ee5\u8c03\u8bd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u7684LLM\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u4fee\u6539\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c55\u793a", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgentStepper\u8c03\u8bd5\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u4ee3\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u8868\u793a\u4e3aLLM\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65ad\u70b9\u3001\u9010\u6b65\u6267\u884c\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u6355\u83b7\u663e\u793a\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u4ee3\u7406\uff08ExecutionAgent\u3001SWE-Agent\u3001RepairAgent\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ec5\u970039-42\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u4fee\u6539\u5373\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8f68\u8ff9\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\uff0864% vs 67%\uff09\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8bug\u8bc6\u522b\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0817% vs 60%\uff09\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff08\u632b\u8d25\u611f\u4ece5.4/7.0\u964d\u81f32.4/7.0\uff09", "conclusion": "AgentStepper\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4f20\u7edf\u8c03\u8bd5\u4f46\u66f4\u9ad8\u62bd\u8c61\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8c03\u8bd5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86LLM\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u8bd5\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8c03\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177"}}

Our construction yields monotone circuit walks, giving the same bound for the monotone circuit diameter.\n  The circuit diameter, introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold, and Hemmecke (SIDMA 2015), is a natural relaxation of the combinatorial diameter that allows steps along circuit directions rather than only along edges. All prior upper bounds on the circuit diameter were only weakly polynomial. Finding a circuit augmentation algorithm that matches this bound would yield a strongly polynomial time algorithm for linear programming, resolving Smale's 9th problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7535\u8def\u76f4\u5f84\u7684\u5f3a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4e0a\u754cO(m\u00b2log m)\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0fHirsch\u731c\u60f3\u7684\u7535\u8def\u7c7b\u6bd4\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u7535\u8def\u76f4\u5f84\u662f\u7ec4\u5408\u76f4\u5f84\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u677e\u5f1b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6cbf\u7535\u8def\u65b9\u5411\u79fb\u52a8\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u6cbf\u8fb9\u79fb\u52a8\u3002\u5148\u524d\u4e0a\u754c\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5f31\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u5339\u914d\u6b64\u754c\u7684\u7535\u8def\u589e\u5e7f\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5f3a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u95ee\u9898\uff08Smale\u7b2c9\u95ee\u9898\uff09", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u5355\u8c03\u7535\u8def\u884c\u8d70\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u591a\u9762\u4f53P={x\u2208\u211d\u207f: Ax=b, x\u22650}\u7684\u7535\u8def\u76f4\u5f84\u4e0a\u754c\u4e3aO(m\u00b2log m)", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7535\u8def\u76f4\u5f84\u7684\u5f3a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4e0a\u754cO(m\u00b2log m)\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u8c03\u7535\u8def\u76f4\u5f84", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7535\u8def\u76f4\u5f84\u7684\u5f3a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4e0a\u754c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5f3a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840"}}

Models such as logistic regression (LR) offer transparency, while neural networks (NNs) provide greater predictive power; yet both remain vulnerable to privacy attacks. We empirically assess these risks by designing attacks that identify which public datasets were used to train a model under varying levels of adversarial access, applying them to LORIS, a publicly available LR model for immunotherapy response prediction, as well as to additional shallow NN models trained for the same task. Our results show that both models leak significant training-set information, with LRs proving particularly vulnerable in white-box scenarios. Moreover, we observe that common practices such as cross-validation in LRs exacerbate these risks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose a quantum-inspired defense based on tensorizing discretized models into tensor trains (TTs), which fully obfuscates parameters while preserving accuracy, reducing white-box attacks to random guessing and degrading black-box attacks comparably to Differential Privacy. TT models retain LR interpretability and extend it through efficient computation of marginal and conditional distributions, while also enabling this higher level of interpretability for NNs. Our results demonstrate that tensorization is widely applicable and establishes a practical foundation for private, interpretable, and effective clinical prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\uff08\u900f\u660e\u4f46\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff09\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff09\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u653b\u51fb\u6cc4\u9732\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u653b\u51fb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5f20\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff08TT\uff09\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u6df7\u6dc6\u53c2\u6570\uff1b3\uff09\u5728LORIS\uff08\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u514d\u75ab\u6cbb\u7597\u54cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548c\u6d45\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u90fd\u6cc4\u9732\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u767d\u76d2\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7279\u522b\u8106\u5f31\uff1b2\uff09\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\u5e38\u89c1\u5b9e\u8df5\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98ce\u9669\uff1b3\uff09\u5f20\u91cf\u5316\u9632\u5fa1\u5c06\u767d\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u968f\u673a\u731c\u6d4b\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b4\uff09\u5f20\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fb9\u9645\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f20\u91cf\u5316\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), as opposed to source code, have been shown to improve summarization quality in traditional encoder-decoder-based code summarization models. However, most large language model (LLM)-based code summarization methods rely on raw code or only incorporate partial AST signals, meaning that the potential of complete AST representation has not been fully explored for LLMs. This paper presents AST(NIT), an AST augmentation and serialization method that preserves lexical details and encodes structural information into LLM-compatible sequences. Experiments with the LLaMA-3.1-8B model on the CodeXGLUE Python dataset show that the proposed serialized ASTs reduce the length of LLM inputs, require shorter training times, and achieve summarization quality comparable to existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "AST(NIT)\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u5b8c\u6574AST\u6765\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6458\u8981\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u539f\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u6216\u90e8\u5206AST\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5b8c\u6574AST\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002AST\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5df2\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6458\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAST(NIT)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7AST\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ec6\u8282\u5e76\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u4e3aLLM\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u4f7f\u7528LLaMA-3.1-8B\u6a21\u578b\u5728CodeXGLUE Python\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u7684AST\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86LLM\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7f29\u77ed\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6458\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b8c\u6574AST\u8868\u793a\u5728LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0cAST(NIT)\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528AST\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Their random sparsity, however, is at odds with efficient implementations on modern GPUs, since it leads to irregular memory access patterns that degrade memory bandwidth utilization. Motivated by this tension, we pursue a sketch-kernel co-design approach: we design a new family of sparse sketches, BlockPerm-SJLT, whose sparsity structure is chosen to enable FlashSketch, a corresponding optimized CUDA kernel that implements these sketches efficiently. The design of BlockPerm-SJLT introduces a tunable parameter that explicitly trades off the tension between GPU-efficiency and sketching robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees for BlockPerm-SJLT under the oblivious subspace embedding (OSE) framework, and also analyze the effect of the tunable parameter on sketching quality. We empirically evaluate FlashSketch on standard RandNLA benchmarks, as well as an end-to-end ML data attribution pipeline called GraSS.

At each iteration, MoP generates two branches-pruning in depth versus pruning in width-and selects a candidate to advance the path. On LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3, MoP advances the frontier of structured pruning, exceeding the accuracy of competing methods across a broad set of compression regimes. It also consistently outperforms depth-only and width-only pruning. Furthermore, MoP translates structural pruning into real speedup, reducing end-to-end latency by 39% at 40% compression.

Automating this process is non-trivial because the information required for effective failure management is unstructured and cannot be automatically processed by traditional programs. With their ability to process unstructured data, large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results for automated failure management by previous work. Following these studies, we evaluated whether an LLM-based system could automate failure management in a CI/CD pipeline in the context of a large industrial software project, namely SAP HANA. We evaluated the ability of the LLM-based system to identify the error location and to propose exact solutions that contain no unnecessary actions. To support the LLM in generating exact solutions, we provided it with different types of domain knowledge, including pipeline information, failure management instructions, and data from historical failures. We conducted an ablation study to determine which type of domain knowledge contributed most to solution accuracy. The results show that data from historical failures contributed the most to the system's accuracy, enabling it to produce exact solutions in 92.1% of cases in our dataset. The system correctly identified the error location with 97.4% accuracy when provided with domain knowledge, compared to 84.2% accuracy without it.

This mismatch induces severe computation and I/O imbalance, exacerbates stragglers, and underutilizes GPU resources. We present PackInfer, a kernel-level attention framework that enables compute- and I/O-aware execution for heterogeneous batched inference. PackInfer orchestrates batched requests into load-balanced execution groups, effectively saturating GPU utilization by packing multiple requests into unified kernel launches. By constructing attention kernels directly over packed query-key regions, PackInfer eliminates redundant computation and balances thread-block execution. It then incorporates I/O-aware grouping that co-locates shared-prefix requests and reorganizes KV caches into group-contiguous layouts, reducing memory fragmentation and redundant data movement as generation evolves. Evaluations on real-world workloads show that PackInfer reduces inference latency by 13.0-20.1%, and improves throughput by 20% compared to the state-of-the-art FlashAttention.", "AI": {"tldr": "PackInfer\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u6279\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2dLLM\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u8981\u6279\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982FlashAttention\uff09\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u8bf7\u6c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u548cI/O\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001GPU\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e", "method": "1) \u5c06\u6279\u5904\u7406\u8bf7\u6c42\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u7684\u6267\u884c\u7ec4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u5185\u6838\u542f\u52a8\u6253\u5305\u591a\u4e2a\u8bf7\u6c42\uff1b2) \u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6253\u5305\u7684query-key\u533a\u57df\u6784\u5efa\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528I/O\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u5c06\u5171\u4eab\u524d\u7f00\u8bf7\u6c42\u5171\u7f6e\uff0c\u91cd\u7ec4KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4e3a\u7ec4\u8fde\u7eed\u5e03\u5c40", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684FlashAttention\uff0cPackInfer\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf13.0-20.1%\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf20%", "conclusion": "PackInfer\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u548cI/O\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6279\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2dLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u95ee\u9898"}}

While machine learning-based fault prediction models have demonstrated high accuracy, their lack of interpretability limits their adoption in industrial settings. Developers need actionable insights that can be directly employed in software quality assurance processes and guide defect mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present a structured process for defining context-specific software metric thresholds suitable for integration into fault detection workflows in industrial settings. Our approach supports cross-project fault prediction by deriving thresholds from one set of projects and applying them to independently developed firmware, thereby enabling reuse across similar software systems without retraining or domain-specific tuning. We analyze three real-world C-embedded firmware projects provided by an industrial partner, using Coverity and Understand static analysis tools to extract software metrics. Through statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, we identify discriminative metrics and derived empirical threshold values capable of distinguishing faulty from non-faulty functions. The derived thresholds are validated through an experimental evaluation, demonstrating their effectiveness in identifying fault-prone functions with high precision. The results confirm that the derived thresholds can serve as an interpretable solution for fault prediction, aligning with industry standards and SQA practices.

Among the different techniques used to improve web application performance, caching has been widely used. While caching has been widely explored in web performance optimization literature, there is a lack of experimental work that explores the effect of simple inmemory caching in small-scale web applications. This paper fills this research gap by experimentally comparing the performance of two server-side web application configurations: one without caching and another with in-memory caching and a fixed time-tolive. The performance evaluation was conducted using a lightweight web server framework, and response times were measured using repeated HTTP requests under identical environmental conditions. The results show a significant reduction in response time for cached requests, and the findings of this paper provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of simple server-side caching in improving web application performance making it suitable for educational environments and small-scale web applications where simplicity and reproducibility are critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u578bWeb\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u7f13\u5b58\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u7f13\u5b58\u6280\u672f\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578bWeb\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7b80\u5355\u5185\u5b58\u7f13\u5b58\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Web\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u590dHTTP\u8bf7\u6c42\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\uff1a\u65e0\u7f13\u5b58vs\u5e26\u56fa\u5b9a\u751f\u5b58\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u7f13\u5b58", "result": "\u7f13\u5b58\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7b80\u5355\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u7f13\u5b58\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347Web\u5e94\u7528\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u7f13\u5b58\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347Web\u5e94\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u5c0f\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u6027"}}

We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) $P_\u03b8(Y|X,Z)$ and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) $Q_\u03c6(Z|X,Y)$. SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling.

Existing automated repair methods typically rely on superficial pass/fail signals, offering limited visibility into program behavior and hindering precise error localization. In addition, without a way to learn from prior failures, repair processes often fall into repetitive and inefficient cycles. To overcome these challenges, we present TraceCoder, a collaborative multi-agent framework that emulates the observe-analyze-repair process of human experts. The framework first instruments the code with diagnostic probes to capture fine-grained runtime traces, enabling deep insight into its internal execution. It then conducts causal analysis on these traces to accurately identify the root cause of the failure. This process is further enhanced by a novel Historical Lesson Learning Mechanism (HLLM), which distills insights from prior failed repair attempts to inform subsequent correction strategies and prevent recurrence of similar mistakes. To ensure stable convergence, a Rollback Mechanism enforces that each repair iteration constitutes a strict improvement toward the correct solution. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that TraceCoder achieves up to a 34.43\\% relative improvement in Pass@1 accuracy over existing advanced baselines. Ablation studies verify the significance of each system component, with the iterative repair process alone contributing a 65.61\\% relative gain in accuracy.

Code available upon acceptance", "summary": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a compelling remedy for machine learning (ML) models that degrade under domain shifts, improving generalisation on-the-fly with only unlabelled samples. This flexibility suits real deployments, yet conventional evaluations unrealistically assume unbounded processing time, overlooking the accuracy-latency trade-off. As ML increasingly underpins latency-sensitive and user-facing use-cases, temporal pressure constrains the viability of adaptable inference; predictions arriving too late to act on are futile. We introduce Tempora, a framework for evaluating TTA under this pressure. It consists of temporal scenarios that model deployment constraints, evaluation protocols that operationalise measurement, and time-contingent utility metrics that quantify the accuracy-latency trade-off. We instantiate the framework with three such metrics: (1) discrete utility for asynchronous streams with hard deadlines, (2) continuous utility for interactive settings where value decays with latency, and (3) amortised utility for budget-constrained deployments. Applying Tempora to seven TTA methods on ImageNet-C across 240 temporal evaluations reveals rank instability: conventional rankings do not predict rankings under temporal pressure; ETA, a state-of-the-art method in the conventional setting, falls short in 41.2% of evaluations. The highest-utility method varies with corruption type and temporal pressure, with no clear winner. By enabling systematic evaluation across diverse temporal constraints for the first time, Tempora reveals when and why rankings invert, offering practitioners a lens for method selection and researchers a target for deployable adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Tempora\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94(TTA)\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6392\u540d\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4f1a\u53cd\u8f6c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709TTA\u8bc4\u4f30\u5047\u8bbe\u65e0\u9650\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u538b\u529b\u3002\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u5230\u8fbe\u592a\u665a\u5c31\u5931\u53bb\u4e86\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30TTA\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTempora\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1) \u65f6\u95f4\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b2) \u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\uff1b3) \u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6548\u7528\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e09\u79cd\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u79bb\u6563\u6548\u7528\uff08\u5f02\u6b65\u6d41\u786c\u622a\u6b62\uff09\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u6548\u7528\uff08\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8870\u51cf\uff09\u3001\u644a\u9500\u6548\u7528\uff08\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u90e8\u7f72\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet-C\u4e0a\u5bf97\u79cdTTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c240\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6392\u540d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1a\u4f20\u7edf\u6392\u540d\u65e0\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u6392\u540d\uff1bSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5ETA\u572841.2%\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u968f\u635f\u574f\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u538b\u529b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u8d62\u5bb6\u3002", "conclusion": "Tempora\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6392\u540d\u53cd\u8f6c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we propose Canzona, a Unified, Asynchronous, and Load-Balanced framework that decouples logical optimizer assignment from physical parameter distribution. For Data Parallelism, we introduce an alpha-Balanced Static Partitioning strategy that respects atomicity while neutralizing the load imbalance. For Tensor Parallelism, we design an Asynchronous Compute pipeline utilizing Micro-Group Scheduling to batch fragmented updates and hide reconstruction overhead.

To address a broader range of offline RL settings, we extend flow matching to a general framework that supports discrete action spaces with multiple objectives. Specifically, we replace continuous flows with continuous-time Markov chains, trained using a Q-weighted flow matching objective. We then extend our design to multi-agent settings, mitigating the exponential growth of joint action spaces via a factorized conditional path. We theoretically show that, under idealized conditions, optimizing this objective recovers the optimal policy. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that our method performs robustly in practical scenarios, including high-dimensional control, multi-modal decision-making, and dynamically changing preferences over multiple objectives.

Real-world malware binaries are typically stripped of symbols, contain large numbers of functions, and distribute malicious behavior across multiple code regions, making TTP attribution difficult. Recent large language models (LLMs) offer strong code understanding capabilities, but applying them directly to this task faces challenges in identifying analysis entry points, reasoning under partial observability, and misalignment with TTP-specific decision logic. We present TTPDetect, the first LLM agent for recognizing TTPs in stripped malware binaries. TTPDetect combines dense retrieval with LLM-based neural retrieval to narrow the space of analysis entry points. TTPDetect further employs a function-level analyzing agent consisting of a Context Explorer that performs on-demand, incremental context retrieval and a TTP-Specific Reasoning Guideline that achieves inference-time alignment. We build a new dataset that labels decompiled functions with TTPs across diverse malware families and platforms. TTPDetect achieves 93.25% precision and 93.81% recall on function-level TTP recognition, outperforming baselines by 10.38% and 18.78%, respectively. When evaluated on real world malware samples, TTPDetect recognizes TTPs with a precision of 87.37%.

Left open is uniqueness of the solution, and criteria for convergence outside of the standard tabular or linear MDP settings.\n  The present work extends these results to other variants of Q-learning, and clarifies prior work: a one dimensional example shows that under an oblivious policy for training there may be no solution to the PBE, or multiple solutions, and in each case the algorithm is not stable under oblivious training.\n  The main contribution is that far more structure is required for convergence. An example is presented for which the basis is ideal, in the sense that the true Q-function is in the span of the basis. However, there are two solutions to the PBE under the greedy policy, and hence also for the $(\\varepsilon,\u03ba)$-tamed Gibbs policy for all sufficiently small $\\varepsilon>0$ and $\u03ba\\ge 1$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Q-learning\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u975e\u8868\u683c\u6216\u7ebf\u6027MDP\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u57fa\u7840\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u6295\u5f71\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89e3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728(\u03b5,\u03ba)-\u9a6f\u670dGibbs\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684Q-learning\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u89e3\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u548c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u8868\u683c\u6216\u7ebf\u6027MDP\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6807\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7ef4\u793a\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5728\u65e0\u610f\u8bc6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u6295\u5f71\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u65b9\u7a0b\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u89e3\u6216\u591a\u89e3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u7840\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u60f3\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2aPBE\u89e3\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4f8b\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u771f\u5b9eQ\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u51fd\u6570\u5f20\u6210\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u6295\u5f71\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u65b9\u7a0b\u5728\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u6536\u655b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "Q-learning\u7684\u6536\u655b\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u8ba4\u8bc6\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u57fa\u7840\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u60f3\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u89e3\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches still operate at the function level, where models are asked to predict whether a single function is vulnerable without inter-procedural context. In practice, vulnerability presence and root cause often depend on contextual information. Naively appending such context is not a reliable solution: real-world context is long, redundant, and noisy, and we find that unstructured context frequently degrades the performance of strong fine-tuned code models.\n  We present CPRVul, a context-aware vulnerability detection framework that couples Context Profiling and Selection with Structured Reasoning. CPRVul constructs a code property graph, and extracts candidate context. It then uses an LLM to generate security-focused profiles and assign relevance scores, selecting only high-impact contextual elements that fit within the model's context window. In the second phase, CPRVul integrates the target function, the selected context, and auxiliary vulnerability metadata to generate reasoning traces, which are used to fine-tune LLMs for reasoning-based vulnerability detection.\n  We evaluate CPRVul on three high-quality vulnerability datasets: PrimeVul, TitanVul, and CleanVul. Across all datasets, CPRVul consistently outperforms function-only baselines, achieving accuracies ranging from 64.94% to 73.76%, compared to 56.65% to 63.68% for UniXcoder. Specifically, on the challenging PrimeVul benchmark, CPRVul achieves 67.78% accuracy, outperforming prior state-of-the-art approaches, improving accuracy from 55.17% to 67.78% (22.9% improvement).

Hence, the trade-off between accuracy and computation in an MoE model typically exhibits large discontinuities. We propose Mixture of Slimmable Experts (MoSE), an MoE architecture in which each expert has a nested, slimmable structure that can be executed at variable widths. This enables conditional computation not only over which experts are activated, but also over how much of each expert is utilized. Consequently, a single pretrained MoSE model can support a more continuous spectrum of accuracy-compute trade-offs at inference time. We present a simple and stable training recipe for slimmable experts under sparse routing, combining multi-width training with standard MoE objectives. During inference, we explore strategies for runtime width determination, including a lightweight test-time training mechanism that learns how to map router confidence/probabilities to expert widths under a fixed budget. Experiments on GPT models trained on OpenWebText demonstrate that MoSE matches or improves upon standard MoE at full width and consistently shifts the Pareto frontier for accuracy vs. cost, achieving comparable performance with significantly fewer FLOPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoSE\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u4f38\u7f29\u7ed3\u6784\u7684MoE\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6309\u4e0d\u540c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMoE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\u540e\u5b8c\u5168\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u53ef\u4f38\u7f29\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5177\u6709\u5d4c\u5957\u7684\u53ef\u4f38\u7f29\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5bbd\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6807\u51c6MoE\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5bbd\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u8def\u7531\u5668\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728OpenWebText\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684GPT\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cMoSE\u5728\u5168\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5339\u914d\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6MoE\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c11\u7684FLOPs\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MoSE\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u4f38\u7f29\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While ZeRO-3 succeeds on clusters with high-bandwidth NVLink and InfiniBand interconnects, researchers with commodity hardware face severe inter-node all-gather bottlenecks. Existing optimizations take two approaches: GPU memory caching (MiCS, ZeRO++) trades memory capacity for reduced communication, triggering out-of-memory failures on large models; host memory offloading (ZeRO-Offload, ZeRO-Infinity) extends capacity but degrades throughput due to PCIe overhead. We observe that on bandwidth-limited clusters, host memory can serve not as an overflow tier but as a fast caching layer that outperforms inter-node communication. Based on this insight, we propose FCDP, which eliminates redundant inter-node communication while preserving ZeRO-3's minimal GPU memory footprint. FCDP caches forward-pass parameters in host memory and reuses them during the backward pass via fast intra-node all-gather, reducing inter-node all-gather by 50%. For parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), FCDP selectively communicates only trainable parameters to maximize caching, reducing inter-node traffic by over 99%.

Cache-affinity scheduling, which co-locates requests with the same prompt prefix to maximize KV cache reuse, often conflicts with load-balancing scheduling that distributes requests evenly across compute instances. Existing schedulers fail to reconcile this trade-off as they operate within a single mapping space, typically applying cache-affinity routing to a subset of requests and load-balanced routing to the rest, without a unified solution to achieve both goals. To address this limitation, we propose DualMap, a dual-mapping scheduling strategy for distributed LLM serving that achieves both cache affinity and load balancing. Its key idea is to map each request to two candidate instances via two independent hash functions based on the request prompt, then intelligently select the better candidate based on current system states. This design increases the likelihood that requests with shared prefixes are co-located, while evenly dispersing distinct prefixes across the cluster via ``the power of two choices''. To make DualMap robust under dynamic and skewed real-world workloads, we incorporate three techniques: 1) SLO-aware request routing, which prioritizes cache affinity but switches to load-aware scheduling when TTFT exceeds the SLO, enhancing load balance without sacrificing cache reuse; 2) hotspot-aware rebalancing, which dynamically migrates requests from overloaded to underloaded instances, mitigating hotspots and rebalancing the system; 3) lightweight dual-hash-ring scaling, which leverages a dual-hash-ring mapping to support fast and low-overhead instance scaling without costly global remapping. Experiments on real-world workloads show that DualMap improves effective request capacity by up to 2.25$\\times$ under the same TTFT SLO constraints compared with SOTA work.", "AI": {"tldr": "DualMap\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u6620\u5c04\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\u5c06\u8bf7\u6c42\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5019\u9009\uff0c\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\u548c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728LLM\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8de8\u8bf7\u6c42\u91cd\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5bf9\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4eTTFT\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u6210\u672c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u7f13\u5b58\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\u8c03\u5ea6\uff08\u5c06\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u524d\u7f00\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42\u653e\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff09\u548c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u8c03\u5ea6\uff08\u5c06\u8bf7\u6c42\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u5230\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "1) \u53cc\u6620\u5c04\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bf7\u6c42\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5019\u9009\n2) SLO\u611f\u77e5\u8bf7\u6c42\u8def\u7531\uff1a\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u7f13\u5b58\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53TTFT\u8d85\u8fc7SLO\u65f6\u5207\u6362\u5230\u8d1f\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\n3) \u70ed\u70b9\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u5e73\u8861\uff1a\u52a8\u6001\u5c06\u8bf7\u6c42\u4ece\u8fc7\u8f7d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u6b20\u8f7d\u5b9e\u4f8b\n4) \u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53cc\u54c8\u5e0c\u73af\u6269\u5c55\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u54c8\u5e0c\u73af\u6620\u5c04\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6269\u5c55", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cDualMap\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684TTFT SLO\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u6709\u6548\u8bf7\u6c42\u5bb9\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u591a2.25\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "DualMap\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6620\u5c04\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7f13\u5b58\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\u4e0e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u503e\u659c\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u670d\u52a1\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002"}}

Early DNA encoders applied redundancy-heavy constraint layers atop raw binary data - workable but primitive. Recent neural codecs compress data into learned latent representations with rich statistical structure, yet still convert these latents to DNA via naive binary-to-quaternary transcoding, discarding the entropy model's optimization. This mismatch undermines compression efficiency and complicates the encoding stack. A plug-in module that collapses latent compression and DNA encoding into a single step. SCONE performs quaternary arithmetic coding directly on the latent space in DNA bases. Its Constraint-Aware Adaptive Coding module dynamically steers the entropy encoder's learned probability distribution to enforce biochemical constraints - Guanine-Cytosine (GC) balance and homopolymer suppression - deterministically during encoding, eliminating post-hoc correction.

The framework couples a reusable farm template with a Gymnasium-based monitoring and control layer that exposes queue, timing, and QoS metrics to both reactive and learning-based controllers. We investigate the effectiveness of AI-driven dynamic scaling for managing the farm's degree of parallelism via the scalability of serverless functions on OpenFaaS. In particular, we discuss the autoscaling model and its training, and evaluate two reinforcement learning (RL) policies against a baseline of reactive management derived from a simple farm performance model.

In the Transformer architecture, a large portion of these operations happens in the Feed Forward Network (FFN), and this portion increases for larger models, up to 50% of the total pretraining floating point operations. We show that we can leverage hardware-accelerated sparsity to accelerate all matrix multiplications in the FFN, with 2:4 sparsity for weights and v:n:m (Venom) sparsity for activations. Our recipe relies on sparse training steps to accelerate a large part of the pretraining, associated with regular dense training steps towards the end.

One way to be able to still show targeted ads, based on user personal and behavioral information, is to employ Federated Learning (FL), which performs distributed learning across users without sharing user raw data with other stakeholders in the publishing ecosystem. This paper presents AdFL, an FL framework that works in the browsers to learn user ad preferences. These preferences are aggregated in a global FL model, which is then used in the browsers to show more relevant ads to users. AdFL can work with any model that uses features available in the browser such as ad viewability, ad click-through, user dwell time on pages, and page content. The AdFL server runs at the publisher and coordinates the learning process for the users who browse pages on the publisher's website. The AdFL prototype does not require the client to install any software, as it is built utilizing standard APIs available on most modern browsers. We built a proof-of-concept model for ad viewability prediction that runs on top of AdFL. We tested AdFL and the model with two non-overlapping datasets from a website with 40K visitors per day. The experiments demonstrate AdFL's feasibility to capture the training information in the browser in a few milliseconds, show that the ad viewability prediction achieves up to 92.59% AUC, and indicate that utilizing differential privacy (DP) to safeguard local model parameters yields adequate performance, with only modest declines in comparison to the non-DP variant.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdFL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u6237\u5e7f\u544a\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5c55\u793a\u66f4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740GDPR\u7b49\u5728\u7ebf\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u51fa\u7248\u5546\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5b9a\u5411\u5e7f\u544a\u6536\u5165\u548c\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u5171\u4eab\u7528\u6237\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u5c55\u793a\u5b9a\u5411\u5e7f\u544a\u3002", "method": "AdFL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668API\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b89\u88c5\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4e2d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u5e7f\u544a\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u3001\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u3001\u9875\u9762\u505c\u7559\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u9875\u9762\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u53d1\u5e03\u8005\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u534f\u8c03\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eAdFL\u5728\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4e2d\u51e0\u6beb\u79d2\u5185\u5c31\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e7f\u544a\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u8fbe\u523092.59%\u7684AUC\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4ec5\u6bd4\u975e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7248\u672c\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u8db3\u591f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AdFL\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u544a\u504f\u597d\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u5b9a\u5411\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u51fa\u7248\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b26\u5408\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike centralized settings, the distributed nature of FL complicates the removal of individual data contributions. In this paper, we propose a novel federated unlearning framework formulated as a min-max optimization problem, where the objective is to maximize an $f$-divergence between the model trained with all data and the model retrained without specific data points, while minimizing the degradation on retained data. Our framework could act like a plugin and be added to almost any federated setup, unlike SOTA methods like (\\cite{10269017} which requires model degradation in server, or \\cite{khalil2025notfederatedunlearningweight} which requires to involve model architecture and model weights).

In such setup, isotropic feature distributions naturally arise as a mean to support well-structured and generalizable representations. In contrast, continual learning operates on streaming and non-stationary data, and trains models incrementally, inherently facing the well-known plasticity-stability dilemma. In such settings, learning dynamics tends to yield increasingly anisotropic feature space. This arises a fundamental question: should isotropy be enforced to achieve a better balance between stability and plasticity, and thereby mitigate catastrophic forgetting? In this paper, we investigate whether promoting feature-space isotropy can enhance representation quality in continual learning. Through experiments using contrastive continual learning techniques on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data, we find that isotropic regularization fails to improve, and can in fact degrade, model accuracy in continual settings. Our results highlight essential differences in feature geometry between centralized and continual learning, suggesting that isotropy, while beneficial in centralized setups, may not constitute an appropriate inductive bias for non-stationary learning scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u76f8\u53cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff09\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5e94\u8be5\u50cf\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u90a3\u6837\u5f3a\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cCIFAR-100\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0d\u4ec5\u672a\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u53cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u867d\u7136\u5728\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002"}}

While it induces a small memory footprint, its training dynamics can be surprisingly complex as they depend on several hyperparameters such as initialization, adapter rank, and learning rate. In particular, it is unclear how the optimal learning rate scales with adapter rank, which forces practitioners to re-tune the learning rate whenever the rank is changed. In this paper, we introduce Maximal-Update Adaptation ($\u03bc$A), a theoretical framework that characterizes how the \"optimal\" learning rate should scale with model width and adapter rank to produce stable, non-vanishing feature updates under standard configurations. $\u03bc$A is inspired from the Maximal-Update Parametrization ($\u03bc$P) in pretraining. Our analysis leverages techniques from hyperparameter transfer and reveals that the optimal learning rate exhibits different scaling patterns depending on initialization and LoRA scaling factor. Specifically, we identify two regimes: one where the optimal learning rate remains roughly invariant across ranks, and another where it scales inversely with rank. We further identify a configuration that allows learning rate transfer from LoRA to full finetuning, drastically reducing the cost of learning rate tuning for full finetuning. Experiments across language, vision, vision--language, image generation, and reinforcement learning tasks validate our scaling rules and show that learning rates tuned on LoRA transfer reliably to full finetuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u03bcA\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LoRA\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u968f\u79e9\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6216\u4e0e\u79e9\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5c06LoRA\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "LoRA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u4e2a\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u9002\u914d\u5668\u79e9\u53d8\u5316\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6bcf\u6b21\u6539\u53d8\u79e9\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8c03\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMaximal-Update Adaptation (\u03bcA)\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eMaximal-Update Parametrization (\u03bcP)\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8fc1\u79fb\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u9002\u914d\u5668\u79e9\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u968f\u79e9\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4e0e\u79e9\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\u3002\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u53ef\u5c06LoRA\u8c03\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u03bcA\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aLoRA\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4e0e\u79e9\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4eceLoRA\u5230\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

As such, the performance and security of the Ethereum blockchain are not only of theoretical interest, but also carry significant global economic implications. At the time of writing, the Ethereum platform is collectively secured by almost one million validators highlighting its decentralized nature and underlining its economic security guarantees. However, due to this large validator set, the protocol takes around 15 minutes to finalize a block which is prohibitively slow for many real world applications. This delay is largely driven by the cost of aggregating and disseminating signatures across a validator set of this scale. Furthermore, as we show in this paper, the existing protocol that is used to aggregate and disseminate the signatures has several shortcomings that can be exploited by adversaries to shift stake proportion from honest to adversarial nodes. In this paper, we introduce Wonderboom, the first million scale aggregation protocol that can efficiently aggregate the signatures of millions of validators in a single Ethereum slot (x32 faster) while offering higher security guarantees than the state of the art protocol used in Ethereum. Furthermore, to evaluate Wonderboom, we implement the first simulation tool that can simulate such a protocol on the million scale and show that even in the worst case Wonderboom can aggregate and verify more than 2 million signatures within a single Ethereum slot.", "AI": {"tldr": "Wonderboom\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u767e\u4e07\u7ea7\u7b7e\u540d\u805a\u5408\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u65f6\u9699\u5185\u9ad8\u6548\u805a\u5408\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u7b7e\u540d\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u5feb32\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u91cd\u8981\u91d1\u878d\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u62e5\u6709\u8fd1\u767e\u4e07\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u534f\u8bae\u9700\u8981\u7ea615\u5206\u949f\u624d\u80fd\u6700\u7ec8\u786e\u5b9a\u533a\u5757\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u7b7e\u540d\u805a\u5408\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u6210\u672c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u8bae\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5229\u7528\u6765\u8f6c\u79fb\u8d28\u62bc\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWonderboom\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u767e\u4e07\u7ea7\u805a\u5408\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u65f6\u9699\u5185\u9ad8\u6548\u805a\u5408\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u7b7e\u540d\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u767e\u4e07\u7ea7\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cWonderboom\u4e5f\u80fd\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u65f6\u9699\u5185\u805a\u5408\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8d85\u8fc7200\u4e07\u4e2a\u7b7e\u540d\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u8bae\u5feb32\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u534f\u8bae\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "Wonderboom\u534f\u8bae\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u7b7e\u540d\u805a\u5408\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u533a\u5757\u6700\u7ec8\u786e\u5b9a\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u534f\u8bae\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, current strategies for mapping these representations are inherently pairwise, scaling quadratically with the number of models and failing to yield a consistent global reference. In this paper, we study the alignment of $M \\ge 3$ models. We first adapt Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) to construct a shared orthogonal universe that preserves the internal geometry essential for tasks like model stitching. We then show that strict isometric alignment is suboptimal for retrieval, where agreement-maximizing methods like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) typically prevail. To bridge this gap, we finally propose Geometry-Corrected Procrustes Alignment (GCPA), which establishes a robust GPA-based universe followed by a post-hoc correction for directional mismatch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCPA consistently improves any-to-any retrieval while retaining a practical shared reference space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGCPA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u666e\u6c0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5171\u4eab\u53c2\u8003\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u6210\u5bf9\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5efa\u7acb\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u666e\u6c0f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u4e0eCCA\uff08\u6700\u5927\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52a3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u5e7f\u4e49\u666e\u6c0f\u5206\u6790\uff08GPA\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u6b63\u4ea4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u6821\u6b63\u666e\u6c0f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08GCPA\uff09\uff0c\u5728GPA\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u5411\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "GCPA\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u53c2\u8003\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GCPA\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Parallelizing the fixpoint engine can significantly reduce analysis times. Previous approaches typically fix the granularity of tasks upfront, e.g., at the level of program threads or procedures - yielding an engine permanently stuck in one gear. Instead, we propose to parallelize a generic fixpoint engine in a way that is parametric in the task granularity - meaning that our engine can be run in different gears. We build on the top-down solver TD, extended with support for mixed-flow sensitivity, and realize two competing philosophies for parallelization, both building on a task pool that schedules tasks to a fixed number of workers. The nature of tasks differs between the philosophies. In the immediate approach, all tasks access a single thread-safe hash table maintaining solver state, while in the independent approach, each task has its own state and exchanges data with other tasks via a publish/subscribe data structure.

To address this gap, this paper analyzes the learning dynamics of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) under gradient descent (GD). We demonstrate that the weight dynamics concentrate within invariant low-dimensional subspaces throughout training. Theoretically, we precisely characterize these invariant subspaces for two-layer networks with smooth nonlinear activations, providing insight into their emergence. Experimentally, we validate that this phenomenon extends beyond our theoretical assumptions. Leveraging these insights, we empirically show there exists a low-rank MLP parameterization that, when initialized within the appropriate subspaces, matches the classification performance of fully-parameterized counterparts on a variety of classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u52a8\u6001\u4f1a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u4f4e\u79e9\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7cbe\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u5177\u6709\u5e73\u6ed1\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e24\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6743\u91cd\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u79e9MLP\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f4e\u79e9\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The operational semantics of Concurrent (single-agent) GLP and of multiagent GLP (maGLP) were defined via transition systems/multiagent transition systems, respectively.\n  Here, we describe the mathematics developed to facilitate the workstation- and smartphone-based implementations of GLP by AI in Dart. We developed dGLP -- implementation-ready deterministic operational semantics for single-agent GLP -- and proved it correct with respect to the Concurrent GLP operational semantics; dGLP was used by AI as a formal spec, from which it developed a workstation-based implementation of GLP. We developed madGLP -- an implementation-ready multiagent operational semantics for maGLP -- and proved it correct with respect to the maGLP operational semantics; madGLP is deterministic at the agent level (not at the system level due to communication asynchrony), and is being used by AI as a formal spec from which it develops a smartphone-based implementation of maGLP.", "AI": {"tldr": "GLP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5e76\u53d1\u903b\u8f91\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8349\u6839\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bfb\u8005-\u5199\u8005\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u903b\u8f91\u548cfuture/promise\u8bed\u4e49\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c31\u7eea\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49dGLP\u548cmadGLP\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u5b9e\u73b0\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ad9\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u8349\u6839\u5e73\u53f0\uff08\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u901a\u4fe1\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c31\u7eea\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f7fAI\u80fd\u591f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ad9\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u5e73\u53f0\u7684GLP\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f00\u53d1dGLP\uff1a\u5355\u4ee3\u7406GLP\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e76\u53d1GLP\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff1b2. \u5f00\u53d1madGLP\uff1a\u591a\u4ee3\u7406GLP\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\uff08\u4ee3\u7406\u7ea7\u522b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8emaGLP\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86dGLP\u548cmadGLP\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c31\u7eea\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\uff0cdGLP\u5df2\u7528\u4e8eAI\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ad9GLP\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0cmadGLP\u6b63\u7528\u4e8eAI\u5f00\u53d1\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673amaGLP\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3aGLP\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e3aAI\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8349\u6839\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

This motivated our development of Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression Rule-Fit (SR4-Fit), a novel interpretable classification algorithm that addresses these limitations while maintaining superior classification performance. Using demographic characteristics of U.S. congressional districts from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, we demonstrate that SR4-Fit can predict House election party outcomes with unprecedented accuracy and interpretability. Our results show that while the majority party remains the strongest predictor, SR4-Fit has revealed intrinsic combinations of demographic factors that affect prediction outcomes that were unable to be interpreted in black-box algorithms such as random forests. The SR4-Fit algorithm surpasses both black-box models and existing interpretable rule-based algorithms such as RuleFit with respect to accuracy, simplicity, and robustness, generating stable and interpretable rule sets while maintaining superior predictive performance, thus addressing the traditional trade-off between model interpretability and predictive capability in electoral forecasting.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in using simplicial complexes rather than graphs, as models for multi-agent epistemic logic.\n  This approach uses agents' views as the fundamental object instead of worlds. A set of views by different agents about a world forms a simplex, and a set of simplexes defines a simplicial complex, that can serve as a model for multi-agent epistemic logic. This new approach reveals topological information that is implicit in Kripke models, because the binary indistinguishability relations are more clearly seen as n-ary relations in the simplicial complex.\n  This paper, written for an economics audience, introduces simplicial models to non-experts and connects distributed computing, epistemic logic and topology. Our focus is on distributed knowledge and its fixed point, common distributed knowledge. These concepts arise when considering the knowledge that a group of agents would acquire, if they could communicate their local knowledge perfectly. While common knowledge has been shown to be related to consensus, we illustrate how distributed knowledge is related to a task weaker to consensus, called majority consensus.\n  We describe three models of communication, some well-known (immediate snapshot), and others less studied (related to broadcast and test-and-set). When majority consensus is solvable, we describe the distributed knowledge that is used to solve it. When it is not solvable, we present a logical obstruction, a formula that should always be known according to the task specification, but which the players cannot know.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ca\u5176\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u2014\u2014\u516c\u5171\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6570\u5171\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\u57fa\u4e8e\u514b\u91cc\u666e\u514b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\u5173\u7cfb\u63cf\u8ff0\u53ef\u80fd\u4e16\u754c\u3002\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u63ed\u793a\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5411\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bfb\u8005\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fde\u63a5\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u516c\u5171\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4ee5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u800c\u975e\u4e16\u754c\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u96c6\u5408\u6784\u6210\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u96c6\u5408\u6784\u6210\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u79cd\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5373\u65f6\u5feb\u7167\u3001\u5e7f\u64ad\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6570\u5171\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u591a\u6570\u5171\u8bc6\u53ef\u89e3\u65f6\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u5f53\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u969c\u788d\u2014\u2014\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u8303\u5e94\u8be5\u59cb\u7ec8\u77e5\u9053\u4f46\u73a9\u5bb6\u65e0\u6cd5\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u3002\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u591a\u6570\u5171\u8bc6\uff08\u6bd4\u5171\u8bc6\u66f4\u5f31\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u800c\u516c\u5171\u77e5\u8bc6\u5219\u4e0e\u5171\u8bc6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u63ed\u793a\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u591a\u6570\u5171\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u516c\u5171\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u5171\u8bc6\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u64ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We introduce RuleSmith, the first framework that achieves automated game balancing by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of multi-agent LLMs. It couples a game engine, multi-agent LLMs self-play, and Bayesian optimization operating over a multi-dimensional rule space. As a proof of concept, we instantiate RuleSmith on CivMini, a simplified civilization-style game containing heterogeneous factions, economy systems, production rules, and combat mechanics, all governed by tunable parameters. LLM agents interpret textual rulebooks and game states to generate actions, to conduct fast evaluation of balance metrics such as win-rate disparities. To search the parameter landscape efficiently, we integrate Bayesian optimization with acquisition-based adaptive sampling and discrete projection: promising candidates receive more evaluation games for accurate assessment, while exploratory candidates receive fewer games for efficient exploration. Experiments show that RuleSmith converges to highly balanced configurations and provides interpretable rule adjustments that can be directly applied to downstream game systems. Our results illustrate that LLM simulation can serve as a powerful surrogate for automating design and balancing in complex multi-agent environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "RuleSmith\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6e38\u620f\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u5f15\u64ce\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u89c4\u5219\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u6e38\u620f\u5e73\u8861\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u73a9\u6cd5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u76f4\u89c9\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u6e38\u620f\u5e73\u8861\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6e38\u620f\u5f15\u64ce\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u3002LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89e3\u91ca\u6587\u672c\u89c4\u5219\u4e66\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u80dc\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u7b49\u5e73\u8861\u6307\u6807\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u83b7\u53d6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728CivMini\uff08\u7b80\u5316\u6587\u660e\u98ce\u683c\u6e38\u620f\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRuleSmith\u80fd\u591f\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6e38\u620f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89c4\u5219\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u590d\u6742\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6e38\u620f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u6e38\u620f\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a novel framework, ATEX-CF that unifies adversarial attack techniques with counterfactual explanation generation-a connection made feasible by their shared goal of flipping a node's prediction, yet differing in perturbation strategy: adversarial attacks often rely on edge additions, while counterfactual methods typically use deletions. Unlike traditional approaches that treat explanation and attack separately, our method efficiently integrates both edge additions and deletions, grounded in theory, leveraging adversarial insights to explore impactful counterfactuals. In addition, by jointly optimizing fidelity, sparsity, and plausibility under a constrained perturbation budget, our method produces instance-level explanations that are both informative and realistic. Experiments on synthetic and real-world node classification benchmarks demonstrate that ATEX-CF generates faithful, concise, and plausible explanations, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating adversarial insights into counterfactual reasoning for GNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "ATEX-CF\uff1a\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8fb9\u6dfb\u52a0\u548c\u5220\u9664\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fe0\u5b9e\u3001\u7b80\u6d01\u4e14\u5408\u7406\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u867d\u7136\u5171\u4eab\u7ffb\u8f6c\u8282\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u6270\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\uff08\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u901a\u5e38\u6dfb\u52a0\u8fb9\uff0c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5220\u9664\u8fb9\uff09\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6270\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faATEX-CF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u5c06\u8fb9\u6dfb\u52a0\u548c\u5220\u9664\u7edf\u4e00\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cATEX-CF\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5fe0\u5b9e\u3001\u7b80\u6d01\u4e14\u5408\u7406\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u6d1e\u5bdf\u6574\u5408\u5230\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u6280\u672f\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\uff0cATEX-CF\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

In this work we present the Laser Processing Fourier Neural Operator (LP-FNO), a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) based surrogate model that learns the parametric solution operator of various laser processes from multiphysics simulations generated with FLOW-3D WELD (registered trademark). Through a novel approach of reformulating the transient problem in the moving laser frame and applying temporal averaging, the system results in a quasi-steady state setting suitable for operator learning, even in the keyhole welding regime. The proposed LP-FNO maps process parameters to three-dimensional temperature fields and melt-pool boundaries across a broad process window spanning conduction and keyhole regimes using the non-dimensional normalized enthalpy formulation. The model achieves temperature prediction errors on the order of 1% and intersection-over-union scores for melt-pool segmentation over 0.9. We demonstrate that a LP-FNO model trained on coarse-resolution data can be evaluated on finer grids, yielding accurate super-resolved predictions in mesh-converged conduction regimes, whereas discrepancies in keyhole regimes reflect unresolved dynamics in the coarse-mesh training data. These results indicate that the LP-FNO provides an efficient surrogate modeling framework for laser welding, enabling prediction of full three-dimensional fields and phase interfaces over wide parameter ranges in just tens of milliseconds, up to a hundred thousand times faster than traditional Finite Volume multi-physics software.", "AI": {"tldr": "LP-FNO\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u6fc0\u5149\u710a\u63a5\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u52a8\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u548c\u65f6\u5747\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u5de5\u827a\u53c2\u6570\u5230\u4e09\u7ef4\u6e29\u5ea6\u573a\u548c\u7194\u6c60\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u7269\u7406\u573a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5feb10\u4e07\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6fc0\u5149\u710a\u63a5\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u827a\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u591a\u7269\u7406\u573a\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLP-FNO\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u77ac\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u6784\u5230\u79fb\u52a8\u6fc0\u5149\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u5747\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u51c6\u7a33\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7113\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4f20\u5bfc\u548c\u5319\u5b54\u710a\u63a5\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u827a\u53c2\u6570\u5230\u4e09\u7ef4\u6e29\u5ea6\u573a\u548c\u7194\u6c60\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea61%\uff0c\u7194\u6c60\u5206\u5272\u7684IoU\u5206\u6570\u8d85\u8fc70.9\uff1b\u5728\u7c97\u7f51\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5728\u7ec6\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u9884\u6d4b\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u591a\u7269\u7406\u573a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5feb10\u4e07\u500d\uff08\u4ec5\u9700\u6570\u5341\u6beb\u79d2\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LP-FNO\u4e3a\u6fc0\u5149\u710a\u63a5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5bbd\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5feb\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e09\u7ef4\u573a\u548c\u76f8\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u827a\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This problem corresponds to decomposing functions in the AND basis and is known as taking a M\u00f6bius transform. While the analogous problem for the parity basis (Fourier transform) $f: \\{-1,1 \\}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is well-understood, the AND basis presents a unique challenge: the basis vectors are coherent, precluding standard compressed sensing methods. We overcome this challenge by identifying that we can exploit adaptive group testing to provide a constructive, query-efficient implementation of the M\u00f6bius transform (also known as M\u00f6bius inversion) for sparse functions. We present two algorithms based on this insight. The Fully-Adaptive Sparse M\u00f6bius Transform (FASMT) uses $O(sd \\log(n/d))$ adaptive queries in $O((sd + n) sd \\log(n/d))$ time, which we show is near-optimal in query complexity. Furthermore, we also present the Partially-Adaptive Sparse M\u00f6bius Transform (PASMT), which uses $O(sd^2\\log(n/d))$ queries, trading a factor of $d$ to reduce the number of adaptive rounds to $O(d^2\\log(n/d))$, with no dependence on $s$.

However, the true efficacy of current unlearning methods remains uncertain. Standard evaluation metrics rely on benign queries that often mistake superficial information suppression for genuine knowledge removal. Such metrics fail to detect residual knowledge that more sophisticated prompting strategies could still extract. We introduce REBEL, an evolutionary approach for adversarial prompt generation designed to probe whether unlearned data can still be recovered. Our experiments demonstrate that REBEL successfully elicits ``forgotten'' knowledge from models that seemed to be forgotten in standard unlearning benchmarks, revealing that current unlearning methods may provide only a superficial layer of protection. We validate our framework on subsets of the TOFU and WMDP benchmarks, evaluating performance across a diverse suite of unlearning algorithms.

While steering efficacy has been widely studied, evaluations of whether interventions alter only the intended property remain limited, especially with respect to unintended changes in behaviors related to the target property. We call this notion specificity. We propose a framework that distinguishes three dimensions of specificity: general (preserving fluency and unrelated abilities), control (preserving related control properties), and robustness (preserving control properties under distribution shifts). We study two safety-critical use cases: steering models to reduce overrefusal and faithfulness hallucinations, and show that while steering achieves high efficacy and largely maintains general and control specificity, it consistently fails to preserve robustness specificity. In the case of overrefusal steering, for example, all steering methods reduce overrefusal without harming general abilities and refusal on harmful queries; however, they substantially increase vulnerability to jailbreaks. Our work provides the first systematic evaluation of specificity in model steering, showing that standard efficacy and specificity checks are insufficient, because without robustness evaluation, steering methods may appear reliable even when they compromise model safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u822c\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u63a7\u5236\u7279\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5f15\u5bfc\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5f15\u5bfc\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u6539\u53d8\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u4ed6\u76f8\u5173\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0d\u4f1a\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u4e00\u822c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff08\u4fdd\u6301\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u5173\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff08\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5173\u63a7\u5236\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff08\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u63a7\u5236\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\u3002\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7528\u4f8b\uff08\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u80fd\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u822c\u53ca\u63a7\u5236\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4e00\u81f4\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u867d\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u4e00\u822c\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5bf9\u6709\u5bb3\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5bf9\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u51c6\u6548\u80fd\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u770b\u4f3c\u53ef\u9760\u5374\u5b9e\u9645\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

For example, given a classifier that determines loan approval based on credit scores, applicants may open or close credit cards and bank accounts to obtain a positive prediction. The learning goal is to achieve low mistake or regret bounds despite such strategic behavior.\n  While randomized algorithms have the potential to offer advantages to the learner in strategic settings, they have been largely underexplored. In the realizable setting, no lower bound is known for randomized algorithms, and existing lower bound constructions for deterministic learners can be circumvented by randomization. In the agnostic setting, the best known regret upper bound is $O(T^{3/4}\\log^{1/4}T|\\mathcal H|)$, which is far from the standard online learning rate of $O(\\sqrt{T\\log|\\mathcal H|})$.\n  In this work, we provide refined bounds for online strategic classification in both settings.

Despite extensive work on safety post-training, it has been shown that models can be readily unaligned through post-deployment fine-tuning. However, these methods often require extensive data curation and degrade model utility.\n  In this work, we extend the practical limits of unalignment by introducing GRP-Obliteration (GRP-Oblit), a method that uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly remove safety constraints from target models. We show that a single unlabeled prompt is sufficient to reliably unalign safety-aligned models while largely preserving their utility, and that GRP-Oblit achieves stronger unalignment on average than existing state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, GRP-Oblit generalizes beyond language models and can also unalign diffusion-based image generation systems.\n  We evaluate GRP-Oblit on six utility benchmarks and five safety benchmarks across fifteen 7-20B parameter models, spanning instruct and reasoning models, as well as dense and MoE architectures.

These forms of regret are tightly connected to correlated equilibrium concepts in games, and have been more recently shown to guarantee non-manipulability against strategic adversaries. The only computationally efficient algorithm for minimizing linear swap regret over a general convex set in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ was developed recently by Daskalakis, Farina, Fishelson, Pipis, and Schneider (STOC '25). However, it incurs a highly suboptimal regret bound of $\u03a9(d^4 \\sqrt{T})$ and also relies on computationally intensive calls to the ellipsoid algorithm at each iteration.\n  In this paper, we develop a significantly simpler, computationally efficient algorithm that guarantees $O(d^{3/2} \\sqrt{T})$ linear swap regret for a general convex set and $O(d \\sqrt{T})$ when the set is centrally symmetric. Our approach leverages the powerful response-based approachability framework of Bernstein and Shimkin (JMLR '15) -- previously overlooked in the line of work on swap regret minimization -- combined with geometric preconditioning via the John ellipsoid. Our algorithm simultaneously minimizes profile swap regret, which was recently shown to guarantee non-manipulability. Moreover, we establish a matching information-theoretic lower bound: any learner must incur in expectation $\u03a9(d \\sqrt{T})$ linear swap regret for large enough $T$, even when the set is centrally symmetric. This also shows that the classic algorithm of Gordon, Greenwald, and Marks (ICML '08) is existentially optimal for minimizing linear swap regret, although it is computationally inefficient. Finally, we extend our approach to minimize regret with respect to the set of swap deviations with polynomial dimension, unifying and strengthening recent results in equilibrium computation and online learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7ebf\u6027\u4ea4\u6362\u9057\u61be\u4ece\u03a9(d\u2074\u221aT)\u964d\u81f3O(d\u00b3/\u00b2\u221aT)\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5bf9\u79f0\u96c6\u8fbeO(d\u221aT)\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5339\u914d\u4e0b\u754c\u03a9(d\u221aT)", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7ebf\u6027\u4ea4\u6362\u9057\u61be\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff08\u03a9(d\u2074\u221aT)\uff09\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u692d\u7403\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Bernstein-Shimkin\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u53ef\u63a5\u8fd1\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u4e0eJohn\u692d\u7403\u51e0\u4f55\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8f6e\u5ed3\u4ea4\u6362\u9057\u61be", "result": "\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06\u9057\u61be\u964d\u81f3O(d\u00b3/\u00b2\u221aT)\uff0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5bf9\u79f0\u96c6\u4e3aO(d\u221aT)\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5339\u914d\u4e0b\u754c\u03a9(d\u221aT)\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ea4\u6362\u504f\u5dee", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u7b80\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5e76\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e86\u5747\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u7ed3\u679c"}}

We design the method to be deterministic to ensure reliable test accuracy and to prevent the degradation of effective robustness observed in stochastic purification approaches when the adversary has full knowledge of the system and its randomness. We employ a score model trained by minimizing the expected reconstruction error of noise-corrupted data, thereby learning the structural characteristics of the input data distribution. Given a potentially adversarial input, the method searches within its local neighborhood for a purified sample that minimizes the expected reconstruction error under noise corruption and then feeds this purified sample to the classifier. During purification, sharpness-aware minimization is used to guide the purified samples toward flat regions of the expected reconstruction error landscape, thereby enhancing robustness. We further show that, as the noise level decreases, minimizing the expected reconstruction error biases the purified sample toward local maximizers of the Gaussian-smoothed density; under additional local assumptions on the score model, we prove recovery of a local maximizer in the small-noise limit.

Motivated by privacy-preserving browser APIs and the deprecation of third-party cookies, we study a setting where the learner observes a sequence of clicks and a sequence of conversions, but can only link a conversion to a set of candidate clicks (an attribution set) rather than a unique source. We formalize this as learning from attribution sets generated by an oblivious adversary equipped with a prior distribution over the candidates. Despite the lack of explicit labels, we construct an unbiased estimator of the population loss from these coarse signals via a novel approach. Leveraging this estimator, we show that Empirical Risk Minimization achieves generalization guarantees that scale with the informativeness of the prior and is also robust against estimation errors in the prior, despite complex dependencies among attribution sets. Simple empirical evaluations on standard datasets suggest our unbiased approach significantly outperforms common industry heuristics, particularly in regimes where attribution sets are large or overlapping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u96c6\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e7f\u544a\u8f6c\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u660e\u786e\u7684\u70b9\u51fb-\u8f6c\u5316\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668API\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9Cookie\u5f03\u7528\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e7f\u544a\u70b9\u51fb\u4e0e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u76f4\u63a5\u94fe\u63a5\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u53ea\u80fd\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u70b9\u51fb\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u8f6c\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u4e14\u53ea\u80fd\u5c06\u8f6c\u5316\u5173\u8054\u5230\u5019\u9009\u70b9\u51fb\u96c6\u5408\u800c\u975e\u552f\u4e00\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u5f52\u56e0\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u603b\u4f53\u635f\u5931\u7684\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e5f\u80fd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5f52\u56e0\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cdb\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0e\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u5148\u9a8c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f52\u56e0\u96c6\u5408\u8f83\u5927\u6216\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18", "conclusion": "\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u56e0\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6c\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e7f\u544a\u9886\u57df\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Sparse attention reduces this cost by restricting computation to a subset of tokens, but its effectiveness depends critically on efficient scoring and selection of relevant tokens at inference time. We revisit Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) as a sparsification primitive and introduce SOCKET, a SOft Collision Kernel EsTimator that replaces hard bucket matches with probabilistic, similarity-aware aggregation. Our key insight is that hard LSH produces discrete collision signals and is therefore poorly suited for ranking. In contrast, soft LSH aggregates graded collision evidence across hash tables, preserving the stability of relative ordering among the true top-$k$ tokens. This transformation elevates LSH from a candidate-generation heuristic to a principled and mathematically grounded scoring kernel for sparse attention. Leveraging this property, SOCKET enables efficient token selection without ad-hoc voting mechanism, and matches or surpasses established sparse attention baselines across multiple long-context benchmarks using diverse set of models. With a custom CUDA kernel for scoring keys and a Flash Decode Triton backend for sparse attention, SOCKET achieves up to 1.5$\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention, making it an effective tool for long-context inference.

Such uncertainty is typically assessed using ensembles produced with physics based climate models. However, computational constraints impose a trade off between generating the large ensembles required for robust uncertainty estimation and increasing model resolution to better capture fine scale dynamics. Generative machine learning offers a promising pathway to alleviate these constraints. We develop a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE) trained on a limited sample of climate simulations to generate arbitrary large ensembles. The approach is applied to output from monthly CMIP6 historical and future scenario experiments produced with the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis' (CCCma's) Earth system model CanESM5. We show that the cVAE model learns the underlying distribution of the data and generates physically consistent samples that reproduce realistic low and high moment statistics, including extremes. Compared with more sophisticated generative architectures, cVAEs offer a mathematically transparent, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework. Their simplicity lead to some limitations, such as overly smooth outputs, spectral bias, and underdispersion, that we discuss along with strategies to mitigate them. Specifically, we show that incorporating output noise improves the representation of climate relevant multiscale variability, and we propose a simple method to achieve this. Finally, we show that cVAE-enhanced ensembles capture realistic global teleconnection patterns, even under climate conditions absent from the training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(cVAE)\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u62df\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u610f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u5185\u90e8\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u7387\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u96be\uff1a\u8981\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u96c6\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5065\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c31\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6355\u6349\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(cVAE)\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684CMIP6\u5386\u53f2\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u60c5\u666f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u5e95\u5c42\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u62df\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "result": "cVAE\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u91cd\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4f4e\u9636\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff09\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5168\u7403\u9065\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u672a\u5305\u542b\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u6761\u4ef6\u4e5f\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "cVAE\u4e3a\u6c14\u5019\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Through empirical analysis of trained language models, we find that attention mass concentrates on a distinct topological manifold -- and this manifold can be identified dynamically without checking every position. We prove a general result: for any query, projecting attention onto the Condensate Manifold (Anchor + Window + Dynamic Top-k) achieves 100% output equivalence with full $O(n^2)$ attention.

The mechanistic structure helps keep trajectories epidemiologically plausible, while neural components can capture non-stationary, data-adaptive effects. In practice, however, many seemingly straightforward couplings fail under partial observability and continually shifting transmission dynamics driven by behavior, waning immunity, seasonality, and interventions. We catalog these failure modes and show that robust performance requires making non-stationarity explicit: we extract multi-scale structure from the observed infection series and use it as an interpretable control signal for a controlled neural ODE coupled to an epidemiological model. Concretely, we decompose infections into trend, seasonal, and residual components and use these signals to drive continuous-time latent dynamics while jointly forecasting and inferring time-varying transmission, recovery, and immunity-loss rates. Across seasonal and non-seasonal settings, including early outbreaks and multi-wave regimes, our approach reduces long-horizon RMSE by 15-35%, improves peak timing error by 1-3 weeks, and lowers peak magnitude bias by up to 30% relative to strong time-series, neural ODE, and hybrid baselines, without relying on auxiliary covariates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u673a\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecfODE\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u514d\u75ab\u8870\u51cf\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff09\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u5931\u8d25", "method": "\u4ece\u611f\u67d3\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u3001\u6b8b\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a71\u52a8\u53d7\u63a7\u795e\u7ecfODE\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u53d8\u4f20\u64ad\u7387\u3001\u6062\u590d\u7387\u548c\u514d\u75ab\u635f\u5931\u7387", "result": "\u5728\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4bRMSE\u964d\u4f4e15-35%\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c\u65f6\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u6539\u55841-3\u5468\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c\u5e45\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe30%", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6df7\u5408\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027"}}

While Domain Randomization (DR) and meta-RL have been proposed to address this issue, they typically rely on extensive pretraining, privileged information, or high computational cost, limiting their applicability to real-time and edge systems. In this paper, we propose a lightweight online adaptation framework for RL based on Reservoir Computing. Specifically, we integrate an Echo State Networks (ESNs) as an adaptation module that encodes recent observation histories into a latent context representation, and update its readout weights online using Recursive Least Squares (RLS). This design enables rapid adaptation without backpropagation, pretraining, or access to privileged information. We evaluate the proposed method on CartPole and HalfCheetah tasks with severe and abrupt environment changes, including periodic external disturbances and extreme friction variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms DR and representative adaptive baselines under out-of-distribution dynamics, achieving stable adaptation within a few control steps. Notably, the method successfully handles intra-episode environment changes without resetting the policy.

However, this objective encounters a fundamental geometric contradiction: current OOD detectors rely on a static and compact data manifold, whereas traditional classification-oriented unlearning methods disrupt this delicate structure, leading to a catastrophic loss of the model's capability to discriminate anomalies while erasing target classes. To resolve this dilemma, we first define the problem of boundary-preserving class unlearning and propose a pivotal conceptual shift: in the context of OOD detection, effective unlearning is mathematically equivalent to transforming the target class into OOD samples. Based on this, we propose the TFER (Total Free Energy Repulsion) framework. Inspired by the free energy principle, TFER constructs a novel Push-Pull game mechanism: it anchors retained classes within a low-energy ID manifold through a pull mechanism, while actively expelling forgotten classes to high-energy OOD regions using a free energy repulsion force. This approach is implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, circumventing the prohibitive cost of full retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TFER achieves precise unlearning while maximally preserving the model's discriminative performance on remaining classes and external OOD data. More importantly, our study reveals that the unique Push-Pull equilibrium of TFER endows the model with inherent structural stability, allowing it to effectively resist catastrophic forgetting without complex additional constraints, thereby demonstrating exceptional potential in continual unlearning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "TFER\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u6392\u65a5\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fb9\u754c\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aOOD\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301ID\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u5fd8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u9762\u4e34\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u5927\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u5fd8\u6ee1\u8db3\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u77db\u76fe\uff1aOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u4e27\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTFER\uff08\u603b\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u6392\u65a5\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u539f\u7406\u6784\u5efa\u63a8\u62c9\u6e38\u620f\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u62c9\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u4fdd\u7559\u7c7b\u522b\u951a\u5b9a\u5728\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cfID\u6d41\u5f62\u5185\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u6392\u65a5\u529b\u4e3b\u52a8\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u7c7b\u522b\u63a8\u81f3\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cfOOD\u533a\u57df\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTFER\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5269\u4f59\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u5916\u90e8OOD\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0cTFER\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u63a8\u62c9\u5e73\u8861\u8d4b\u4e88\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u6297\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TFER\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u7c7b\u522b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aOOD\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u5fd8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7279\u6027\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While significant progress has been made in minimizing external regret in the self-play settings or with full-information feedback, real-world applications often force learners to play against unknown, arbitrary opponents and restrict learners to bandit feedback where only the payoff of the realized action is observable. In such challenging settings, it is well-known that $\u03a9(\\sqrt{T})$ external regret is unavoidable (where T is the number of rounds). To overcome this barrier, we investigate adversarial learning in zero-sum games under bandit feedback, aiming to minimize the deficit against the maximin pure strategy -- a metric we term Pure-Strategy Maximin Regret.\n  We analyze this problem under two bandit feedback models: uninformed (only the realized reward is revealed) and informed (both the reward and the opponent's action are revealed). For uninformed bandit learning of normal-form games, we show that the Tsallis-INF algorithm achieves $O(c \\log T)$ instance-dependent regret with a game-dependent parameter $c$. Crucially, we prove an information-theoretic lower bound showing that the dependence on c is necessary. To overcome this hardness, we turn to the informed setting and introduce Maximin-UCB, which obtains another regret bound of the form $O(c' \\log T)$ for a different game-dependent parameter $c'$ that could potentially be much smaller than $c$. Finally, we generalize both results to bilinear games over an arbitrary, large action set, proposing Tsallis-FTRL-SPM and Maximin-LinUCB for the uninformed and informed setting respectively and establishing similar game-dependent logarithmic regret bounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u5728\u5f3a\u76d7\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u540e\u6094\u754c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u9700\u8981\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u5bf9\u624b\u4e14\u53ea\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u5f3a\u76d7\u53cd\u9988\uff08\u4ec5\u80fd\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u6240\u9009\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u6536\u76ca\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u03a9(\u221aT)\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u540e\u6094\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236", "method": "1. \u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u5f3a\u76d7\u53cd\u9988\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528Tsallis-INF\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u5f3a\u76d7\u53cd\u9988\uff1a\u63d0\u51faMaximin-UCB\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b3. \u6269\u5c55\u5230\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u535a\u5f08\uff1a\u63d0\u51faTsallis-FTRL-SPM\uff08\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u548cMaximin-LinUCB\uff08\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5", "result": "1. \u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1aTsallis-INF\u5b9e\u73b0O(c log T)\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4f9d\u8d56\u540e\u6094\u754c\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9c\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff1b2. \u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1aMaximin-UCB\u5b9e\u73b0O(c' log T)\u540e\u6094\u754c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dc'\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8ec\uff1b3. \u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u535a\u5f08\u6269\u5c55\uff1a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u540e\u6094\u754c", "conclusion": "\u5728\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u5f3a\u76d7\u53cd\u9988\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u7a81\u7834\u03a9(\u221aT)\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e38\u620f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u540e\u6094\u754c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd"}}

To achieve this, a crucial task during learning is to leverage the correlation among labels. Deep Forest (DF) is a deep learning framework based on tree ensembles, whose training phase does not rely on backpropagation. DF performs in-model feature transform using the prediction of each layer and achieves competitive performance on many tasks. However, its exploration in the field of LDL is still in its infancy. The few existing methods that apply DF to the field of LDL do not have effective ways to utilize the correlation among labels. Therefore, we propose a method named Enhanced and Reused Feature Deep Forest (ERDF). It mainly contains two mechanisms: feature enhancement exploiting label correlation and measure-aware feature reuse. The first one is to utilize the correlation among labels to enhance the original features, enabling the samples to acquire more comprehensive information for the task of LDL. The second one performs a reuse operation on the features of samples that perform worse than the previous layer on the validation set, in order to ensure the stability of the training process. This kind of Enhance-Reuse pattern not only enables samples to enrich their features but also validates the effectiveness of their new features and conducts a reuse process to prevent the noise from spreading further.

But how well do such LLM-generated distributions support downstream decision-making? For example, when pricing a new product, a firm could prompt an LLM to simulate how much consumers are willing to pay based on a product description, but how useful is the resulting distribution for optimizing the price? We refer to this approach as LLM-SAA, in which an LLM is used to construct an estimated distribution and the decision is then optimized under that distribution. In this paper, we study metrics to evaluate the quality of these LLM-generated distributions, based on the decisions they induce. Taking three canonical decision-making problems (assortment optimization, pricing, and newsvendor) as examples, we find that LLM-generated distributions are practically useful, especially in low-data regimes. We also show that decision-agnostic metrics such as Wasserstein distance can be misleading when evaluating these distributions for decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u51b3\u7b56\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u8bef\u5bfc\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u5982\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u652f\u4ed8\u610f\u613f\u6a21\u62df\uff09\u5728\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u51b3\u7b56\uff08\u5982\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u65f6\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLM-SAA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u6784\u5efa\u4f30\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u8be5\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u54c1\u7c7b\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u3001\u62a5\u7ae5\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u5e03\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u51b3\u7b56\u5bfc\u5411\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5e03\u8ddd\u79bb\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u51b3\u7b56\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6548\u7528\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u51b3\u7b56\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6307\u6807\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5e03\u8ddd\u79bb\u6307\u6807\uff0cLLM-SAA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u80fd\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Existing remedies face a dichotomy: gradient surgery methods offer geometric safety but incur prohibitive computational costs via online projections, while efficient data selection approaches reduce overhead but remain blind to conflict-inducing gradient directions. In this paper, we propose Orthogonal Gradient Selection (OGS), a data-centric method that harmonizes domain performance, general capability retention, and training efficiency. OGS shifts the geometric insights of gradient projection from the optimizer to the data selection stage by treating data selection as a constrained decision-making process. By leveraging a lightweight Navigator model and reinforcement learning techniques, OGS dynamically identifies training samples whose gradients are orthogonal to a general-knowledge anchor. This approach ensures naturally safe updates for target models without modifying the optimizer or incurring runtime projection costs. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial domains demonstrate that OGS achieves excellent results, significantly improving domain performance and training efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing performance on general tasks such as GSM8K.", "AI": {"tldr": "OGS\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u83b7\u5f97\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f1a\u4e27\u5931\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff08\u68af\u5ea6\u624b\u672f\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u51b2\u7a81\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\uff08\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u6b63\u4ea4\u68af\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\uff08OGS\uff09\uff1a\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6d1e\u5bdf\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5bfc\u822a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u951a\u70b9\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOGS\u5728\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728GSM8K\u7b49\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "OGS\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6216\u589e\u52a0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6295\u5f71\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

They often perform well in large language model (LLM) training, but their dynamics remain poorly understood. In the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) setting, where weight updates are parameterized as a product of two low-rank factors, we find a distinctive spectral phenomenon under Muon in LoRA fine-tuning of LLMs: singular values of the LoRA product show near-uniform growth across the spectrum, despite orthogonalization being performed on the two factors separately. Motivated by this observation, we analyze spectral gradient flow (SpecGF)-a continuous-time analogue of SpecGD-in a simplified LoRA-style matrix factorization setting and prove \"equal-rate\" dynamics: all singular values grow at equal rates up to small deviations. Consequently, smaller singular values attain their target values earlier than larger ones, sharply contrasting with the largest-first stepwise learning observed in standard gradient flow. Moreover, we prove that SpecGF in our setting converges to global minima from almost all initializations, provided the factor norms remain bounded; with $\\ell_2$ regularization, we obtain global convergence.

We study a simple, model agnostic post processing framework that can be applied on top of any synthetic data generator to improve this trade off. First, a mode patching step repairs categories that are missing or severely underrepresented in the synthetic data, while largely preserving learned dependencies. Second, a k nearest neighbor filter replaces synthetic records that lie too close to real data points, enforcing a minimum distance between real and synthetic samples. We instantiate this framework for two neural generative models for tabular data, a feed forward generator and a variational autoencoder, and evaluate it on three public datasets covering credit card transactions, cardiovascular health, and census based income. We assess marginal and joint distributional similarity, the performance of models trained on synthetic data and evaluated on real data, and several empirical privacy indicators, including nearest neighbor distances and attribute inference attacks. With moderate thresholds between 0.2 and 0.35, the post processing reduces divergence between real and synthetic categorical distributions by up to 36 percent and improves a combined measure of pairwise dependence preservation by 10 to 14 percent, while keeping downstream predictive performance within about 1 percent of the unprocessed baseline. At the same time, distance based privacy indicators improve and the success rate of attribute inference attacks remains largely unchanged.

This study investigates whether hybrid deep learning architectures that integrate convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based components can improve emotion classification performance and robustness in EEG data. We propose an enhanced hybrid model that combines convolutional feature extraction, bidirectional temporal modeling, and self-attention mechanisms with regularization strategies to mitigate overfitting. Experiments conducted on a publicly available EEG dataset spanning three emotional states (neutral, positive, and negative) demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance, significantly outperforming classical machine learning and neural baselines. Statistical tests confirm the robustness of these performance gains under cross-validation. Feature-level analyses further reveal that covariance-based EEG features contribute most strongly to emotion discrimination, highlighting the importance of inter-channel relationships in affective modeling.

Existing protein structure tokenizers create tokens by pooling information from local neighborhoods, an approach that limits their performance on generative and representation tasks. In this work, we present a method for global tokenization of protein structures in which successive tokens contribute increasing levels of detail to a global representation. This change resolves several issues with generative models based on local protein tokenization: it mitigates error accumulation, provides embeddings without sequence-reduction operations, and allows task-specific adaptation of a tokenized sequence's information content. We validate our method on reconstruction, generative, and representation tasks and demonstrate that it matches or outperforms existing models based on local protein structure tokenizers.

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of OSS contributor networks using advanced graph neural networks and temporal network analysis on data spanning 25 years from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ecosystem, encompassing sandbox, incubating, and graduated projects. Our analysis of thousands of contributors across hundreds of repositories reveals that OSS networks exhibit strong power-law distributions in influence, with the top 1\\% of contributors controlling a substantial portion of network influence. Using GPU-accelerated PageRank, betweenness centrality, and custom LSTM models, we identify five distinct contributor roles: Core, Bridge, Connector, Regular, and Peripheral, each with unique network positions and structural importance. Statistical analysis reveals significant correlations between specific action types (commits, pull requests, issues) and contributor influence, with multiple regression models explaining substantial variance in influence metrics. Temporal analysis shows that network density, clustering coefficients, and modularity exhibit statistically significant temporal trends, with distinct regime changes coinciding with major project milestones. Structural integrity simulations show that Bridge contributors, despite representing a small fraction of the network, have a disproportionate impact on network cohesion when removed.

Most gradient-based parameter estimation methods rely on finite-difference approximations or automatic differentiation frameworks (e.g., JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow), which are computationally demanding and introduce truncation errors, solver instabilities, and substantial overhead. These limitations are particularly acute for the ODE systems of conceptual watershed models. Here we introduce a fully analytic and computationally efficient framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling based on exact parameter sensitivities. By augmenting the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations, we jointly evolve the model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters. This Jacobian then provides fully analytic gradient vectors for any differentiable loss function. These include classical objective functions such as the sum of absolute and squared residuals, widely used hydrologic performance metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, robust loss functions that down-weight extreme events, and hydrograph-based functionals such as flow-duration and recession curves. The analytic sensitivities eliminate the step-size dependence and noise inherent to numerical differentiation, while avoiding the instability of adjoint methods and the overhead of modern machine-learning autodiff toolchains. The resulting gradients are deterministic, physically interpretable, and straightforward to embed in gradient-based optimizers. Overall, this work enables rapid, stable, and transparent gradient-based calibration of conceptual hydrologic models, unlocking the full potential of differentiable modeling without reliance on external, opaque, or CPU-intensive automatic-differentiation libraries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u5168\u89e3\u6790\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6c34\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5e7f\u63a7\u5236ODE\u7cfb\u7edf\u8054\u5408\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4e3a\u5404\u79cd\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u900f\u660e\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u6c34\u6587\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u901a\u5e38\u7f13\u6162\u4e14\u6570\u503c\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6216\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u622a\u65ad\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u6d41\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u7684ODE\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5e7f\u63a7\u5236ODE\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u654f\u611f\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6240\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u8be5\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u4e3a\u4efb\u4f55\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ecf\u5178\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u6c34\u6587\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c34\u6587\u56fe\u7684\u6cdb\u51fd\u3002", "result": "\u89e3\u6790\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u6b65\u957f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f34\u968f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u3001\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u6c34\u6587\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u900f\u660e\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u91ca\u653e\u4e86\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5168\u90e8\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u3001\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6216CPU\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u5e93\u3002"}}

Memorize to Forget for Machine Unlearning", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "For ethical and safe AI, machine unlearning rises as a critical topic aiming to protect sensitive, private, and copyrighted knowledge from misuse. To achieve this goal, it is common to conduct gradient ascent (GA) to reverse the training on undesired data. However, such a reversal is prone to catastrophic collapse, which leads to serious performance degradation in general tasks. As a solution, we propose model extrapolation as an alternative to GA, which reaches the counterpart direction in the hypothesis space from one model given another reference model. Therefore, we leverage the original model as the reference, further train it to memorize undesired data while keeping prediction consistency on the rest retained data, to obtain a memorization model. Counterfactual as it might sound, a forget model can be obtained via extrapolation from the memorization model to the reference model. Hence, we avoid directly acquiring the forget model using GA, but proceed with gradient descent for the memorization model, which successfully stabilizes the machine unlearning process. Our model extrapolation is simple and efficient to implement, and it can also effectively converge throughout training to achieve improved unlearning performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5916\u63a8\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5916\u63a8\u83b7\u5f97\u9057\u5fd8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5d29\u6e83", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4fdd\u62a4\u654f\u611f\u3001\u79c1\u4eba\u548c\u53d7\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5916\u63a8\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4ee5\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u4f4f\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff1b2) \u4ece\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u5916\u63a8\u83b7\u5f97\u9057\u5fd8\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3) \u907f\u514d\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u6539\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5916\u63a8\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6536\u655b\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u9057\u5fd8\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5916\u63a8\u6cd5\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898"}}

We present PiEvo, a principle-evolvable framework that treats scientific discovery as Bayesian optimization over an expanding principle space. By integrating Information-Directed Hypothesis Selection via Gaussian Process and an anomaly-driven augmentation mechanism, PiEvo enables agents to autonomously refine their theoretical worldview. Evaluation across four benchmarks demonstrates that PiEvo (1) achieves an average solution quality of up to 90.81%~93.15%, representing a 29.7%~31.1% improvement over the state-of-the-art, (2) attains an 83.3% speedup in convergence step via significantly reduced sample complexity by optimizing the compact principle space, and (3) maintains robust performance across diverse scientific domains and LLM backbones.", "AI": {"tldr": "PiEvo\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u539f\u5219\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8ba9LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u6f14\u5316\u79d1\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u9896\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u5e38\u56fa\u5b88\u521d\u59cb\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u9759\u6001\u5047\u8bbe\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u7406\u8bba\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u641c\u7d22\u5047\u8bbe\u8f6c\u5411\u6f14\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u79d1\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPiEvo\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u4e3a\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u539f\u5219\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bfc\u5411\u5047\u8bbe\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u9a71\u52a8\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cbe\u70bc\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff1a1) \u5e73\u5747\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u8fbe90.81%~93.15%\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534729.7%~31.1%\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7d27\u51d1\u539f\u5219\u7a7a\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b083.3%\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6b65\u6570\u52a0\u901f\uff1b3) \u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u548cLLM\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PiEvo\u901a\u8fc7\u6f14\u5316\u79d1\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u79d1\u5b66\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

A common strategy is to directly bind different modalities together in a specific joint embedding space. However, the capability of existing methods is restricted within the modalities presented in the given dataset, thus they are biased when generalizing to unpresented modalities in downstream tasks. As a result, due to such inflexibility, the viability of previous methods is seriously hindered by the cost of acquiring multi-modal datasets. In this paper, we introduce BrokenBind, which focuses on binding modalities that are presented from different datasets. To achieve this, BrokenBind simultaneously leverages multiple datasets containing the modalities of interest and one shared modality. Though the two datasets do not correspond to each other due to distribution mismatch, we can capture their relationship to generate pseudo embeddings to fill in the missing modalities of interest, enabling flexible and generalized multi-modal learning. Under our framework, any two modalities can be bound together, free from the dataset limitation, to achieve universal modality exploration. Further, to reveal the capability of our method, we study intensified scenarios where more than two datasets are needed for modality binding and show the effectiveness of BrokenBind in low-data regimes.

This phenomenon, commonly referred to as Concept Drift, has been intensively studied, and Concept Drift Detectors have been established as a class of methods for detecting such changes (drifts). For the most part, Drift Detectors compare regions (windows) of the data stream and detect drift if those windows are sufficiently dissimilar.\n  In this work, we introduce the Window Dilemma, an observation that perceived drift is a product of windowing and not necessarily the underlying data generating process. Additionally, we highlight that drift detection is ill-posed, primarily because verification of drift events are implausible in practice. We demonstrate these contributions first by an illustrative example, followed by empirical comparisons of drift detectors against a variety of alternative adaptation strategies. Our main finding is that traditional batch learning techniques often perform better than their drift-aware counterparts further bringing into question the purpose of detectors in Stream Classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u7a97\u53e3\u56f0\u5883\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u672c\u8eab\u662f\u75c5\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6279\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u6f02\u79fb\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a97\u53e3\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7a97\u53e3\u56f0\u5883\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7a97\u53e3\u56f0\u5883\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u793a\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u6f02\u79fb\u611f\u77e5\u662f\u7a97\u53e3\u5316\u7684\u4ea7\u7269\u800c\u975e\u5e95\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f20\u7edf\u6279\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f", "result": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6279\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u6f02\u79fb\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8d28\u7591\u4e86\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u6d41\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f5c\u7528", "conclusion": "\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7a97\u53e3\u56f0\u5883\u8868\u660e\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7a97\u53e3\u5316\u7684\u4ea7\u7269\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548"}}

For standard bilevel local regret, we propose an algorithm that achieves the optimal regret $\u03a9(1+V_T)$ with at most $O(T\\log T)$ total inner-level gradient evaluations. We further develop a fully single-loop algorithm whose regret bound includes an additional gradient-variation terms.

However, existing reward mechanisms remain tightly coupled to final correctness and pay little attention to the underlying reasoning process: trajectories with sound reasoning but wrong answers receive low credit, while lucky guesses with flawed logic may be highly rewarded, affecting reasoning generalization. From a causal perspective, we interpret multi-candidate reasoning for a fixed question as a family of counterfactual experiments with theoretical supports. Building on this, we propose Group Causal Counterfactual Policy Optimization to explicitly train LLMs to learn generalizable reasoning patterns. It proposes an episodic causal counterfactual reward that jointly captures (i) robustness, encouraging the answer distribution induced by a reasoning step to remain stable under counterfactual perturbations; and (ii) effectiveness, enforcing sufficient variability so that the learned reasoning strategy can transfer across questions.

A promising recent proposal, microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo, has shown state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of problems. However, its reliance on full-dataset gradients makes it prohibitively expensive for large-scale problems. This paper addresses a fundamental question: Can microcanonical dynamics effectively leverage mini-batch gradient noise? We provide the first systematic study of this problem, establishing a novel continuous-time theoretical analysis of stochastic-gradient microcanonical dynamics. We reveal two critical failure modes: a theoretically derived bias due to anisotropic gradient noise and numerical instabilities in complex high-dimensional posteriors. To tackle these issues, we propose a principled gradient noise preconditioning scheme shown to significantly reduce this bias and develop a novel, energy-variance-based adaptive tuner that automates step size selection and dynamically informs numerical guardrails. The resulting algorithm is a robust and scalable microcanonical Monte Carlo sampler that achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging high-dimensional inference tasks like Bayesian neural networks.

Existing automatic MAS generation methods either rely on code generation, which often leads to executability and robustness failures, or impose rigid architectural templates that limit expressiveness and adaptability. We propose Evolutionary Generation of Multi-Agent Systems (EvoMAS), which formulates MAS generation as structured configuration generation. EvoMAS performs evolutionary generation in configuration space. Specifically, EvoMAS selects initial configurations from a pool, applies feedback-conditioned mutation and crossover guided by execution traces, and iteratively refines both the candidate pool and an experience memory. We evaluate EvoMAS on diverse benchmarks, including BBEH, SWE-Bench, and WorkBench, covering reasoning, software engineering, and tool-use tasks. EvoMAS consistently improves task performance over both human-designed MAS and prior automatic MAS generation methods, while producing generated systems with higher executability and runtime robustness. EvoMAS outperforms the agent evolution method EvoAgent by +10.5 points on BBEH reasoning and +7.1 points on WorkBench.

However, these architectures require substantial training time and are prone to overfitting on datasets with short sequences. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm for knowledge tracing by leveraging tabular foundation models (TFMs). Unlike traditional methods that require offline training on a fixed training set, our approach performs real-time ''live'' knowledge tracing in an online way. The core of our method lies in a two-way attention mechanism: while attention knowledge tracing models only attend across earlier time steps, TFMs simultaneously attend across both time steps and interactions of other students in the training set. They align testing sequences with relevant training sequences at inference time, therefore skipping the training step entirely. We demonstrate, using several datasets of increasing size, that our method achieves competitive predictive performance with up to 273x speedups, in a setting where more student interactions are observed over time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TFMs\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe273\u500d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u77ed\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TFMs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u65f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\uff0c\u8fd8\u540c\u65f6\u5173\u6ce8\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\u5176\u4ed6\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u8df3\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe273\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u5b66\u751f\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eTFMs\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8df3\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Standard regularization techniques fail to precisely separate meaningful features from noise, while existing adversarial adaptation methods are limited by their reliance on explicit separation labels. To address this challenge, we propose the Adversarial Information Separation Framework (AdverISF), which isolates task-relevant features from noise without requiring explicit supervision. AdverISF introduces a self-supervised adversarial mechanism to enforce statistical independence between task-relevant features and noise representations. It further employs a multi-layer separation architecture that progressively recycles noise information across feature hierarchies to recover features inadvertently discarded as noise, thereby enabling finer-grained feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdverISF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in data-scarce scenarios.

A canonical failure mode is actuator inversion, where identical actions produce opposite physical effects under a latent binary context.

This shared modulation imparts an inductive bias matched to actuator inversion, while input/output normalization and random input masking stabilize context inference, promoting directionally concentrated representations. We provide theoretical support via an expressivity separation result for hypernetwork modulation, and a variance decomposition with policy-gradient variance bounds that formalize how within-mode compression improves learning under actuator inversion. For evaluation, we introduce the Actuator Inversion Benchmark (AIB), a suite of environments designed to isolate discontinuous context-to-dynamics interactions.

Although recent methods improve adaptability to heterogeneous tasks by generating customized merged models for each instance, they face two critical limitations. First, the instance-specific merged models lack reusability, restricting the exploitation of high-quality merging configurations and efficient batch inference. Second, these methods treat each task-specific model as a monolithic whole, overlooking the diverse mergeability of homologous components such as attention and multilayer perceptron layers, and the differing merging sensitivities across components.

MERGE formulates component-wise merging as a bi-objective optimization problem that balances cross-task performance and storage efficiency, and develops a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm to efficiently identify Pareto-optimal merging configurations. These high-quality configurations underpin a reusable modular expert library, from which a lightweight routing network dynamically activates and recombines modular experts to assemble input-specific models and enable efficient inference under storage constraints.

An arm yields a reward if and only if two conditions are satisfied: (i) the arm is activated according to an arm-specific Bernoulli random variable with unknown parameter, and (ii) the allocated budget exceeds a random threshold drawn from a parametric distribution with unknown parameter. Over $T$ rounds, the learner must jointly estimate the unknown parameters and allocate the budget so as to maximize cumulative reward facing the exploration--exploitation trade-off. We prove an information-theoretic regret lower bound $\u03a9(T^{1/3})$, demonstrating the intrinsic difficulty of the problem. We then propose RA-UCB, an optimistic algorithm that leverages non-trivial parameter estimation and confidence bounds.

In this work, we study how the choice of \\( p \\) affects sparsity and smoothness of adversarial attacks generated under \\( \\ell_p \\) norm constraints for values of $p \\in [1,2]$. To enable a quantitative analysis, we adopt two established sparsity measures from the literature and introduce three smoothness measures. In particular, we propose a general framework for deriving smoothness measures based on smoothing operations and additionally introduce a smoothness measure based on first-order Taylor approximations. Using these measures, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple real-world image datasets and a diverse set of model architectures, including both convolutional and transformer-based networks. We show that the choice of $\\ell_1$ or $\\ell_2$ is suboptimal in most cases and the optimal $p$ value is dependent on the specific task.

Instead of directly training the network from random weights, we first pre-train it to fit random noise, which leads to a structured and non-random parameter configuration. We show that this noise-driven pre-training significantly improves convergence speed in subsequent tasks, without requiring additional data or changes to the network architecture. The proposed method is particularly effective for implicit neural representations (INRs) and Deep Image Prior (DIP)-style networks, which are known to exhibit a strong low-frequency bias during optimization. After noise-based pre-training, the network is able to capture high-frequency components much earlier in training, leading to faster and more stable convergence. Although random noise contains no semantic information, it serves as an effective self-supervised signal (considering its white spectrum nature) for shaping the initialization of neural networks. Overall, this work demonstrates that noise-based pre-training offers a lightweight and general alternative to traditional random initialization, enabling more efficient optimization of deep neural networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u7f51\u7edc\u62df\u5408\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u540e\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Xavier\u3001Kaiming\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u672a\u5229\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INRs\uff09\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u5148\u9a8c\uff08DIP\uff09\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u7f13\u6162\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u62df\u5408\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u566a\u58f0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u66f4\u65e9\u6355\u83b7\u9ad8\u9891\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8eINRs\u548cDIP\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "conclusion": "\u566a\u58f0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u4f18\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u767d\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

The prevalent architecture of Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which relies on simplistic conditioning controls and a single-stream Transformer backbone, tends to underutilize cross-variate dependencies in covariate-aware forecasting. Inspired by Multimodal Diffusion Transformers that integrate textual guidance into video generation, we propose Diffusion Transformers for Time Series (DiTS), a general-purpose architecture that frames endogenous and exogenous variates as distinct modalities. To better capture both inter-variate and intra-variate dependencies, we design a dual-stream Transformer block tailored for time-series data, comprising a Time Attention module for autoregressive modeling along the temporal dimension and a Variate Attention module for cross-variate modeling. Unlike the common approach for images, which flattens 2D token grids into 1D sequences, our design leverages the low-rank property inherent in multivariate dependencies, thereby reducing computational costs. Experiments show that DiTS achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, regardless of the presence of future exogenous variate observations, demonstrating unique generative forecasting strengths over traditional deterministic deep forecasting models.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiTS\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6269\u6563Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6d41\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u591a\u7ef4\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u6269\u6563Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5355\u6d41Transformer\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u5728\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u53d8\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiTS\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u5185\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u6d41Transformer\u5757\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u53d8\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5143\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u7279\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "DiTS\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u6765\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u90fd\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DiTS\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u53cc\u6d41\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u800c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

We propose three mechanisms that drive this failure: (i) the generation of counterfactual trajectories, (ii) the distortion of temporal expectations, and (iii) the compounding of generalisation errors.

Applications with such strong requirement include information exchange between countries, medicine, banking, etc. This review aims to synthesize the current state-of-the-practice in this domain.\n  Objectives: The objective of this Systematic Review is to identify existing approaches for creating and evolving synthetic test data without using real-life raw data.\n  Methods: We followed well-known methodologies for conducting systematic literature reviews, including the ones from Kitchenham as well as guidelines for analysing the limitations of our review and its threats to validity.\n  Results: A variety of methods and tools exist for creating privacy-preserving test data. Our search found 1,013 publications in IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and SCOPUS. We extracted data from 75 of those publications and identified 37 approaches that answer our research question partly. A common prerequisite for using these methods and tools is direct access to real-life data for data anonymization or synthetic test data generation.

Supervised machine learning algorithms, which are commonly used for outcome prediction in the medical domain, optimize for predictive accuracy, which can result in models latching onto spurious correlations instead of robust predictors. Causal structure learning methods on the other hand have the potential to provide robust predictors for the target, but can be too conservative because of algorithmic and data assumptions, resulting in loss of diagnostic precision. Therefore, we propose a novel model-agnostic regularization strategy, Adaptive-CaRe, for generalized outcome prediction in the medical domain. Adaptive-CaRe strikes a balance between both predictive value and causal robustness by incorporating a penalty that is proportional to the difference between the estimated statistical contribution and estimated causal contribution of the input features for model predictions. Our experiments on synthetic data establish the efficacy of the proposed Adaptive-CaRe regularizer in finding robust predictors for the target while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy. With experiments on a standard causal benchmark, we provide a blueprint for navigating the trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness by tweaking the regularization strength, $\u03bb$. Validation using real-world dataset confirms that the results translate to practical, real-domain settings. Therefore, Adaptive-CaRe provides a simple yet effective solution to the long-standing trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness in the medical domain.

However, KL controls only an average divergence and does not directly prevent rare, large likelihood-ratio excursions that destabilize training--precisely the failure mode that motivates heuristics such as PPO's clipping. We propose overlap geometry as an alternative trust region, constraining distributional overlap via the Bhattacharyya coefficient (closely related to the Hellinger/Renyi-1/2 geometry). This objective penalizes separation in the ratio tails, yielding tighter control over likelihood-ratio excursions without relying on total variation bounds that can be loose in tail regimes. We derive Bhattacharyya-TRPO (BTRPO) and Bhattacharyya-PPO (BPPO), enforcing overlap constraints via square-root ratio updates: BPPO clips the square-root ratio q = sqrt(r), and BTRPO applies a quadratic Hellinger/Bhattacharyya penalty.

While prior federated learning attacks predominantly target accuracy or implant backdoors, we identify confidence calibration as a distinct attack objective. We present the Temperature Scaling Attack (TSA), a training-time attack that degrades calibration while preserving accuracy. By injecting temperature scaling with learning rate-temperature coupling during local training, malicious updates maintain benign-like optimization behavior, evading accuracy-based monitoring and similarity-based detection. We provide a convergence analysis under non-IID settings, showing that this coupling preserves standard convergence bounds while systematically distorting confidence. Across three benchmarks, TSA substantially shifts calibration (e.g., 145% error increase on CIFAR-100) with <2 accuracy change, and remains effective under robust aggregation and post-hoc calibration defenses. Case studies further show that confidence manipulation can cause up to 7.2x increases in missed critical cases (healthcare) or false alarms (autonomous driving), even when accuracy is unchanged. Overall, our results establish calibration integrity as a critical attack surface in federated learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u653b\u51fb\uff08TSA\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u653b\u51fb\u4e13\u95e8\u7834\u574f\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6821\u51c6\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5728\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\uff08\u5982\u5347\u7ea7\u3001\u5f03\u6743\u548c\u4fdd\u5b88\u56de\u9000\uff09\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5148\u524d\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u653b\u51fb\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6216\u690d\u5165\u540e\u95e8\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6e29\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u653b\u51fb\uff08TSA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u6ce8\u5165\u6e29\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387-\u6e29\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u6076\u610f\u66f4\u65b0\u4fdd\u6301\u7c7b\u4f3c\u826f\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89c4\u907f\u57fa\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTSA\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6821\u51c6\uff08\u4f8b\u5982CIFAR-100\u4e0a\u8bef\u5dee\u589e\u52a0145%\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u5c0f\u4e8e2%\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u548c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6821\u51c6\u9632\u5fa1\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\u3002\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u64cd\u7eb5\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u75c5\u4f8b\u6f0f\u68c0\u589e\u52a07.2\u500d\uff08\u533b\u7597\uff09\u6216\u8bef\u62a5\u589e\u52a0\uff08\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u662f\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u3002"}}

Existing analyses are often limited to finite-width statistics, lacking a rigorous characterisation of the global sparsity patterns that emerge as networks grow large. In this work, we connect discrete pruning heuristics to graph limit theory via graphons, establishing the graphon limit of PaI masks. We introduce a Factorised Saliency Model that encompasses popular pruning criteria and prove that, under regularity conditions, the discrete masks generated by these algorithms converge to deterministic bipartite graphons. This limit framework establishes a novel topological taxonomy for sparse networks: while unstructured methods (e.g., Random, Magnitude) converge to homogeneous graphons representing uniform connectivity, data-driven methods (e.g., SNIP, GraSP) converge to heterogeneous graphons that encode implicit feature selection. Leveraging this continuous characterisation, we derive two fundamental theoretical results: (i) a Universal Approximation Theorem for sparse networks that depends only on the intrinsic dimension of active coordinate subspaces; and (ii) a Graphon-NTK generalisation bound demonstrating how the limit graphon modulates the kernel geometry to align with informative features.

This is the regime of diffusion and flow-matching generators: although their internal dynamics are Markovian, rollout stability is governed by per-step \\emph{conditional law} errors. Using the Mori--Zwanzig projection formalism, we show that eliminating unresolved variables yields an exact resolved evolution with a Markov term, a memory term, and an orthogonal forcing, exposing a structural limitation of memoryless closures. Motivated by this, we introduce memory-conditioned diffusion/flow-matching with a compact online state injected into denoising via latent features. Via disintegration, memory induces a structured conditional tail prior for unresolved scales and reduces the transport needed to populate missing frequencies. We prove Wasserstein stability of the resulting conditional kernel. We then derive discrete Gr\u00f6nwall rollout bounds that separate memory approximation from conditional generation error.

Hyochan Chong and Dongkyu Kim contributed equally to this work", "summary": "Weight-only quantization has become a standard approach for efficiently serving large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods fail to efficiently compress models to binary (1-bit) levels, as they either require large amounts of data and compute or incur additional storage. In this work, we propose NanoQuant, the first post-training quantization (PTQ) method to compress LLMs to both binary and sub-1-bit levels. NanoQuant formulates quantization as a low-rank binary factorization problem, and compresses full-precision weights to low-rank binary matrices and scales. Specifically, it utilizes an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method to precisely initialize latent binary matrices and scales, and then tune the initialized parameters through a block and model reconstruction process. Consequently, NanoQuant establishes a new Pareto frontier in low-memory post-training quantization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy even at sub-1-bit compression rates. NanoQuant makes large-scale deployment feasible on consumer hardware.

We first show that architectural choices such as the position of Layer Normalization (LN) strongly modulates grokking speed. This modulation is explained by isolating how LN on specific pathways shapes shortcut-learning and attention entropy. Subsequently, we study how different optimization settings modulate grokking, inducing distinct interpretations of previously proposed controls such as readout scale. Particularly, we find that using readout scale as a control for lazy training can be confounded by learning rate and weight decay in our setting. Accordingly, we show that features evolve continuously throughout training, suggesting grokking in transformers can be more nuanced than a lazy-to-rich transition of the learning regime. Finally, we show how generalization predictably emerges with feature compressibility in grokking, across different modulators of inductive bias.

However, these diffusion-based approaches remain computationally intensive and slower than desired for large-scale structural exploration. While recent efforts like Proteina have introduced flow-matching to improve sampling efficiency, the potential of tokenization for structural compression and acceleration remains largely unexplored in the protein domain. In this work, we present SaDiT, a novel framework that accelerates protein backbone generation by integrating SaProt Tokenization with a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. SaDiT leverages a discrete latent space to represent protein geometry, significantly reducing the complexity of the generation process while maintaining theoretical SE(3) equivalence.

In practice, large group sizes are not feasible due to computational limits, which biases learning toward trajectories that are already likely.

We derive the probability that updates miss rare-correct modes as a function of group size, showing non-monotonic behavior, and characterize how updates redistribute mass within the correct set, revealing that unsampled-correct mass can shrink even as total correct mass grows. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a difficulty-aware advantage scaling coefficient, inspired by Focal loss, that down-weights updates on high-success prompts.

Solving MAPF optimally is known to be NP-hard, leading to the adoption of learning-based approaches to alleviate the online computational burden. Prevailing approaches, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically constrained to pairwise message passing between agents. However, this limitation leads to suboptimal behaviours and critical issues, such as attention dilution, particularly in dense environments where group (i.e. beyond just two agents) coordination is most critical. Despite the importance of such higher-order interactions, existing approaches have not been able to fully explore them. To address this representational bottleneck, we introduce HMAGAT (Hypergraph Multi-Agent Attention Network), a novel architecture that leverages attentional mechanisms over directed hypergraphs to explicitly capture group dynamics. Empirically, HMAGAT establishes a new state-of-the-art among learning-based MAPF solvers: e.g., despite having just 1M parameters and being trained on 100$\\times$ less data, it outperforms the current SoTA 85M parameter model. Through detailed analysis of HMAGAT's attention values, we demonstrate how hypergraph representations mitigate the attention dilution inherent in GNNs and capture complex interactions where pairwise methods fail.

Our method creates mathematical ``abstractions'' by replacing each KAN unit with a piecewise affine (PWA) function, providing both local and global error estimates between the original network and its approximation. These abstractions enable property verification by encoding the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), determining whether outputs satisfy specified properties when inputs belong to a given set. A critical challenge lies in balancing the number of pieces in the PWA approximation: too many pieces add binary variables that make verification computationally intractable, while too few pieces create excessive error margins that yield uninformative bounds. Our key contribution is a systematic framework that exploits KAN structure to find optimal abstractions. By combining dynamic programming at the unit level with a knapsack optimization across the network, we minimize the total number of pieces while guaranteeing specified error bounds. This approach determines the optimal approximation strategy for each unit while maintaining overall accuracy requirements. Empirical evaluation across multiple KAN benchmarks demonstrates that the upfront analysis costs of our method are justified by superior verification results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9a8c\u8bc1Kolmogorov-Arnold\u7f51\u7edc\uff08KANs\uff09\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06KAN\u5355\u5143\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u5206\u6bb5\u4eff\u5c04\u51fd\u6570\u521b\u5efa\u6570\u5b66\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528MILP\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u80cc\u5305\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5206\u6bb5\u6570\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "KANs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u7c7b\u5177\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u8d28\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406KANs\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06KAN\u5355\u5143\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u5206\u6bb5\u4eff\u5c04\uff08PWA\uff09\u51fd\u6570\u521b\u5efa\u6570\u5b66\u62bd\u8c61\uff1b2. \u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u59cb\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u8bef\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b3. \u5c06\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08MILP\uff09\uff1b4. \u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u5143\u7ea7\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u7ea7\u80cc\u5305\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u603b\u5206\u6bb5\u6570\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6307\u5b9a\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aKAN\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u524d\u671f\u5206\u6790\u6210\u672c\u88ab\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u6240\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684KAN\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u6bb5\u4eff\u5c04\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5206\u6bb5\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aKANs\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The main challenge lies in obtaining disentangled representations, where each latent dimension corresponds to a distinct generative factor. This difficulty is fundamentally tied to the inability to perform nonlinear independent component analysis. Here, we introduce the framework of action-induced representations (AIRs) which models representations of physical systems given experiments (or actions) that can be performed on them. We show that, in this framework, we can provably disentangle degrees of freedom w.r.t. their action dependence. We further introduce a variational AIR architecture (VAIR) that can extract AIRs and therefore achieve provable disentanglement where standard VAEs fail. Beyond state representation, VAIR also captures the action dependence of the underlying generative factors, directly linking experiments to the degrees of freedom they influence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c/\u52a8\u4f5c\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165VAIR\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u6807\u51c6VAE\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u83b7\u5f97\u89e3\u8026\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u5b50\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u56f0\u96be\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c/\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u53d8\u5206AIR\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u53d6AIRs\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u5730\u89e3\u8026\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5176\u52a8\u4f5c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002VAIR\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u53d6AIRs\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6VAE\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0cVAIR\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b66\u4e60\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5e95\u5c42\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8fde\u63a5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In particular, forward-backward algorithms (FB) can retrieve a family of policies that can approximately solve any standard RL problem (with additive rewards, linear in the occupancy measure), given sufficient capacity. While retaining zero-shot properties, we tackle the greater problem class of RL with general utilities, in which the objective is an arbitrary differentiable function of the occupancy measure. This setting is strictly more expressive, capturing tasks such as distribution matching or pure exploration, which may not be reduced to additive rewards. We show that this additional complexity can be captured by a novel, maximum entropy (soft) variant of the forward-backward algorithm, which recovers a family of stochastic policies from offline data. When coupled with zero-order search over compact policy embeddings, this algorithm can sidestep iterative optimization schemes, and optimizes general utilities directly at test-time.

Robustness means the model fine-tuned by concept erasure methods resists reactivation of erased concepts, even under semantically related prompts. Retention means unrelated concepts are preserved so the model's overall utility stays intact. Both are critical for concept erasure in practice, yet addressing them simultaneously is challenging, as existing works typically improve one factor while sacrificing the other. Prior work typically strengthens one while degrading the other, e.g., mapping a single erased prompt to a fixed safe target leaves class level remnants exploitable by prompt attacks, whereas retention-oriented schemes underperform against adaptive adversaries.

Despite this empirical success, its convergence properties are not well understood. In this paper, we bridge the gap by providing convergence guarantees for multicalibration gradient boosting in regression with squared-error loss. We show that the magnitude of successive prediction updates decays at $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$, which implies the same convergence rate bound for the multicalibration error over rounds. Under additional smoothness assumptions on the weak learners, this rate improves to linear convergence. We further analyze adaptive variants, showing local quadratic convergence of the training loss, and we study rescaling schemes that preserve convergence. Experiments on real-world datasets support our theory and clarify the regimes in which the method achieves fast convergence and strong multicalibration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u591a\u6821\u51c6\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u4ee5O(1/\u221aT)\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5728\u5f31\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u6ee1\u8db3\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u65f6\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6821\u51c6\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\u8d28\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u6821\u51c6\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u5e73\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u65b0\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u3002\u5728\u5f31\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u6ee1\u8db3\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u4f53\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u4e8c\u6b21\u6536\u655b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4fdd\u6301\u6536\u655b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff1a1) \u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u65b0\u5e45\u5ea6\u4ee5O(1/\u221aT)\u8870\u51cf\uff1b2) \u591a\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff1b3) \u5728\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\uff1b4) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u4e8c\u6b21\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u591a\u6821\u51c6\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Unlike robust PAC learning studied in prior work, here the clean data and its label are also adversarially chosen. We formulate this setting as an online learning problem and consider both the realizable and agnostic learnability of hypothesis classes. We define a new dimension of classes and show it controls the mistake bounds in the realizable setting and the regret bounds in the agnostic setting. In contrast to the dimension that characterizes learnability in the PAC setting, our dimension is rather simple and resembles the Littlestone dimension. We generalize our dimension to multiclass hypothesis classes and prove similar results in the realizable case.

To address this, we introduce the categorical Weisfeiler-Lehman framework, which formalizes lifting as a functorial mapping from an arbitrary data category to the unifying category of graded posets. When applied to hypergraphs, this perspective allows us to systematically derive Hypergraph Isomorphism Networks, a family of neural architectures where the message passing topology is strictly determined by the choice of functor. We introduce two distinct functors from the category of hypergraphs: an incidence functor and a symmetric simplicial complex functor. While the incidence architecture structurally mirrors standard bipartite schemes, our functorial derivation enforces a richer information flow over the resulting poset, capturing complex intersection geometries often missed by existing methods. We theoretically characterize the expressivity of these models, proving that both the incidence-based and symmetric simplicial approaches subsume the expressive power of the standard Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks validate these theoretical findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8303\u7574Weisfeiler-Lehman\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63d0\u5347\u6620\u5c04\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4ece\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u636e\u8303\u7574\u5230\u5206\u7ea7\u504f\u5e8f\u96c6\u8303\u7574\u7684\u51fd\u5b50\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u56fe\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u8d85\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u62d3\u6251\u4e25\u683c\u7531\u51fd\u5b50\u9009\u62e9\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u6620\u5c04\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e00\u8303\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8d85\u56fe\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u7136\u96f6\u6563\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u56fe\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8303\u7574Weisfeiler-Lehman\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63d0\u5347\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u51fd\u5b50\u6620\u5c04\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u4ece\u8d85\u56fe\u8303\u7574\u51fa\u53d1\u7684\u51fd\u5b50\uff1a\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u5b50\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u51fd\u5b50\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51fd\u5b50\u4e25\u683c\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u8d85\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u5bb6\u65cf\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5173\u8054\u57fa\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u8d85\u56feWeisfeiler-Lehman\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5173\u8054\u67b6\u6784\u867d\u7136\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6807\u51c6\u4e8c\u5206\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u51fd\u5b50\u63a8\u5bfc\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u504f\u5e8f\u96c6\u4e0a\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\uff0c\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u53e0\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8303\u7574Weisfeiler-Lehman\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8d85\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51fd\u5b50\u6620\u5c04\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u8d85\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u5bb6\u65cf\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Previous work showed that this approach could be further generalized: the original problem remains tractable even if the KL divergence is replaced by a family of $f$-divergence with a convex generating function $f$. Our first contribution is to show that convexity of $f$ is not essential. Instead, we identify a more general condition, referred to as DPO-inducing, that precisely characterizes when the RLHF problem remains tractable. Our next contribution is to establish a second condition on $f$ that is necessary to prevent probability displacement, a known empirical phenomenon in which the probabilities of the winner and the loser responses approach zero. We refer to any $f$ that satisfies this condition as displacement-resistant. We finally focus on a specific DPO-inducing and displacement-resistant $f$, leading to our novel SquaredPO loss.

By definition all rare events are hard to see, but the enormous scale of LLM usage means that events completely unobserved during development are likely to become prominent in deployment. Here we present an end-to-end framework for the systematic analysis of rare events in LLMs. We provide a practical implementation spanning theory, efficient generation strategies, probability estimation and error analysis, which we illustrate with concrete examples. We outline extensions and applications to other models and contexts, highlighting the generality of the concepts and techniques presented here.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u6790", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u2014\u2014\u8fdc\u79bb\u5178\u578b\u4f46\u9ad8\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0a\u96be\u4ee5\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u4f46LLM\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u4f7f\u7528\u89c4\u6a21\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u5b8c\u5168\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5177\u4f53\u793a\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5e94\u7528", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u6790LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u5177", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

We propose FlowDA, a low-latency weather-scale generative DA framework based on flow matching. FlowDA conditions on observations through a SetConv-based embedding and fine-tunes the Aurora foundation model to deliver accurate, efficient, and robust analyses. Experiments across observation rates decreasing from $3.9\\%$ to $0.1\\%$ demonstrate superior performance of FlowDA over strong baselines with similar tunable-parameter size.

This interpretation implicitly assumes steering directions are identifiable and uniquely recoverable from input-output behavior. We formalize steering as an intervention on internal representations and prove that, under realistic modeling and data conditions, steering vectors are fundamentally non-identifiable due to large equivalence classes of behaviorally indistinguishable interventions. Empirically, we validate this across multiple models and semantic traits, showing orthogonal perturbations achieve near-equivalent efficacy with negligible effect sizes.

Wei Fan", "Xiaozhuang Song", "Dandan Guo", "Yi Chang", "Hongyuan Zha"], "title": "Calibrating Tabular Anomaly Detection via Optimal Transport", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Tabular anomaly detection (TAD) remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of tabular data: features lack natural relationships, vary widely in distribution and scale, and exhibit diverse types. Consequently, each TAD method makes implicit assumptions about anomaly patterns that work well on some datasets but fail on others, and no method consistently outperforms across diverse scenarios. We present CTAD (Calibrating Tabular Anomaly Detection), a model-agnostic post-processing framework that enhances any existing TAD detector through sample-specific calibration. Our approach characterizes normal data via two complementary distributions, i.e., an empirical distribution from random sampling and a structural distribution from K-means centroids, and measures how adding a test sample disrupts their compatibility using Optimal Transport (OT) distance. Normal samples maintain low disruption while anomalies cause high disruption, providing a calibration signal to amplify detection. We prove that OT distance has a lower bound proportional to the test sample's distance from centroids, and establish that anomalies systematically receive higher calibration scores than normals in expectation, explaining why the method generalizes across datasets. Extensive experiments on 34 diverse tabular datasets with 7 representative detectors spanning all major TAD categories (density estimation, classification, reconstruction, and isolation-based methods) demonstrate that CTAD consistently improves performance with statistical significance.

These methods treat all prompts and denoising steps uniformly, ignoring substantial variations in sample learning value as well as the dynamic nature of critical exploration moments.\n  To address this issue, we conduct a detailed analysis of the internal attention dynamics during GRPO training and uncover a key insight: attention entropy can serve as a powerful dual-signal proxy. First, across different samples, the relative change in attention entropy (\u0394Entropy), which reflects the divergence between the current policy and the base policy, acts as a robust indicator of sample learning value. Second, during the denoising process, the peaks of absolute attention entropy (Entropy(t)), which quantify attention dispersion, effectively identify critical timesteps where high-value exploration occurs.\n  Building on this observation, we propose Adaptive Entropy-Guided Policy Optimization (AEGPO), a novel dual-signal, dual-level adaptive optimization strategy. At the global level, AEGPO uses \u0394Entropy to dynamically allocate rollout budgets, prioritizing prompts with higher learning value. At the local level, it exploits the peaks of Entropy(t) to guide exploration selectively at critical high-dispersion timesteps rather than uniformly across all denoising steps.\n  By focusing computation on the most informative samples and the most critical moments, AEGPO enables more efficient and effective policy optimization.

In this work, we bridge this gap by analyzing the reverse process dynamics through the lens of thermodynamic entropy production. We propose the entropy production rate as a rigorous proxy for quantifying information generation, deriving as a byproduct a bound on the Wasserstein distance between intermediate states and the data distribution. Leveraging these insights, we introduce two novel sampling schedules that are uniformly spaced with respect to their corresponding physics-inspired metrics: the Entropic Discrete Schedule (EDS), which is defined by maintaining a constant rate of information gain, and the Wasserstein Discrete Schedule (WDS), which is defined by taking equal steps in terms of the Wasserstein distance. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed schedules significantly outperform state-of-the-art strategies across diverse application domains, including synthetic data, music notation, vision and language modeling, consistently achieving superior performance at a lower computational budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff08EDS\u548cWDS\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53cd\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u539f\u7406\u8fdc\u4e0d\u5982\u8fde\u7eed\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u90a3\u6837\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff1b2) \u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u754c\u9650\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5747\u5300\u95f4\u9694\u91c7\u6837\u8c03\u5ea6\uff1a\u4fdd\u6301\u6052\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u7387\u7684\u71b5\u79bb\u6563\u8c03\u5ea6\uff08EDS\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u6b65\u957f\u7684Wasserstein\u79bb\u6563\u8c03\u5ea6\uff08WDS\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3001\u97f3\u4e50\u7b26\u53f7\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6d1e\u89c1\uff0c\u8fd8\u50ac\u751f\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, existing zero-shot GAD methods largely ignore intrinsic geometric differences across diverse anomaly patterns, substantially limiting their cross-domain generalization. In this work, we reveal that anomaly detectability is highly dependent on the underlying geometric properties and that embedding graphs from different domains into a single static curvature space can distort the structural signatures of anomalies. To address the challenge that a single curvature space cannot capture geometry-dependent graph anomaly patterns, we propose GAD-MoRE, a novel framework for zero-shot Generalizable Graph Anomaly Detection with a Mixture of Riemannian Experts architecture. Specifically, to ensure that each anomaly pattern is modeled in the Riemannian space where it is most detectable, GAD-MoRE employs a set of specialized Riemannian expert networks, each operating in a distinct curvature space. To align raw node features with curvature-specific anomaly characteristics, we introduce an anomaly-aware multi-curvature feature alignment module that projects inputs into parallel Riemannian spaces, enabling the capture of diverse geometric characteristics. Finally, to facilitate better generalization beyond seen patterns, we design a memory-based dynamic router that adaptively assigns each input to the most compatible expert based on historical reconstruction performance on similar anomalies.

This study introduces T-STAR (Two-stage Spatial and Temporal Adaptive contextual Representation), a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework designed to forecast station-level bike-sharing demand at a 15-minute resolution. T-STAR addresses key challenges in high-resolution forecasting by disentangling consistent demand patterns from short-term fluctuations through a hierarchical two-stage structure. The first stage captures coarse-grained hourly demand patterns, while the second stage improves prediction accuracy by incorporating high-frequency, localized inputs, including recent fluctuations and real-time demand variations in connected metro services, to account for temporal shifts in short-term demand. Time series transformer models are employed in both stages to generate probabilistic predictions. Extensive experiments using Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare data demonstrate that T-STAR outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic accuracy.

More recently, matrix-based spectral optimizers like Muon (Jordan et al., 2024b) show the power of treating weight matrices as matrices rather than long vectors. Linking these is hard because many natural generalizations are not feasible to implement, and we also cannot simply move the Adam adaptation to the matrix spectrum. To address this, we reformulate the AdaGrad update and decompose it into a variance adaptation term and a scale-invariant term. This decoupling produces $\\textbf{DeVA}$ ($\\textbf{De}$coupled $\\textbf{V}$ariance $\\textbf{A}$daptation), a framework that bridges between vector-based variance adaptation and matrix spectral optimization, enabling a seamless transition from Adam to adaptive spectral descent. Extensive experiments across language modeling and image classification demonstrate that DeVA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Muon and SOAP (Vyas et al., 2024), reducing token usage by around 6.6\\%.

However, its role in transfer learning remains poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the ability of vision transformer components to adapt their outputs to changes in inputs, or, in other words, their plasticity. Defined as an average rate of change, it captures the sensitivity to input perturbation; in particular, a high plasticity implies low smoothness. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments that this perspective provides principled guidance in choosing the components to prioritize during adaptation. A key takeaway for practitioners is that the high plasticity of the attention modules and feedforward layers consistently leads to better finetuning performance. Our findings depart from the prevailing assumption that smoothness is desirable, offering a novel perspective on the functional properties of transformers.

Current graph-based surrogates do not have full-cycle prediction capabilities, and physics-informed neural networks often struggle to converge on complex cardiac geometries. We present CardioGraphFENet (CGFENet), a unified graph-based surrogate for rapid full-cycle estimation of LV myocardial biomechanics, supervised by a large FEA simulation dataset. The proposed model integrates (i) a global--local graph encoder to capture mesh features with weak-form-inspired global coupling, (ii) a gated recurrent unit-based temporal encoder conditioned on the target volume-time signal to model cycle-coherent dynamics, and (iii) a cycle-consistent bidirectional formulation for both loading and inverse unloading within a single framework. These strategies enable high fidelity with respect to traditional FEA ground truths and produce physiologically plausible pressure-volume loops that match FEA results when coupled with a lumped-parameter model. In particular, the cycle-consistency strategy enables a significant reduction in FEA supervision with only minimal loss in accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "CGFENet\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u5de6\u5fc3\u5ba4\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u5feb\u901f\u5168\u5468\u671f\u4f30\u8ba1\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5206\u6790\u76d1\u7763\u9700\u6c42", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5de6\u5fc3\u5ba4\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5fc3\u810f\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e72\u9884\u89c4\u5212\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5468\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5fc3\u810f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u6536\u655b\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCardioGraphFENet\uff08CGFENet\uff09\uff0c\u6574\u5408\uff1a1\uff09\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6355\u6349\u7f51\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u5468\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u52a8\u6001\uff1b3\uff09\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53cc\u5411\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5904\u7406\u52a0\u8f7d\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u5378\u8f7d", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0e\u96c6\u603b\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8026\u5408\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u751f\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u538b\u529b-\u5bb9\u79ef\u73af\u3002\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5206\u6790\u76d1\u7763\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931", "conclusion": "CGFENet\u4e3a\u5de6\u5fc3\u5ba4\u5fc3\u808c\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u56fe\u57fa\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027"}}

This problem becomes solvable only by exploiting specific structural or distributional assumptions. While recent work has separately utilized time-series dynamics or multi-environment heterogeneity to constrain this problem, we integrate both as complementary sources of heterogeneity. This integration yields unified necessary identifiability conditions and enables a rigorous analysis of the statistical limits of recovery under thin versus heavy-tailed noise. In particular, temporal structure is shown to effectively substitute for missing environmental diversity, possibly achieving identifiability even under insufficient heterogeneity. Extending this analysis to heavy-tailed (Student's t) distributions, we demonstrate that while geometric identifiability conditions remain invariant, the sample complexity diverges significantly from the Gaussian baseline. Explicit information-theoretic bounds quantify this cost of robustness, establishing the fundamental limits of covariance-based causal graph recovery methods in realistic non-stationary systems.

Specifically, we generalize the standard setting by allowing the movement cost coefficients $\u03bb_t$ to vary arbitrarily over time. Our main contribution is a novel algorithm that establishes the first comparator-adaptive dynamic regret bound for this setting, guaranteeing $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{(1+P_T)(T+\\sum_t \u03bb_t)})$ regret, where $P_T$ is the path length of the comparator sequence over $T$ rounds. This recovers the optimal guarantees for both static and dynamic regret in standard OCO as a special case where $\u03bb_t=0$ for all rounds. To demonstrate the versatility of our results, we consider two applications: OCO with delayed feedback and OCO with time-varying memory. We show that both problems can be translated into time-varying movement costs, establishing a novel reduction specifically for the delayed feedback setting that is of independent interest. A crucial observation is that the first-order dependence on movement costs in our regret bound plays a key role in enabling optimal comparator-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees in both settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u65f6\u53d8\u79fb\u52a8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u6bd4\u8f83\u5668\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e24\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5047\u8bbe\u79fb\u52a8\u6210\u672c\u7cfb\u6570\u03bb_t\u4e3a\u96f6\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u80fd\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u8fd9\u4e00\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u79fb\u52a8\u6210\u672c\u7cfb\u6570\u03bb_t\u4efb\u610f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u5668\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff1a$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{(1+P_T)(T+\\sum_t \u03bb_t)})$\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dP_T\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u5668\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u65f6\u53d8\u79fb\u52a8\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u6bd4\u8f83\u5668\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u8be5\u754c\u5728\u03bb_t=0\u65f6\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002\u4e3a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5668\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5e26\u79fb\u52a8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u79fb\u52a8\u6210\u672c\u7cfb\u6570\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u4efb\u610f\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6bd4\u8f83\u5668\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Traditionally, therapeutic TMS has been applied in a one-size-fits-all approach, disregarding inter- and intra-individual differences. Brain state-dependent EEG-TMS, such as coupling TMS with a pre-specified phase of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm, enables the induction of differential neuroplastic effects depending on the targeted phase. But this approach is still user-dependent as it requires defining an a-priori target phase. Objectives: To present a first realization of a machine-learning-based, closed-loop real-time EEG-TMS setup to identify user-independently the individual mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-corticospinal excitability states. Methods: We applied EEG-TMS to 25 participants targeting the supplementary motor area-primary motor cortex network and used a reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low corticospinal excitability. We employed linear mixed effects models and Bayesian analysis to determine effects of reinforced learning on corticospinal excitability indexed by motor evoked potential amplitude, and functional connectivity indexed by the imaginary part of resting-state EEG coherence. Results: Reinforcement learning effectively identified the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-excitability states, and their repetitive stimulation resulted in long-term increases vs. decreases in functional connectivity in the stimulated sensorimotor network. Conclusions: We demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of closed-loop EEG-TMS in humans, a critical step towards individualized treatment of brain disorders.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u5b9e\u65f6EEG-TMS\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u9ad8/\u4f4e\u76ae\u8d28\u810a\u9ad3\u5174\u594b\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316mu\u8282\u5f8b\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8111\u523a\u6fc0\u6cbb\u7597\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTMS\u6cbb\u7597\u91c7\u7528\"\u4e00\u5200\u5207\"\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5185\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8111\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56EEG-TMS\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u9700\u8981\u7528\u6237\u9884\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u7528\u6237\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8111\u523a\u6fc0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5bf925\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5e94\u7528EEG-TMS\uff0c\u9776\u5411\u8f85\u52a9\u8fd0\u52a8\u533a-\u521d\u7ea7\u8fd0\u52a8\u76ae\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u9ad8/\u4f4e\u76ae\u8d28\u810a\u9ad3\u5174\u594b\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684mu\u8282\u5f8b\u76f8\u4f4d\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u76ae\u8d28\u810a\u9ad3\u5174\u594b\u6027\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bf1\u53d1\u7535\u4f4d\u5e45\u5ea6\uff09\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u606f\u6001EEG\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u865a\u90e8\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e0e\u9ad8/\u4f4e\u5174\u594b\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u7684mu\u8282\u5f8b\u76f8\u4f4d\u3002\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u523a\u6fc0\u5bfc\u81f4\u53d7\u523a\u6fc0\u611f\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u957f\u671f\u589e\u52a0\u6216\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u95ed\u73afEEG-TMS\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8111\u75be\u75c5\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

True intelligence relies on \"world models\" -- causal abstractions that allow an agent to not only predict future states but understand the underlying governing dynamics. While previous \"AI Physicist\" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively \"bake in\" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations. Our results demonstrate that simple architectural choices determine whether an AI becomes a curve-fitter or a physicist, marking a critical step toward automated scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u901a\u7528Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f2\u7ebf\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u771f\u6b63\u5b66\u4e60\u5f00\u666e\u52d2\u548c\u725b\u987f\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u9884\u6d4b\u5230\u7269\u7406\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u7528AI\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u5426\u8d85\u8d8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u771f\u6b63\u53d1\u73b0\u5b87\u5b99\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\"AI\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\"\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u7528Transformer\u867d\u7136\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5374\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u83b7\u5e95\u5c42\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9\u901a\u7528\u67b6\u6784\u83b7\u5f97\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff1a1\uff09\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\uff1a\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u56de\u5f52\uff1b2\uff09\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff1b3\uff09\u65f6\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff1a\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a97\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u5728\u6700\u8fd1\u8fc7\u53bb\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u800c\u975e\u590d\u6742\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u524d\u4e24\u4e2a\u504f\u7f6e\u4f7fTransformer\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5f00\u666e\u52d2\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u62df\u5408\u884c\u661f\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u692d\u5706\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u4f46\u53ea\u6709\u52a0\u5165\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u504f\u7f6e\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff09\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u624d\u4f1a\u653e\u5f03\u66f2\u7ebf\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u771f\u6b63\u53d1\u73b0\u725b\u987f\u529b\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u7269\u7406\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86AI\u662f\u6210\u4e3a\u66f2\u7ebf\u62df\u5408\u5668\u8fd8\u662f\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6700\u5c0f\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9\u901a\u7528AI\u67b6\u6784\u8d85\u8d8a\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002"}}

We propose Low-rank Error Informed Adaptation (LEIA), a simple two-stage method that improves group robustness by identifying a low-dimensional subspace in the representation space where model errors concentrate. LEIA restricts adaptation to this error-informed subspace via a low-rank adjustment to the classifier logits, directly targeting latent failure modes without modifying the backbone or requiring group labels. Using five real-world datasets, we analyze group robustness under three settings: (1) truly no knowledge of subgroup relevance, (2) partial knowledge of subgroup relevance, and (3) full knowledge of subgroup relevance.

We show that this decoupled formulation introduces substantial deployment and adaptation lag: (1) high time-to-serve, since a speculator must be trained offline for a considerable period before deployment; (2) delayed utility feedback, since the true end-to-end decoding speedup is only known after training and cannot be inferred reliably from acceptance rate alone due to model-architecture and system-level overheads; and (3) domain-drift degradation, as the target model is repurposed to new domains and the speculator becomes stale and less effective.\n  To address these issues, we present Aurora, a unified training-serving system that closes the loop by continuously learning a speculator directly from live inference traces. Aurora reframes online speculator learning as an asynchronous reinforcement-learning problem: accepted tokens provide positive feedback, while rejected speculator proposals provide implicit negative feedback that we exploit to improve sample efficiency. Our design integrates an SGLang-based inference server with an asynchronous training server, enabling hot-swapped speculator updates without service interruption. Crucially, Aurora supports day-0 deployment: a speculator can be served immediately and rapidly adapted to live traffic, improving system performance while providing immediate utility feedback. Across experiments, Aurora achieves a 1.5x day-0 speedup on recently released frontier models (e.g., MiniMax M2.1 229B and Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B). Aurora also adapts effectively to distribution shifts in user traffic, delivering an additional 1.25x speedup over a well-trained but static speculator on widely used models (e.g., Qwen3 and Llama3).", "AI": {"tldr": "Aurora\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3-\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u5206\u79bb\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u53cd\u9988\u6ede\u540e\u548c\u9886\u57df\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u5c06\u63a8\u6d4b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u9ad8\u670d\u52a1\u51c6\u5907\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u9700\u8981\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\uff1b2) \u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u6548\u7528\u53cd\u9988\uff08\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89e3\u7801\u52a0\u901f\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\uff1b3) \u9886\u57df\u6f02\u79fb\u9000\u5316\uff08\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u65f6\u63a8\u6d4b\u5668\u53d8\u5f97\u9648\u65e7\u4f4e\u6548\u3002", "method": "Aurora\u5c06\u5728\u7ebf\u63a8\u6d4b\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5f02\u6b65\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u63a5\u53d7\u6807\u8bb0\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b63\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u5668\u63d0\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u9690\u5f0f\u8d1f\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210SGLang\u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u548c\u5f02\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u70ed\u63d2\u62d4\u63a8\u6d4b\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u65e5\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "Aurora\u5728\u65b0\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982MiniMax M2.1 229B\u548cQwen3-Coder-Next 80B\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b01.5\u500d\u96f6\u65e5\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Qwen3\u548cLlama3\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u826f\u597d\u4f46\u9759\u6001\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u989d\u5916\u83b7\u5f971.25\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "Aurora\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3-\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u65e5\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901fLLM\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u3002"}}

The Bellman equation that is the central pillar of Reinforcement learning (RL) becomes only approximately valid under Non-Markovian. Existing work often focus on practical algorithm designs and offer limited theoretical treatment to address key questions, such as what dynamics are indeed capturable by the Bellman framework and how to inspire new algorithm classes with optimal approximations. In this paper, we present a novel topological viewpoint on temporal-difference (TD) based RL. We show that TD errors can be viewed as 1-cochain in the topological space of state transitions, while Markov dynamics are then interpreted as topological integrability. This novel view enables us to obtain a Hodge-type decomposition of TD errors into an integrable component and a topological residual, through a Bellman-de Rham projection. We further propose HodgeFlow Policy Search (HFPS) by fitting a potential network to minimize the non-integrable projection residual in RL, achieving stability/sensitivity guarantees. In numerical evaluations, HFPS is shown to significantly improve RL performance under non-Markovian.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u770b\u5f85\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\uff08TD\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c06TD\u8bef\u5dee\u89c6\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u62d3\u6251\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76841-\u4e0a\u94fe\uff0c\u5c06\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u62d3\u6251\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Bellman-de Rham\u6295\u5f71\u5b9e\u73b0TD\u8bef\u5dee\u7684Hodge\u578b\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HodgeFlow\u7b56\u7565\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u52a8\u6001\uff08\u5982\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u652f\u67f1Bellman\u65b9\u7a0b\u5728\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4ec5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6210\u7acb\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6765\u56de\u7b54\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u54ea\u4e9b\u52a8\u6001\u80fd\u88abBellman\u6846\u67b6\u6355\u83b7\uff1f\u5982\u4f55\u542f\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7c7b\u522b\uff1f", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u62d3\u6251\u89c6\u89d2\uff1a\u5c06TD\u8bef\u5dee\u89c6\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u62d3\u6251\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76841-\u4e0a\u94fe\uff0c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u62d3\u6251\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Bellman-de Rham\u6295\u5f71\u83b7\u5f97TD\u8bef\u5dee\u7684Hodge\u578b\u5206\u89e3\uff08\u53ef\u79ef\u5206\u91cf+\u62d3\u6251\u6b8b\u5dee\uff09\u3002\u63d0\u51faHodgeFlow\u7b56\u7565\u641c\u7d22\uff08HFPS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u52bf\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316RL\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u79ef\u6295\u5f71\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027/\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cHFPS\u5728\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u62d3\u6251\u89c6\u89d2\u4e3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06TD\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u79ef\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u79ef\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684HFPS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3Bellman\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We term this Endogenous Steering Resistance (ESR). Using sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to steer model activations, we find that Llama-3.3-70B shows substantial ESR, while smaller models from the Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families exhibit the phenomenon less frequently. We identify 26 SAE latents that activate differentially during off-topic content and are causally linked to ESR in Llama-3.3-70B. Zero-ablating these latents reduces the multi-attempt rate by 25%, providing causal evidence for dedicated internal consistency-checking circuits. We demonstrate that ESR can be deliberately enhanced through both prompting and training: meta-prompts instructing the model to self-monitor increase the multi-attempt rate by 4x for Llama-3.3-70B, and fine-tuning on self-correction examples successfully induces ESR-like behavior in smaller models. These findings have dual implications: ESR could protect against adversarial manipulation but might also interfere with beneficial safety interventions that rely on activation steering. Understanding and controlling these resistance mechanisms is important for developing transparent and controllable AI systems.

To overcome this, the study proposes an enhanced workflow based on the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)-a transparent, state-of-the-art implementation of the GA2M algorithm-optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and preprocessing refinement. Rather than relying on conventional sampling techniques that may introduce bias or cause information loss, the optimized EBM achieves an effective balance between accuracy and interpretability, enabling precise detection of fraudulent transactions while providing actionable insights into feature importance and interaction effects. Furthermore, the Taguchi method is employed to optimize both the sequence of data scalers and model hyperparameters, ensuring robust, reproducible, and systematically validated performance improvements. Experimental evaluation on benchmark credit card data yields an ROC-AUC of 0.983, surpassing prior EBM baselines (0.975) and outperforming Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree models.

Generative models offer an alternative: they can uncover structure without such assumptions and act as priors that improve intervention fidelity. We explore this direction by training diffusion models on one billion residual stream activations, creating \"meta-models\" that learn the distribution of a network's internal states. We find that diffusion loss decreases smoothly with compute and reliably predicts downstream utility. In particular, applying the meta-model's learned prior to steering interventions improves fluency, with larger gains as loss decreases. Moreover, the meta-model's neurons increasingly isolate concepts into individual units, with sparse probing scores that scale as loss decreases.

Fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) introduce computation and parameter count bottlenecks within neural network architectures. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new class of dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected feedforward layers, \\textbf{E}fficient, \\textbf{U}nified and \\textbf{Gen}eral dense layers (EUGens). EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \\textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \\textbf{27}\\%) and memory efficiency (up to \\textbf{30}\\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction.

This is especially the case since traditional optimization methods often face high computational complexity, motivating the use of deep learning (DL)-based optimization frameworks. In this context, this paper considers a multi-antenna base station (BS) serving multiple users simultaneously through transmit beamforming in downlink mode. To account for robustness, this work proposes an uncertainty-injected deep unfolded fractional programming (UI-DUFP) framework for weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization under imperfect channel conditions. The proposed method unfolds fractional programming (FP) iterations into trainable neural network layers refined by projected gradient descent (PGD) steps, while robustness is introduced by injecting sampled channel uncertainties during training and optimizing a quantile-based objective. Simulation results show that the proposed UI-DUFP achieves higher WSR and improved robustness compared to classical weighted minimum mean square error, FP, and DL baselines, while maintaining low inference time and good scalability.

Studies of the internal representations of Large Language Models (LLMs) support their ability to parse text when predicting the next word, while representing semantic notions independently of surface form. Yet, which data statistics make these feats possible, and how much data is required, remain largely unknown. Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) provide a tractable testbed for studying these questions. However, prior work has focused either on the post-hoc characterization of the parsing-like algorithms used by trained networks; or on the learnability of PCFGs with fixed syntax, where parsing is unnecessary. Here, we (i) introduce a tunable class of PCFGs in which both the degree of ambiguity and the correlation structure across scales can be controlled; (ii) provide a learning mechanism -- an inference algorithm inspired by the structure of deep convolutional networks -- that links learnability and sample complexity to specific language statistics; and (iii) validate our predictions empirically across deep convolutional and transformer-based architectures.

We propose using LLM-based comparative ranking (via pairwise comparisons and a Bradley--Terry model) to identify a borderline band \\emph{before} human reviewing and to allocate \\emph{marginal} reviewer capacity at assignment time. Concretely, given a venue-specific minimum review target (e.g., 3 or 4), we use this signal to decide which papers receive one additional review (e.g., a 4th or 5th), without conditioning on any human reviews and without using LLM outputs for accept/reject. We provide a simple expected-impact calculation in terms of (i) the overlap between the predicted and true borderline sets ($\u03c1$) and (ii) the incremental value of an extra review near the boundary ($\u0394$), and we provide retrospective proxies to estimate these quantities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578bML\u4f1a\u8bae\u5e94\u5c06\u989d\u5916\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d44\u6e90\u96c6\u4e2d\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u8fb9\u754c\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u6bd4\u8f83\u6392\u540d\u8bc6\u522b\u8fb9\u754c\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u5728\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5206\u914d\u9636\u6bb5\u51b3\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e9b\u8bba\u6587\u83b7\u5f97\u989d\u5916\u8bc4\u5ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u989d\u5916\u8bc4\u5ba1\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6216\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u9ad8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u8fb9\u9645\u8bc4\u5ba1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u548cBradley-Terry\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8bba\u6587\u76f8\u5bf9\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u524d\u8bc6\u522b\u8fb9\u754c\u8bba\u6587\u5e26\u3002\u6839\u636e\u4f1a\u8bae\u6700\u4f4e\u8bc4\u5ba1\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u59823\u62164\u6b21\uff09\uff0c\u51b3\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e9b\u8bba\u6587\u83b7\u5f97\u989d\u5916\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff08\u5982\u7b2c4\u6216\u7b2c5\u6b21\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9884\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u9884\u6d4b\u8fb9\u754c\u96c6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u8fb9\u754c\u96c6\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\uff08\u03c1\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fb9\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u989d\u5916\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u4ef7\u503c\uff08\u0394\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u56de\u987e\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u989d\u5916\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u63a5\u53d7/\u62d2\u7edd\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

We provide an explicit algorithm for computing this discriminant. We further introduce the parameter discriminant of a neural network, identifying parameters where the ED degree drops and the decision boundary exhibits reduced algebraic complexity. We derive closed-form expressions for the ED degree for several classes of neural architectures, as well as formulas for the expected number of real critical points in the infinite-width limit.

A variety of approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem, including variational methods. However, variational training often struggle to navigate complex energy landscapes, frequently encountering suboptimal local minima or suffering from barren plateaus. In this work, we introduce an iterative strategy for ground-state preparation based on a stepwise (discretized) Hamiltonian deformation. By complementing the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with adiabatic principles, we demonstrate that solving a sequence of intermediate problems facilitates tracking the ground-state manifold toward the target system, even as we scale the system size. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving a lower bound on the loss variance that suggests trainability throughout the deformation, provided the system remains away from gap closings.

Traditionally, such locally optimized decisions are made by hand-coded algorithms tuned for a small number of benchmarks, often requiring significant effort to be retuned when the benchmark suite changes. In the past 20 years, Machine Learning has been employed to construct performance models to improve the selection and ordering of compiler optimizations, however, the approaches are not baked into the compiler seamlessly and never materialized to be leveraged at a fine-grained scope of code segments. This paper presents Protean Compiler: An agile framework to enable LLVM with built-in phase-ordering capabilities at a fine-grained scope. The framework also comprises a complete library of more than 140 handcrafted static feature collection methods at varying scopes, and the experimental results showcase speedup gains of up to 4.1% on average and up to 15.7% on select Cbench applications wrt LLVM's O3 by just incurring a few extra seconds of build time on Cbench.

We propose a three-tier Know Your Customer (KYC) framework, inspired by anti-money laundering (AML) practices in the financial sector, that shifts governance from content inspection to user verification and monitoring. Tier I leverages research institutions as trust anchors to vouch for affiliated researchers and assume responsibility for vetting. Tier II applies output screening through sequence homology searches and functional annotation. Tier III monitors behavioral patterns to detect anomalies inconsistent with declared research purposes.

Published at TMLR 2026 with Survey Certification", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities, achieving impressive results across a wide range of tasks. Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios. To systematically understand and address these shortcomings, we present the first comprehensive survey dedicated to reasoning failures in LLMs. We introduce a novel categorization framework that distinguishes reasoning into embodied and non-embodied types, with the latter further subdivided into informal (intuitive) and formal (logical) reasoning. In parallel, we classify reasoning failures along a complementary axis into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures that broadly affect downstream tasks; application-specific limitations that manifest in particular domains; and robustness issues characterized by inconsistent performance across minor variations. For each reasoning failure, we provide a clear definition, analyze existing studies, explore root causes, and present mitigation strategies. By unifying fragmented research efforts, our survey provides a structured perspective on systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights and guiding future research towards building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities. We additionally release a comprehensive collection of research works on LLM reasoning failures, as a GitHub repository at https://github.com/Peiyang-Song/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-Failures, to provide an easy entry point to this area.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u4e0e\u975e\u5177\u8eab\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u5206\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e09\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f31\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u770b\u4f3c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u975e\u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u975e\u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u4e3a\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\uff08\u76f4\u89c9\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6b63\u5f0f\uff08\u903b\u8f91\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\uff1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u9650\u5236\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u4e3a\u6bcf\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f31\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u8c03\u67e5\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86GitHub\u8d44\u6e90\u5e93\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fbf\u6377\u5165\u53e3\u3002"}}

Existing thermal backbones that follow task-specific training from small-scale data result in utility limited to a specific environment and task. Unlike prior methods, AnyThermal can be used for a wide range of environments (indoor, aerial, off-road, urban) and tasks, all without task-specific training. Our key insight is to distill the feature representations from visual foundation models such as DINOv2 into a thermal encoder using thermal data from these multiple environments. To bridge the diversity gap of the existing RGB-Thermal datasets, we introduce the TartanRGBT platform, the first open-source data collection platform with synced RGB-Thermal image acquisition. We use this payload to collect the TartanRGBT dataset - a diverse and balanced dataset collected in 4 environments.

Most recent benchmark protocols and training pipelines are waypoint-based, which makes action-based policies harder to train and compare, slowing their progress. To bridge this waypoint-action gap, we propose a novel, differentiable vehicle-model framework that rolls out predicted action sequences to their corresponding ego-frame waypoint trajectories while supervising in waypoint space. Our approach enables action-based architectures to be trained and evaluated, for the first time, within waypoint-based benchmarks without modifying the underlying evaluation protocol. We extensively evaluate our framework across multiple challenging benchmarks and observe consistent improvements over the baselines.

To probe this geometry, we begin from the Iso-Energy Assumption, which exploits cross-modal redundancy: a concept that is truly shared should exhibit the same average energy across modalities. We operationalize this assumption with an Aligned Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) that encourages energy consistency during training while preserving reconstruction. We find that this inductive bias changes the SAE solution without harming reconstruction, giving us a representation that serves as a tool for geometric analysis. Sanity checks on controlled data with known ground truth confirm that alignment improves when Iso-Energy holds and remains neutral when it does not. Applied to foundational VLMs, our framework reveals a clear structure with practical consequences: (i) sparse bimodal atoms carry the entire cross-modal alignment signal; (ii) unimodal atoms act as modality-specific biases and fully explain the modality gap; (iii) removing unimodal atoms collapses the gap without harming performance; (iv) restricting vector arithmetic to the bimodal subspace yields in-distribution edits and improved retrieval. These findings suggest that the right inductive bias can both preserve model fidelity and render the latent geometry interpretable and actionable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u627f\u8f7d\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u95f4\u9699\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4ecd\u7136\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u540c\u80fd\u91cf\u5047\u8bbe\uff08Iso-Energy Assumption\uff09\uff1a\u771f\u6b63\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u80fd\u91cf\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5047\u8bbe\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9f13\u52b1\u80fd\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u91cd\u6784\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840VLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u7a00\u758f\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u627f\u8f7d\u5168\u90e8\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b2\uff09\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\uff1b3\uff09\u79fb\u9664\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6027\u80fd\uff1b4\uff09\u5c06\u5411\u91cf\u8fd0\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u5728\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4f7f\u6f5c\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3VLMs\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks.

We introduce a unified node-level formalization with tensor-valued activations and show that generalized feedforward networks form a strict subset of generalized convolutional networks. Motivated by the mismatch in per-input parameterization between the two families, we propose model projection, a parameter-efficient transfer learning method for CNNs that freezes pretrained per-input-channel filters and learns a single scalar gate for each (output channel, input channel) contribution. Projection keeps all convolutional layers adaptable to downstream tasks while substantially reducing the number of trained parameters in convolutional layers. We prove that projected nodes take the generalized FFN form, enabling projected CNNs to inherit feedforward techniques that do not rely on homogeneous layer inputs.

We introduce the Medical Prompt Injection Benchmark (MPIB), a dataset-and-benchmark suite for evaluating clinical safety under both direct prompt injection and indirect, RAG-mediated injection across clinically grounded tasks. MPIB emphasizes outcome-level risk via the Clinical Harm Event Rate (CHER), which measures high-severity clinical harm events under a clinically grounded taxonomy, and reports CHER alongside Attack Success Rate (ASR) to disentangle instruction compliance from downstream patient risk. The benchmark comprises 9,697 curated instances constructed through multi-stage quality gates and clinical safety linting. Evaluating MPIB across a diverse set of baseline LLMs and defense configurations, we find that ASR and CHER can diverge substantially, and that robustness depends critically on whether adversarial instructions appear in the user query or in retrieved context. We release MPIB with evaluation code, adversarial baselines, and comprehensive documentation to support reproducible and systematic research on clinical prompt injection.

However, an analytical framework for describing the high-dimensional asymptotic behavior of multi-pass SGD with small batch sizes for nonlinear models is currently missing. In this study, we address this gap by analyzing the high-dimensional dynamics of a stochastic differential equation called a \\emph{stochastic gradient flow} (SGF), which approximates multi-pass SGD in this regime. In the limit where the number of data samples $n$ and the dimension $d$ grow proportionally, we derive a closed system of low-dimensional and continuous-time equations and prove that it characterizes the asymptotic distribution of the SGF parameters. Our theory is based on the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and is applicable to a wide range of models encompassing generalized linear models and two-layer neural networks. We further show that the resulting DMFT equations recover several existing high-dimensional descriptions of SGD dynamics as special cases, thereby providing a unifying perspective on prior frameworks such as online SGD and high-dimensional linear regression. Our proof builds on the existing DMFT technique for gradient flow and extends it to handle the stochasticity in SGF using tools from stochastic calculus.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff08DMFT\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u591a\u8f6e\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08SGD\uff09\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff08SGF\uff09\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u7a0b\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u5c0f\u6279\u91cfSGD\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u591a\u8f6eSGD\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63cf\u8ff0\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff08SGF\uff09\u8fd1\u4f3c\u591a\u8f6eSGD\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\u6570n\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6d\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff08DMFT\uff09\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86SGF\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684DMFT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u5728\u7ebfSGD\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u7b49\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e3aSGD\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u5c0f\u6279\u91cfSGD\u9ad8\u7ef4\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DMFT\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u5904\u7406SGF\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in this domain, their precise causal estimation capabilities are still limited, and the impact of post-training on these abilities is insufficiently explored. This paper examines the extent to which post-training can enhance LLMs' capacity for causal inference. We introduce CauGym, a comprehensive dataset comprising seven core causal tasks for training and five diverse test sets. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate five post-training approaches: SFT, DPO, KTO, PPO, and GRPO. Across five in-domain and four existing benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that appropriate post-training enables smaller LLMs to perform causal inference competitively, often surpassing much larger models. Our 14B parameter model achieves 93.5% accuracy on the CaLM benchmark, compared to 55.4% by OpenAI o3.

In the two-agent setting with Gaussian noise and bounded valuations, we derive upper and lower bounds on the required number of queries for finding an envy-free allocation in terms of the number of items, $m$, and the negative-envy of the optimal allocation, $\u0394$. In particular, when $\u0394$ is not too small (namely, $\u0394\\gg m^{1/4}$), we establish that the optimal number of queries scales as $\\frac{\\sqrt m }{(\u0394/ m)^2} = \\frac{m^{2.5}}{\u0394^2}$ up to logarithmic factors.

However, with the increasing incorporation of ancillary services into power grids, a more comprehensive approach to energy management systems is required. Such an approach should not only optimize revenue generation from BESS but also ensure the safe, efficient, and reliable operation of lithium-ion batteries. This research seeks to bridge this gap by exploring literature that addresses both the economic and operational dimensions of BESS. Specifically, it examines how economic aspects of grid duty cycles can align with control schemes deployed in BESS systems. This alignment, or synergy, could be instrumental in creating robust digital twins virtual representations of BESS systems that enhance both grid stability and revenue potential.\n  The literature review is organized into five key categories: (1) ancillary services for BESS, exploring support functions that BESS can provide to power grids; (2) control systems developed for real-time BESS power flow management, ensuring smooth operations under dynamic grid conditions; (3) optimization algorithms for BESS dispatch, focusing on efficient energy allocation strategies; (4) techno-economic analyses of BESS and battery systems to assess their financial viability; and (5) digital twin technologies for real-world BESS deployments, enabling advanced predictive maintenance and performance optimization.

The results show that the proposed multiplicative architecture yields residual error structures that are more tightly aligned with regions of reduced regularity and exhibits more stable convergence in regularity-sensitive metrics.\n  These results demonstrate that adopting a multiplicative representation format has concrete implications for the localization and regularity behavior of neural network approximations, providing a direct connection between architectural design and analytical properties of the approximating functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u4e58\u6cd5\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u8868\u793a\u800c\u975e\u52a0\u6cd5\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8f85\u52a9\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u4e58\u6cd5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u903c\u8fd1\u5177\u6709\u5c16\u9510\u8fc7\u6e21\u5c42\u6216\u9ad8\u9636\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u70b9\u6001\u635f\u5931\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u5730\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4f4e\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e2d\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u6cd5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e58\u6cd5\u4ea4\u4e92\u901a\u5e38\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4ee5\u4e58\u6cd5\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u903c\u8fd1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u6027\u8d28\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e58\u6cd5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e58\u6cd5\u4ea4\u4e92\u6784\u6210\u57fa\u672c\u8868\u793a\u800c\u975e\u8f85\u52a9\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728Bessel\u52bf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u903c\u8fd1\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u5c16\u9510\u8fc7\u6e21\u5c42\u6216\u9ad8\u9636\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u70b9\u6001\u635f\u5931\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u654f\u611f\u91cf\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fZygmund\u578b\u534a\u8303\u6570\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u9762\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e58\u6cd5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u5728Bessel\u52bf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u52a0\u6cd5\u67b6\u6784\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e58\u6cd5\u67b6\u6784\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bef\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u5730\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982Zygmund\u578b\u534a\u8303\u6570\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e58\u6cd5\u8868\u793a\u683c\u5f0f\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u903c\u8fd1\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u5177\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u903c\u8fd1\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u6790\u6027\u8d28\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u4e58\u6cd5\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u5c16\u9510\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

While existing equivariant quantum machine learning models often rely on ad hoc constructions, HyQuRP is built upon the formal foundations of group representation theory. In the sparse-point regime, HyQuRP consistently outperforms strong classical and quantum baselines across multiple benchmarks. For example, when six subsampled points are used, HyQuRP ($\\sim$1.5K parameters) achieves 76.13% accuracy on the 5-class ModelNet benchmark, compared to approximately 71% for PointNet, PointMamba, and PointTransformer with similar parameter counts.

However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations small, deliberate input modifications that can degrade detection accuracy and compromise interpretability. This paper presents an empirical study of adversarial robustness and explainability drift across two cybersecurity domains phishing URL classification and network intrusion detection. We evaluate the impact of L (infinity) bounded Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) perturbations on model accuracy and introduce a quantitative metric, the Robustness Index (RI), defined as the area under the accuracy perturbation curve. Gradient based feature sensitivity and SHAP based attribution drift analyses reveal which input features are most susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Experiments on the Phishing Websites and UNSW NB15 datasets show consistent robustness trends, with adversarial training improving RI by up to 9 percent while maintaining clean-data accuracy. These findings highlight the coupling between robustness and interpretability degradation and underscore the importance of quantitative evaluation in the design of trustworthy, AI-driven cybersecurity systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6307\u6570(RI)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u9493\u9c7c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5165\u4fb5\u9884\u9632\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5fae\u5c0f\u4f46\u6709\u610f\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u4fee\u6539\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u635f\u5bb3\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6f02\u79fb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528L\u221e\u6709\u754c\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u68af\u5ea6\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5(FGSM)\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d(PGD)\u6270\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6307\u6570(RI)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u6027-\u6270\u52a8\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u7684\u9762\u79ef\uff1b3. \u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eSHAP\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u6f02\u79fb\u5206\u6790\uff1b4. \u5728\u9493\u9c7c\u7f51\u7ad9\u548cUNSW NB15\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b5. \u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u5c06RI\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe9%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u68af\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548cSHAP\u5f52\u56e0\u6f02\u79fb\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u54ea\u4e9b\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u6700\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u64cd\u7eb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u9000\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, they still recompute the attention and feed-forward blocks for every token position at every step -- even when many unmasked tokens are essentially fixed, resulting in substantial waste in compute. We propose SureLock: when the posterior at an unmasked position has stabilized across steps (our sure condition), we lock that position -- thereafter skipping its query projection and feed-forward sublayers -- while caching its attention keys and values so other positions can continue to attend to it. This reduces the dominant per-iteration computational cost from $O(N^2d)$ to $O(MNd)$ where $N$ is the sequence length, $M$ is the number of unlocked token positions, and $d$ is the model dimension. In practice, $M$ decreases as the iteration progresses, yielding substantial savings. On LLaDA-8B, SureLock reduces algorithmic FLOPs by 30--50% relative to the same sampler without locking, while maintaining comparable generation quality. We also provide a theoretical analysis to justify the design rationale of SureLock: monitoring only the local KL at the lock step suffices to bound the deviation in final token probabilities.

We propose DiSPO (Diffusion-State Policy Optimization), a plug-in credit-assignment layer that directly optimizes intermediate filling decisions. At selected intermediate masked states, DiSPO branches by resampling fillings for the currently masked positions from rollout-cached logits, scores the resulting completions, and updates only the newly filled tokens -- without additional multi-step diffusion rollouts. We formalize a fixed-state objective for branched completions and derive a policy-gradient estimator that can be combined with terminal-feedback policy optimization using the same rollouts. On LLaDA-8B-Instruct, DiSPO consistently improves over the terminal-feedback diffu-GRPO baseline on math and planning benchmarks under matched rollout compute and optimizer steps.

Motivated by recent results that residual wide-narrow-wide (hourglass) MLPs offer superior function approximation capabilities, we revisit the long-standing MLP shape convention in Transformer, challenging the necessity of the narrow-wide-narrow design. To study this, we develop a Transformer variant that replaces the conventional FFN with a deeper hourglass-shaped FFN, comprising a stack of hourglass sub-MLPs connected by residual pathways. We posit that a deeper but lighter hourglass FFN can serve as a competitive alternative to the conventional FFN, and that parameters saved by using a lighter hourglass FFN can be more effectively utilized, such as by enlarging model hidden dimensions under fixed budgets. We confirm these through empirical validations across model scales: hourglass FFNs outperform conventional FFNs up to 400M and achieve comparable performance at larger scales to 1B parameters; hourglass FFN variants with reduced FFN and increased attention parameters show consistent improvements over conventional configurations at matched budgets. Together, these findings shed new light on recent work and prompt a rethinking of the narrow-wide-narrow MLP convention and the balance between attention and FFN towards efficient and expressive modern language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86Transformer\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7a84-\u5bbd-\u7a84MLP\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u6df1\u7684\u6c99\u6f0f\u5f62\u72b6FFN\uff08\u5bbd-\u7a84-\u5bbd\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u6216\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u76f4\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u6bcf\u5c42\u5305\u542b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u7a84-\u5bbd-\u7a84MLP\u7684FFN\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u914d\u7ed9MLP\u4e14\u6269\u5c55\u6bd4\u57282-4\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6b8b\u5dee\u5bbd-\u7a84-\u5bbd\uff08\u6c99\u6f0f\uff09MLP\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6Transformer\u4e2dMLP\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u957f\u671f\u60ef\u4f8b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Transformer\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u7528\u66f4\u6df1\u7684\u6c99\u6f0f\u5f62\u72b6FFN\u66ff\u6362\u4f20\u7edfFFN\uff0c\u8be5FFN\u7531\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u5806\u53e0\u7684\u6c99\u6f0f\u5b50MLP\u7ec4\u6210\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u8f7b\u4f46\u66f4\u6df1\u7684\u6c99\u6f0fFFN\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edfFFN\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8282\u7701\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\uff08\u5982\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6269\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728400M\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0c\u6c99\u6f0fFFN\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfFFN\uff1b\u57281B\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u5f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u51cf\u5c11FFN\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6c99\u6f0fFFN\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u5339\u914d\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u914d\u7f6e\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u8fd1\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u7a84-\u5bbd-\u7a84MLP\u60ef\u4f8b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0eFFN\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Spaceborne LiDAR missions, including the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), provide global observations of forest structure but are spatially sparse and subject to inherent uncertainties. In contrast, near-surface LiDAR platforms, such as airborne and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR systems, offer much finer measurements of forest canopy structure, and a growing number of countries have made these datasets openly available. In this study, a state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation model, Depth Anything V2, was trained using approximately 16,000 km2 of canopy height models (CHMs) derived from publicly available airborne LiDAR point clouds and related products across multiple countries, together with 3 m resolution PlanetScope and airborne RGB imagery. The trained model, referred to as Depth2CHM, enables the estimation of spatially continuous CHMs directly from PlanetScope RGB imagery. Independent validation was conducted at sites in China (approximately 1 km2) and the United States (approximately 116 km2). The results showed that Depth2CHM could accurately estimate canopy height, with biases of 0.59 m and 0.41 m and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 2.54 m and 5.75 m for these two sites, respectively. Compared with an existing global meter-resolution CHM product, the mean absolute error is reduced by approximately 1.5 m and the RMSE by approximately 2 m.

However, the high numbers of security alerts issued by intrusion detection systems lead to alert fatigue among analysts working in security operations centres (SOC), which in turn causes slow reaction time and incorrect decision making. Alert grouping, which refers to clustering of security alerts according to their underlying causes, can significantly reduce the number of distinct items analysts have to consider. Unfortunately, conventional time-based alert grouping solutions are unsuitable for large scale computer networks characterised by high levels of false positive alerts and simultaneously occurring attacks. To address these limitations, we propose AlertBERT, a self-supervised framework designed to group alerts from isolated or concurrent attacks in noisy environments. Thereby, our open-source implementation of AlertBERT leverages masked-language-models and density-based clustering to support both real-time or forensic operation. To evaluate our framework, we further introduce a novel data augmentation method that enables flexible control over noise levels and simulates concurrent attack occurrences.

In the setting of one-dimensional fixed-time OLO on a bounded domain, it has been observed since Cover (1966) that achievable tradeoffs are governed by probabilistic inequalities, and these descriptive results can be converted into algorithms via dynamic programming, which, however, is not computationally efficient. We address this limitation by showing that Stein's method, a classical framework underlying the proofs of probabilistic limit theorems, can be operationalized as computationally efficient OLO algorithms. The associated regret and total loss upper bounds are \"additively sharp\", meaning that they surpass the conventional big-O optimality and match normal-approximation-based lower bounds by additive lower order terms. Our construction is inspired by the remarkably clean proof of a Wasserstein martingale central limit theorem (CLT) due to R\u00f6llin (2018).\n  Several concrete benefits can be obtained from this general technique. First, with the same computational complexity, the proposed algorithm improves upon the total loss upper bounds of online gradient descent (OGD) and multiplicative weight update (MWU). Second, our algorithm can realize a continuum of optimal two-point tradeoffs between the total loss and the maximum regret over comparators, improving upon prior works in parameter-free online learning.

Experiments show that NEC achieves high-fidelity reconstruction under substantial compression and effectively disentangles motion from skeletal structure.

In characteristic zero, the problem was solved by Hironaka in 1964, work for which he was awarded the Fields Medal. Modern proofs proceed by constructing suitable ranking functions, that is, invariants shown to strictly decrease along canonical sequences of blow-ups, ensuring termination. In positive characteristic, however, no such general ranking function is known: Frobenius-specific pathologies, such as the kangaroo phenomenon, can cause classical characteristic-zero invariants to plateau or even temporarily increase, presenting a fundamental obstruction to existing approaches. In this paper we report a sequence of experiments using the evolutionary search model AlphaEvolve, designed to discover candidate ranking functions for a toy canonical blow-up process. Our test benchmarks consist of carefully selected hypersurface singularities in dimension $4$ and characteristic $p=3$, with monic purely inseparable leading term, a regime in which naive order-based invariants often fail. After iteratively refining the experimental design, we obtained a discretized five-component lexicographic ranking function satisfying a bounded-delay descent criterion with zero violations across the benchmark. These experiments in turn motivated our main results: the conjectural delayed ranking functions in characteristic $3$ formulated in two conjectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528AlphaEvolve\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5f813\u76844\u7ef4\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u5947\u70b9\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b0\u5019\u9009\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u731c\u60f3\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b63\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5947\u70b9\u6d88\u89e3\u662f\u4ee3\u6570\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u7279\u5f81\u96f6\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6b63\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u56e0Frobenius\u7279\u5b9a\u75c5\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u888b\u9f20\u73b0\u8c61\uff09\u800c\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u963b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u6a21\u578bAlphaEvolve\u5728\u7279\u5f81p=3\u76844\u7ef4\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u5947\u70b9\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u5355\u9879\u7eaf\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9879\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7684\u4e94\u5206\u91cf\u5b57\u5178\u5e8f\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u6709\u754c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0b\u964d\u51c6\u5219\u7684\u4e94\u5206\u91cf\u5b57\u5178\u5e8f\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u96f6\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7279\u5f813\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\u731c\u60f3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81p\u7684\u5947\u70b9\u6d88\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u731c\u60f3\u4e3a\u6b63\u7279\u5f81\u5947\u70b9\u6d88\u89e3\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002"}}

We introduce Inference-Time Rethinking, a generative framework that enables iterative self-correction by decoupling declarative latent thought vectors from procedural generation. We factorize reasoning into a continuous latent thought vector (what to reason about) and a decoder that verbalizes the trace conditioned on this vector (how to reason). Beyond serving as a declarative buffer, latent thought vectors compress the reasoning structure into a continuous representation that abstracts away surface-level token variability, making gradient-based optimization over reasoning strategies well-posed. Our prior model maps unstructured noise to a learned manifold of valid reasoning patterns, and at test time we employ a Gibbs-style procedure that alternates between generating a candidate trace and optimizing the latent vector to better explain that trace, effectively navigating the latent manifold to refine the reasoning strategy. Training a 0.2B-parameter model from scratch on GSM8K, our method with 30 rethinking iterations surpasses baselines with 10 to 15 times more parameters, including a 3B counterpart.

Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) address these issues by iteratively expanding a restricted game with approximate best responses (BRs), yet per-agent BR training makes it prohibitively expensive in many-agent or simulator-expensive settings. We introduce Joint Experience Best Response (JBR), a drop-in modification to PSRO that collects trajectories once under the current meta-strategy profile and reuses this joint dataset to compute BRs for all agents simultaneously. This amortizes environment interaction and improves the sample efficiency of best-response computation. Because JBR converts BR computation into an offline RL problem, we propose three remedies for distribution-shift bias: (i) Conservative JBR with safe policy improvement, (ii) Exploration-Augmented JBR that perturbs data collection and admits theoretical guarantees, and (iii) Hybrid BR that interleaves JBR with periodic independent BR updates. Across benchmark multi-agent environments, Exploration-Augmented JBR achieves the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while Hybrid BR attains near-PSRO performance at a fraction of the sample cost. Overall, JBR makes PSRO substantially more practical for large-scale strategic learning while preserving equilibrium robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faJBR\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdbPSRO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u8054\u5408\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6240\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2dPSRO\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "PSRO\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f17\u591a\u6216\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u62df\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faJBR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u6536\u96c6\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\uff1b2\uff09\u91cd\u7528\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6240\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b3\uff09\u9488\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a\u4fdd\u5b88JBR\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u589e\u5f3aJBR\u548c\u6df7\u5408BR\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u589e\u5f3aJBR\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6df7\u5408BR\u4ee5\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u6210\u672c\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1PSRO\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0cJBR\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347PSRO\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6218\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "JBR\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u8054\u5408\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8PSRO\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6218\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5747\u8861\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Experiments show that SiTok outperforms strong baselines on understanding, reconstruction and generation tasks, at an extremely low token rate of $12.5$ Hz and a bit-rate of 200 bits-per-second.", "AI": {"tldr": "Speech Diffusion Tokenizer (SiTok) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u97f3\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u768412.5Hz\u4ee4\u724c\u7387\u548c200bps\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a(1) \u5728\u7f16\u7801\u8bed\u4e49\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\uff09\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e73\u8861\u6743\u8861\uff1b(2) \u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u4ee4\u724c\u7387\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpeech Diffusion Tokenizer (SiTok)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u97f3\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u523016\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728200\u4e07\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "SiTok\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u768412.5Hz\u4ee4\u724c\u7387\u548c200bps\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "SiTok\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5728\u8bed\u4e49-\u58f0\u5b66\u6743\u8861\u548c\u4f4e\u901f\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u8868\u793a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This trust has spurred research on poisoning attacks that craft malicious content, inject it into knowledge sources, and manipulate RAG responses. However, when evaluated in practical RAG systems, existing attacks suffer from severely degraded effectiveness. This gap stems from two overlooked realities: (i) content is often processed before use, which can fragment the poison and weaken its effect, and (ii) users often do not issue the exact queries anticipated during attack design. These factors can lead practitioners to underestimate risks and develop a false sense of security. To better characterize the threat to practical systems, we present Confundo, a learning-to-poison framework that fine-tunes a large language model as a poison generator to achieve high effectiveness, robustness, and stealthiness. Confundo provides a unified framework supporting multiple attack objectives, demonstrated by manipulating factual correctness, inducing biased opinions, and triggering hallucinations. By addressing these overlooked challenges, Confundo consistently outperforms a wide range of purpose-built attacks across datasets and RAG configurations by large margins, even in the presence of defenses.

Rather than relying on time reversal of a noising process, a reference diffusion is forced towards the target distribution by an exponential change of measure. Compared to existing methodology, this approach readily generalises to the infinite-dimensional setting, hence offering greater flexibility in the diffusion model. The construction is derived rigorously under verifiable conditions, and bounds with respect to the target measure are established.

HuMI enables robot-free data collection by capturing rich whole-body motion using portable hardware. This data drives a hierarchical learning pipeline that translates human motions into dexterous and feasible humanoid skills.

However, a critical gap exists: most datasets either offer a single, clean ground truth, which hides real-world expert disagreement, or they provide multiple annotations without a separate gold standard for objective evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce CytoCrowd, a new public benchmark for cytology analysis. The dataset features 446 high-resolution images, each with two key components: (1) raw, conflicting annotations from four independent pathologists, and (2) a separate, high-quality gold-standard ground truth established by a senior expert. This dual structure makes CytoCrowd a versatile resource. It serves as a benchmark for standard computer vision tasks, such as object detection and classification, using the ground truth. Simultaneously, it provides a realistic testbed for evaluating annotation aggregation algorithms that must resolve expert disagreements. We provide comprehensive baseline results for both tasks.

At variance with previous approaches, our QSA realizes the required nonlinearity through interference of state overlaps and returns a Renyi-1/2 cross-entropy loss directly as the expectation value of an observable, avoiding the need to decode amplitude-encoded predictions into classical logits. Furthermore, QSA naturally accommodates a constrained, trainable data-embedding that ties quantum state overlaps to data-level similarities. We find a gate complexity dominant scaling O(T d^2) for QSA, versus O(T^2 d) classically, suggesting an advantage in the practical regime where the sequence length T dominates the embedding size d. In simulations, we show that our QSA-based quantum transformer learns sequence prediction on classical data and on many-body transverse-field Ising quantum trajectories, establishing trainable attention as a practical primitive for quantum dynamical modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(QSA)\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u91cd\u53e0\u5e72\u6d89\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51faRenyi-1/2\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7ecf\u5178\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6T\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6d\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(T^2 d)\uff0c\u5f53\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6T\u5f88\u5927\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u632f\u5e45\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178logits\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(QSA)\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u91cd\u53e0\u5e72\u6d89\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\uff1b2) \u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51faRenyi-1/2\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u671f\u671b\u503c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u89e3\u7801\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u91cd\u53e0\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7ea7\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5173\u8054\uff1b4) \u95e8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3b\u8981\u7f29\u653e\u4e3aO(T d^2)\u3002", "result": "1) \u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aQSA\u5728T\u4e3b\u5bfcd\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b2) \u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eQSA\u91cf\u5b50transformer\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u7ecf\u5178\u6570\u636e\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u6a2a\u5411\u573aIsing\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b3) \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u539f\u8bed\u3002", "conclusion": "QSA\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50transformer\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u91cd\u53e0\u5e72\u6d89\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51fa\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, complex graph topologies and homophilic patterns can facilitate attribute inference attacks (AIAs) by enabling sensitive information leakage to propagate across local neighborhoods. Existing AIAs predominantly assume that adversaries can probe sensitive attributes through repeated model queries. Such assumptions are often impractical in real-world settings due to stringent data protection regulations, prohibitive query budgets, and heightened detection risks, especially when inferring multiple sensitive attributes. More critically, this model-centric perspective obscures a pervasive blind spot: \\textbf{intrinsic multiple sensitive information leakage arising solely from publicly released graphs.} To exploit this unexplored vulnerability, we introduce a new attack paradigm and propose \\textbf{Taipan, the first query-free transfer-based attack framework for multiple sensitive attribute inference attacks on graphs (G-MSAIAs).} Taipan integrates \\emph{Hierarchical Attack Knowledge Routing} to capture intricate inter-attribute correlations, and \\emph{Prompt-guided Attack Prototype Refinement} to mitigate negative transfer and performance degradation. We further present a systematic evaluation framework tailored to G-MSAIAs. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world graph datasets demonstrate that Taipan consistently achieves strong attack performance across same-distribution settings and heterogeneous similar- and out-of-distribution settings with mismatched feature dimensionalities, and remains effective even under rigorous differential privacy guarantees.

In this setting, we present a novel task embedding technique leveraging a new generation of semantic LTL-to-automata translations, originally developed for temporal synthesis. The resulting semantically labelled automata contain rich, structured information in each state that allow us to (i) compute the automaton efficiently on-the-fly, (ii) extract expressive task embeddings used to condition the policy, and (iii) naturally support full LTL. Experimental results in a variety of domains demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and is able to scale to complex specifications where existing methods fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49LTL\u5230\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u8bb0\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b8c\u6574LTL\u89c4\u8303\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u53ef\u80fd\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742LTL\u89c4\u8303\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u8bed\u4e49LTL\u5230\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u8f6c\u6362\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u8bb0\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b8c\u6574LTL\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5728\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49LTL\u5230\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u8303\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recent works have proposed a wide range of watermarking algorithms, each with distinct designs, usually built using a bottom-up approach. Crucially, there is no general and principled formulation for LLM watermarking.\n  In this work, we show that most existing and widely used watermarking schemes can in fact be derived from a principled constrained optimization problem. Our formulation unifies existing watermarking methods and explicitly reveals the constraints that each method optimizes. In particular, it highlights an understudied quality-diversity-power trade-off. At the same time, our framework also provides a principled approach for designing novel watermarking schemes tailored to specific requirements. For instance, it allows us to directly use perplexity as a proxy for quality, and derive new schemes that are optimal with respect to this constraint. Our experimental evaluation validates our framework: watermarking schemes derived from a given constraint consistently maximize detection power with respect to that constraint.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u6709LLM\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf-\u591a\u6837\u6027-\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u65b0\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u6c34\u5370\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5404\u5f02\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6c34\u5370\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u5bfc\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u4f7f\u7528\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d28\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ece\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u8be5\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u6700\u5927\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf-\u591a\u6837\u6027-\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aLLM\u6c34\u5370\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf-\u591a\u6837\u6027-\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e09\u65b9\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

We investigate fairness in TrSP through the lens of justified representation (JR) and the core, and uncover a structural correspondence with fair clustering. Specifically, we show that a constant-factor approximation to proportional fairness in clustering can be used to guarantee a constant-factor biparameterized approximation to core. We establish a lower bound of 1.366 on the approximability of JR, and moreover show that no clustering algorithm can approximate JR within a factor better than 3. Going beyond clustering, we propose the Expanding Cost Algorithm, which achieves a tight 2.414-approximation for JR, but does not give any bounded core guarantee. In light of this, we introduce a parameterized algorithm that interpolates between these approaches, and enables a tunable trade-off between JR and core.

However, that is an oversimplification that is unsuitable for representing the multifaceted spectrum of spontaneous emotional states, which are most often the result of a combination of multiple emotions contributing at different intensities. Building on this, a promising direction that was explored recently is to cast emotion recognition as a distribution learning problem. Still, such approaches are limited in that research datasets are typically annotated with a single emotion class. In this paper, we contribute a novel approach to describe complex emotional states as probability distributions over a set of emotion classes. To do so, we propose a solution to automatically re-label existing datasets by exploiting the result of a study in which a large set of both basic and compound emotions is mapped to probability distributions in the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) space. In this way, given a face image annotated with VAD values, we can estimate the likelihood of it belonging to each of the distributions, so that emotional states can be described as a mixture of emotions, enriching their description, while also accounting for the ambiguous nature of their perception. In a preliminary set of experiments, we illustrate the advantages of this solution and a new possible direction of investigation.

(2025), which accurately models the loss dynamics of both linear regression and large language model (LLM) pre-training. Within FSL, loss dynamics are governed by two exponents: a source exponent $s>0$ controlling the rate of signal learning, and a capacity exponent $\u03b2>1$ determining the rate of noise forgetting. Focusing on a fixed training horizon $N$, we derive the optimal LRSs and reveal a sharp phase transition. In the easy-task regime $s \\ge 1 - 1/\u03b2$, the optimal schedule follows a power decay to zero, $\u03b7^*(z) = \u03b7_{\\mathrm{peak}}(1 - z/N)^{2\u03b2- 1}$, where the peak learning rate scales as $\u03b7_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\eqsim N^{-\u03bd}$ for an explicit exponent $\u03bd= \u03bd(s,\u03b2)$. In contrast, in the hard-task regime $s < 1 - 1/\u03b2$, the optimal LRS exhibits a warmup-stable-decay (WSD) (Hu et al. (2024)) structure: it maintains the largest admissible learning rate for most of training and decays only near the end, with the decay phase occupying a vanishing fraction of the horizon.\n  We further analyze optimal shape-fixed schedules, where only the peak learning rate is tuned -- a strategy widely adopted in practiceand characterize their strengths and intrinsic limitations. This yields a principled evaluation of commonly used schedules such as cosine and linear decay. Finally, we apply the power-decay LRS to one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for kernel regression and show the last iterate attains the exact minimax-optimal rate, eliminating the logarithmic suboptimality present in prior analyses.

Prior work addresses this in two ways. Closed-set approaches mitigate biases in predefined fairness categories (e.g., gender, race), assuming socially salient minority attributes are known a priori. Open-set approaches frame the task as bias identification, highlighting majority attributes that dominate outputs. Both overlook a complementary task: uncovering rare or minority features underrepresented in the data distribution (social, cultural, or stylistic) yet still encoded in model representations. We introduce RAIGen, the first framework, to our knowledge, for un-supervised rare-attribute discovery in diffusion models. RAIGen leverages Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders and a novel minority metric combining neuron activation frequency with semantic distinctiveness to identify interpretable neurons whose top-activating images reveal underrepresented attributes.

Code and videos are available at https://sure-nav.github.io/", "summary": "We address the over-constrained planning problem in semi-static environments. The planning objective is to find a best-effort solution that avoids all hard constraint regions while minimally traversing the least risky areas. Conventional methods often rely on pre-defined area costs, limiting generalizations. Further, the spatial continuity of navigation spaces makes it difficult to identify regions that are passable without overestimation. To overcome these challenges, we propose SuReNav, a superpixel graph-based constraint relaxation and navigation method that imitates human-like safe and efficient navigation. Our framework consists of three components: 1) superpixel graph map generation with regional constraints, 2) regional-constraint relaxation using graph neural network trained on human demonstrations for safe and efficient navigation, and 3) interleaving relaxation, planning, and execution for complete navigation. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art baselines on 2D semantic maps and 3D maps from OpenStreetMap, achieving the highest human-likeness score of complete navigation while maintaining a balanced trade-off between efficiency and safety.

We propose \\textbf{RanSOM}, a unified framework that eliminates this bias by replacing deterministic step sizes with randomized steps drawn from distributions with mean $\u03b7_t$.

Despite this promise, many DL-HIMs stagnate at false fixed points where neural updates vanish while the physical residual remains large, raising questions about reliability in scientific computing. In this paper, we provide evidence that performance is highly sensitive to training paradigms and update strategies, even when the neural architecture is fixed. Through a detailed study of a DeepONet-based hybrid iterative numerical transferable solver (HINTS) and an FFT-based Fourier neural solver (FNS), we show that significant physical residuals can persist when training objectives are not aligned with solver dynamics and problem physics. We further examine Anderson acceleration (AA) and demonstrate that its classical form is ill-suited for nonlinear neural operators. To overcome this, we introduce physics-aware Anderson acceleration (PA-AA), which minimizes the physical residual rather than the fixed-point update. Numerical experiments confirm that PA-AA restores reliable convergence in substantially fewer iterations.

We formalize this phenomenon as cross-objective interference and conduct the first systematic study across classic scalarization algorithms, showing that interference is pervasive and exhibits strong model dependence.\n  To explain this phenomenon, we derive a local covariance law showing that an objective improves at first order when its reward exhibits positive covariance with the scalarized score. We extend this analysis to clipped surrogate objectives used in modern alignment, demonstrating that the covariance law remains valid under mild conditions despite clipping. Building on this analysis, we propose Covariance Targeted Weight Adaptation (CTWA), a plug-and-play method that maintains positive covariance between objective rewards and the training signal to effectively mitigate cross-objective interference.

In review at a conference", "summary": "Realistic sound propagation is essential for immersion in a virtual scene, yet physically accurate wave-based simulations remain computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. Wave coding methods address this limitation by precomputing and compressing impulse responses of a given scene into a set of scalar acoustic parameters, which can reach unmanageable sizes in large environments with many source-receiver pairs. We introduce Reciprocal Latent Fields (RLF), a memory-efficient framework for encoding and predicting these acoustic parameters. The RLF framework employs a volumetric grid of trainable latent embeddings decoded with a symmetric function, ensuring acoustic reciprocity. We study a variety of decoders and show that leveraging Riemannian metric learning leads to a better reproduction of acoustic phenomena in complex scenes. Experimental validation demonstrates that RLF maintains replication quality while reducing the memory footprint by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, a MUSHRA-like subjective listening test indicates that sound rendered via RLF is perceptually indistinguishable from ground-truth simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRLF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u7801\u58f0\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u542c\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u865a\u62df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u58f0\u4f20\u64ad\u5bf9\u6c89\u6d78\u611f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce2\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7cbe\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6ce2\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u538b\u7f29\u8109\u51b2\u54cd\u5e94\u4e3a\u58f0\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u578b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u8fc7\u5927\u96be\u4ee5\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RLF\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6f5c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4f53\u7d20\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u79f0\u51fd\u6570\u89e3\u7801\u786e\u4fdd\u58f0\u5b66\u4e92\u6613\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ece\u66fc\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u590d\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793aRLF\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u590d\u5236\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002\u4e3b\u89c2\u542c\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660eRLF\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "RLF\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u542c\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

A direct, model-free control design method based on the reinforcement learning framework is compared with an indirect optimal control design derived from a numerically identified mathematical model of the system. For the direct model-free approach, a policy iteration procedure is proposed, which adds an iteration layer called the epoch loop to gather multiple sets of process data, providing a more diverse dataset and helping reduce learning biases. This direct control design method is evaluated against a comparable optimal control solution designed from a plant model obtained through the combined Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc) and Prediction Error Minimization (PEM) system identification. Results show that while both controllers can stabilize and improve the performance of the magnetic levitation system when compared to controllers designed from a nominal model, the direct model-free approach consistently outperforms the indirect solution when multiple epochs are allowed. The iterative refinement of the optimal control law over the epoch loop provides the direct approach a clear advantage over the indirect method, which relies on a single set of system data to determine the identified model and control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u78c1\u60ac\u6d6e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u540e\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u78c1\u60ac\u6d6e\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u76f4\u63a5\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fa8\u8bc6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u8fed\u4ee3\u548cepoch\u5faa\u73af\u6536\u96c6\u591a\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\uff1b2) \u95f4\u63a5\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DMDc\u548cPEM\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u83b7\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u518d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u90fd\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u78c1\u60ac\u6d6e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5141\u8bb8\u591a\u6b21epoch\u8fed\u4ee3\u65f6\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u95f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u4f7f\u5176\u6bd4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u6b21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f4\u63a5\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u78c1\u60ac\u6d6e\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, modeling these world dynamics, especially for dexterous robotics tasks, poses significant challenges due to limited data coverage and scarce action labels. As an endeavor towards this end, we introduce DreamDojo, a foundation world model that learns diverse interactions and dexterous controls from 44k hours of egocentric human videos. Our data mixture represents the largest video dataset to date for world model pretraining, spanning a wide range of daily scenarios with diverse objects and skills. To address the scarcity of action labels, we introduce continuous latent actions as unified proxy actions, enhancing interaction knowledge transfer from unlabeled videos. After post-training on small-scale target robot data, DreamDojo demonstrates a strong understanding of physics and precise action controllability. We also devise a distillation pipeline that accelerates DreamDojo to a real-time speed of 10.81 FPS and further improves context consistency. Our work enables several important applications based on generative world models, including live teleoperation, policy evaluation, and model-based planning. Systematic evaluation on multiple challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks verifies the significance of our method for simulating open-world, contact-rich tasks, paving the way for general-purpose robot world models.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamDojo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece4.4\u4e07\u5c0f\u65f6\u4eba\u7c7b\u7b2c\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u7075\u5de7\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53d1\u5c55\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7075\u5de7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752844k\u5c0f\u65f6\u4eba\u7c7b\u7b2c\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u4ee3\u7406\u52a8\u4f5c\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u76ee\u6807\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a0\u901f\u84b8\u998f\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "DreamDojo\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u540e\u8fbe\u523010.81 FPS\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u901f\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aOOD\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5b9e\u65f6\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}
