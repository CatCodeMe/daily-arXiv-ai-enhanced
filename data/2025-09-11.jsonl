In this paper, we propose\npersonalized $w$-event privacy protection that allows different users to have\ndifferent privacy requirements in private data stream estimation. Specifically,\nwe design a mechanism that allows users to maintain constant privacy\nrequirements at each time slot, namely Personalized Window Size Mechanism\n(PWSM). Then, we propose two solutions to accurately estimate stream data\nstatistics while achieving $w$-event level $\\epsilon$ personalized differential\nprivacy ( ($w$, $\\epsilon$)-EPDP), namely Personalized Budget Distribution\n(PBD) and Peronalized Budget Absorption (PBA). PBD always provides at least the\nsame privacy budget for the next time step as the amount consumed in the\nprevious release. PBA fully absorbs the privacy budget from the previous $k$\ntime slots, while also borrowing from the privacy budget of the next $k$ time\nslots, to increase the privacy budget for the current time slot. We prove that\nboth PBD and PBA outperform the state-of-the-art private stream estimation\nmethods while satisfying the privacy requirements of all users. We demonstrate\nthe efficiency and effectiveness of our PBD and PBA on both real and synthetic\ndata sets, compared with the recent uniformity $w$-event approaches, Budget\nDistribution (BD) and Budget Absorption (BA). Our PBD achieves 68% less error\nthan BD on average on real data sets. Besides, our PBA achieves 24.9% less\nerror than BA on average on synthetic data sets."}

Existing literature on private FL analyzes\nprivacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching\nprovides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to\nsupply any additional desired privacy.\n  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which\ndirectly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy.

To enhance applicability in the presence of\nmultiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two\nmultivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously\nproposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance\ncovariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both\nregression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various\ntypes. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength,\nincluding a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies\ndissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups.

The replication of existing\nmethods in our experimental setup lead us to rethink the focus from enhancing\naggregation and domain adaptation methods to improving the feature extractors\nwithin the network itself. We propose replacing the FFREEDA backbone with a\nfrozen vision foundation model (VFM), thereby improving overall accuracy\nwithout extensive parameter tuning and reducing computational and communication\ncosts in federated learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that VFMs\neffectively mitigate the effects of domain gaps, class imbalances, and even\nnon-IID-ness among target clients, suggesting that strong feature extractors,\nnot complex adaptation or FL methods, are key to success in the real-world FL."}

We propose a method that labels log data\nwithout manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of\nanomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies\ninto three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,\nAnomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a\nflexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,\nand supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show\nF1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third\nlayer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,\ntheir origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying\nkey services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of\nroot cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable\ninsights for mitigation.

In\ncontrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and\nthat popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases\nfrom transferring.

Since the 1980s, categorizing the diversity of CDR\nstructures into canonical clusters has enabled the identification of key\nstructural motifs of antibodies. However, existing approaches have limited\ncoverage and cannot be readily incorporated into protein foundation models.\nHere we introduce ImmunoGlobulin LOOp Tokenizer, Igloo, a multimodal antibody\nloop tokenizer that encodes backbone dihedral angles and sequence. Igloo is\ntrained using a contrastive learning objective to map loops with similar\nbackbone dihedral angles closer together in latent space. Igloo can efficiently\nretrieve the closest matching loop structures from a structural antibody\ndatabase, outperforming existing methods on identifying similar H3 loops by\n5.9\\%. Igloo assigns tokens to all loops, addressing the limited coverage issue\nof canonical clusters, while retaining the ability to recover canonical loop\nconformations. To demonstrate the versatility of Igloo tokens, we show that\nthey can be incorporated into protein language models with IglooLM and\nIglooALM. On predicting binding affinity of heavy chain variants, IglooLM\noutperforms the base protein language model on 8 out of 10 antibody-antigen\ntargets. Additionally, it is on par with existing state-of-the-art\nsequence-based and multimodal protein language models, performing comparably to\nmodels with $7\\times$ more parameters. IglooALM samples antibody loops which\nare diverse in sequence and more consistent in structure than state-of-the-art\nantibody inverse folding models. Igloo demonstrates the benefit of introducing\nmultimodal tokens for antibody loops for encoding the diverse landscape of\nantibody loops, improving protein foundation models, and for antibody CDR\ndesign."}

However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the\nimplementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting\nstrategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic\nbiases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type\nI, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.\n  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks\nfrom 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.\nAnalyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure\nhow plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find\nincorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three\nhypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small\nlanguage models. While our findings show that higher task performance and\nbetter general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate\nmodels do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as\neffect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of\nfindings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking\nmitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in\nreducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,\ncommon regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in\nreducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.\n  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is\nunacceptably simple.
