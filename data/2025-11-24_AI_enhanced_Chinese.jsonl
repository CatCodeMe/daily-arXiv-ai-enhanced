We present an end-to-end pipeline combining automated data cleaning with LLM-driven SQL query generation, deployed on a production system managing 240,000 employee records over six months.\n  The system operates in two integrated stages: a multi-stage cleaning pipeline that performs translation normalization, spelling correction, and entity deduplication during periodic synchronization from Microsoft SQL Server to PostgreSQL; and a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by GPT-4o that translates natural-language questions in Turkish, Russian, and English into validated SQL queries. The query engine employs LangChain orchestration, FAISS vector similarity search, and few-shot learning with 500+ validated examples.\n  Our evaluation demonstrates 92.5% query validity, 95.1% schema compliance, and 90.7\\% semantic accuracy on 2,847 production queries. The system reduces query turnaround time from 2.3 days to under 5 seconds while maintaining 99.2% uptime, with GPT-4o achieving 46% lower latency and 68% cost reduction versus GPT-3.5.

This lack of structure challenges interoperability, making data integration, validation, and reuse difficult. LinkML (Linked Data Modeling Language) is an open framework that simplifies the process of authoring, validating, and sharing data. LinkML can describe a range of data structures, from flat, list-based models to complex, interrelated, and normalized models that utilize polymorphism and compound inheritance. It offers an approachable syntax that is not tied to any one technical architecture and can be integrated seamlessly with many existing frameworks. The LinkML syntax provides a standard way to describe schemas, classes, and relationships, allowing modelers to build well-defined, stable, and optionally ontology-aligned data structures. Once defined, LinkML schemas may be imported into other LinkML schemas. These key features make LinkML an accessible platform for interdisciplinary collaboration and a reliable way to define and share data semantics.\n  LinkML helps reduce heterogeneity, complexity, and the proliferation of single-use data models while simultaneously enabling compliance with FAIR data standards. LinkML has seen increasing adoption in various fields, including biology, chemistry, biomedicine, microbiome research, finance, electrical engineering, transportation, and commercial software development.

Isolation levels offer a configurable mechanism to manage the interaction between concurrent transactions, enabling varying degrees of consistency and performance trade-offs. These isolation guarantees are supported by all major RDBMSs. However, testing transaction behavior under different isolation levels remains a significant challenge due to two primary reasons. First, automatically generating test transactions that can effectively expose bugs in transaction handling logic is non-trivial, as such bugs are typically triggered under specific transactional constraints. Second, detecting logic anomalies in transaction outcomes is difficult because the correct execution results are often unknown for randomly generated transactions. To address these challenges, we propose an anomaly pattern-guided testing approach for uncovering transaction bugs in RDBMSs. Our solution tackles the first challenge by introducing a test case generation technique guided by predefined anomaly patterns, which increases the likelihood of exposing transactional bugs. For the second challenge, we present a two-phase detection process, involving explicit error detection and implicit error detection, to identify bugs in transaction execution. We have implemented our approach in a tool, APTrans, and evaluated it on three widely-used RDBMSs: MySQL, MariaDB, and OceanBase.

While deep learning has emerged as the dominant approach, several key challenges remain unresolved. First, sub-trajectory anomaly detection, capable of pinpointing the precise segments where anomalies occur, remains underexplored compared to whole-trajectory analysis. Second, many existing methods depend on carefully tuned thresholds, limiting their adaptability in real-world applications. Moreover, the irregular sampling of trajectory data and the presence of noise in training sets further degrade model performance, making it difficult to learn reliable representations of normal routes. To address these challenges, we propose a contrastive reinforcement learning framework for online trajectory anomaly detection, CroTad. Our method is threshold-free and robust to noisy, irregularly sampled data. By incorporating contrastive learning, CroTad learns to extract diverse normal travel patterns for different itineraries and effectively distinguish anomalous behaviours at both sub-trajectory and point levels. The detection module leverages deep reinforcement learning to perform online, real-time anomaly scoring, enabling timely and fine-grained identification of abnormal segments.

However, the dynamic nature of MoE leads to load imbalance among experts, severely impacting training efficiency. While previous research has attempted to address the load balancing challenge, existing solutions either compromise model accuracy or introduce additional system overhead. As a result, they fail to achieve fine-grained load balancing, which is crucial to optimizing training efficiency.\n  We propose MicroEP, a novel parallelization strategy to achieve fine-grained load balancing in MoE systems. MicroEP is capable of achieving optimal load balancing in every micro-batch through efficient token scheduling across GPUs. Furthermore, we propose MicroMoE, an efficient distributed MoE training system with MicroEP's load balancing capabilities.

As a result, Uplink MIMO (UL-MIMO) and Uplink Carrier Aggregation (UL-CA) have been widely deployed for the first time on commercial 5G networks. UL-MIMO enables the transmission of two data streams on one frequency band in strong RF conditions, theoretically doubling throughput and efficiency. On the other hand, UL-CA allows for simultaneous upload on greater channel widths, allowing more resources to be assigned to a single UE for higher throughput. In the United States, T-Mobile USA, a mobile network operator (MNO), has deployed network-wide 5G Standalone (SA), along with UL-MIMO on Time Division Duplex (TDD) band n41 and UL-CA between TDD and Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) NR bands. In this paper, the uplink throughput performance of UL-MIMO and UL-CA will be evaluated on the commercial T-Mobile 5G network on a variety of RF environments and modes of transportation. It was found that, even with the efficiency gains, UL-MIMO yields slower uplink throughput in most scenarios. However, in stronger RF conditions, UL-MIMO can provide an adequate user experience, so capacity can be conserved by reserving UL-CA for UE in weaker RF conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30T-Mobile 5G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4e0a\u884cMIMO\u548c\u4e0a\u884c\u8f7d\u6ce2\u805a\u5408\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e0a\u884cMIMO\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u8f83\u6162\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f3a\u5c04\u9891\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u8db3\u591f\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u5f31\u5c04\u9891\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0a\u884c\u8f7d\u6ce2\u805a\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u30014K/8K\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u3001\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u5165\u5bbd\u5e26\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u884cMIMO\u548c\u4e0a\u884c\u8f7d\u6ce2\u805a\u5408\u5728\u5546\u75285G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5546\u7528T-Mobile 5G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c04\u9891\u73af\u5883\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u884cMIMO\u548c\u4e0a\u884c\u8f7d\u6ce2\u805a\u5408\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u6548\u7387\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u4e0a\u884cMIMO\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u8f83\u6162\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u5f3a\u5c04\u9891\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0a\u884cMIMO\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u884cMIMO\u5728\u5f3a\u5c04\u9891\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u5f31\u5c04\u9891\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0a\u884c\u8f7d\u6ce2\u805a\u5408\u6765\u8282\u7ea6\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, designing diverse and physically realistic protein structure and surfaces that precisely complement target receptors remains a significant challenge in computational protein design. In this work, we introduce PepBridge, a novel framework for the joint design of protein surface and structure that seamlessly integrates receptor surface geometry and biochemical properties. Starting with a receptor surface represented as a 3D point cloud, PepBridge generates complete protein structures through a multi-step process. First, it employs denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) to map receptor surfaces to ligand surfaces. Next, a multi-model diffusion model predicts the corresponding structure, while Shape-Frame Matching Networks ensure alignment between surface geometry and backbone architecture. This integrated approach facilitates surface complementarity, conformational stability, and chemical feasibility.

We prove mathematically that combining agents with different detection patterns finds more bugs than any single agent when the agents look for different problems, confirmed by measuring agent correlation of p = 0.05--0.25. We also show that multiple vulnerabilities in the same code create exponentially more risk than previously thought--SQL injection plus exposed credentials creates 15x more danger (risk 300 vs. 20) than traditional models predict. Testing on 99 code samples with verified labels shows our system catches 76.1% of bugs, matching the best existing method while running faster and without test execution. We tested 15 different agent combinations and found that using multiple agents improves accuracy by 39.7 percentage points (from 32.8% to 72.4%) compared to single agents, with gains of +14.9pp, +13.5pp, and +11.2pp for agents 2, 3, and 4. The best two-agent combination reaches 79.3% accuracy.

The sensitivity of an algorithm $A$ on a graph $G$ is defined as the maximum Wasserstein distance between the output distributions of $A$ on $G$ and on $G - e$, where $G - e$ is the graph obtained by deleting an edge $e$ from $G$. The maximum is taken over all edges $e$, and the underlying metric for the Wasserstein distance is the Hamming distance.\n  We first show that for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a polynomial-time $(1 - \\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm with sensitivity $\u0394^{O(1/\\varepsilon)}$, where $\u0394$ is the maximum degree of the input graph. The algorithm is based on sampling from the Gibbs distribution over matchings and runs in time $O_{\\varepsilon, \u0394}(m \\log m)$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph. This result significantly improves the previously known sensitivity bounds.\n  Next, we present significantly faster algorithms for planar and bipartite graphs as a function of $\\varepsilon$ and $\u0394$, which run in time $\\mathrm{poly}(n/\\varepsilon)$. This improvement is achieved by designing a more efficient algorithm for sampling matchings from the Gibbs distribution in these graph classes, which improves upon the previous best in terms of running time.\n  Finally, for general graphs with potentially unbounded maximum degree, we show that there exists a polynomial-time $(1 - \\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm with sensitivity $\\sqrt{n} \\cdot (\\varepsilon^{-1} \\log n)^{O(1/\\varepsilon)}$, improving upon the previous best bound of $O(n^{1/(1+\\varepsilon^2)})$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4(1-\u03b5)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u7c7b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u5220\u9664\u4e00\u6761\u8fb9\u65f6\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u654f\u611f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5409\u5e03\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u3001\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u548c\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u5ea6\u4e3a\u0394\u7684\u56fe\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u4e3a\u0394^O(1/\u03b5)\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u548c\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\uff0c\u5f97\u5230poly(n/\u03b5)\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3a\u221an\u00b7(\u03b5^{-1}log n)^{O(1/\u03b5)}\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, accurately estimating flow frequencies is challenging due to the large number of flows and increasing network speeds.

Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety.\n  In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories.

In practice, network delay variation and recovery dynamics at the receiver distort this cadence even when transports deliver all packets correctly, which produces visible jitter, stalls, and unstable playback.\n  We present a lightweight receiver-side scheduling approach that regularizes release timing after recovery. The scheduler maintains an adaptive estimate of effective path delay and adjusts release times asymmetrically, responding quickly to late arrivals and only gradually to early ones. This upper-envelope behavior keeps release aligned with recent delay peaks and maintains smooth playback with minimal added latency. The scheduler runs entirely on the receiver clock and requires no feedback or synchronization.\n  As a concrete example, we integrate receiver-side scheduling into the BitRipple Tunnel (BRT) overlay, an application-layer software system that forwards traffic without altering the underlying transport protocol. Within BRT, the scheduler functions as an independent module that regulates delivery timing for forwarded objects.\n  Evaluating BRT with receiver-side scheduling on a cloud-gaming workload shows that the scheduler removes virtually all large jitter excursions and yields tightly clustered release intervals that improve visible smoothness. Broader latency improvements arise from the behavior of the full BRT overlay. Receiver-side scheduling can also be integrated modularly into transport stacks such as TCP, QUIC, WebRTC, UDP, or RTP, which are natural deployment points for future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u8c03\u6574\u91ca\u653e\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u7f51\u7edc\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6296\u52a8\u548c\u5361\u987f\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u6ed1\u64ad\u653e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u6e38\u620f\u3001XR\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u7b49\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u8282\u594f\u5230\u8fbe\uff0c\u4f46\u7f51\u7edc\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u6062\u590d\u52a8\u6001\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u8fd9\u79cd\u8282\u594f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u6296\u52a8\u3001\u5361\u987f\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u64ad\u653e\u3002", "method": "\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u7ef4\u62a4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u8c03\u6574\u91ca\u653e\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5230\u8fbe\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u524d\u5230\u8fbe\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u65f6\u949f\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u9988\u6216\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e91\u6e38\u620f\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u51e0\u4e4e\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u5927\u7684\u6296\u52a8\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7d27\u5bc6\u805a\u96c6\u7684\u91ca\u653e\u95f4\u9694\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u53ef\u89c1\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u8c03\u5ea6\u53ef\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u96c6\u6210\u5230TCP\u3001QUIC\u3001WebRTC\u3001UDP\u6216RTP\u7b49\u4f20\u8f93\u534f\u8bae\u6808\u4e2d\uff0c\u662f\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u90e8\u7f72\u70b9\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era. Our study is to systematically challenge the foundational assumption that structure is inherently beneficial for LLM-based graph reasoning, opening the door to new, semantics-driven approaches for graph learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8282\u70b9\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684LLMs\u5c31\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u8fb9\u9645\u6536\u76ca\u751a\u81f3\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u5728\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u4ee3\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u751a\u81f3\u9002\u5f97\u5176\u53cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdLLM\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u5fc5\u7136\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6a21\u677f\u5316\u56fe\u6a21\u677f\u548cGNN\u7f16\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8282\u70b9\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u5c31\u80fd\u5728\u5404\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u5f3a\u52b2\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fb9\u9645\u589e\u76ca\u6216\u8d1f\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u4e14\u6709\u65f6\u9002\u5f97\u5176\u53cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u5982\u4f55\u5728LLM\u65f6\u4ee3\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8f6c\u5411\u65b0\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9a71\u52a8\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The goal is to decide if a graph that forbids a fixed pattern $H$ as a subgraph contains a triangle, using only \"combinatorial\" methods that notably exclude fast matrix multiplication. Our work aims to classify which patterns admit a subcubic speedup, working towards a dichotomy theorem. On the lower bound side, we show that if $H$ is not $3$-colorable or contains more than one triangle, the complexity of the problem remains unchanged, and no combinatorial speedup is likely possible. On the upper bound side, we develop an embedding approach that results in a strongly subcubic, combinatorial algorithm for a rich class of \"embeddable\" patterns. Specifically, for an embeddable pattern of size $k$, our algorithm runs in $\\tilde O(n^{3-\\frac{1}{2^{k-3}}})$ time, where $\\tilde O(\\cdot)$ hides poly-logarithmic factors. This algorithm also extends to listing all the triangles within the same time bound. We supplement this main result with two generalizations: 1) A generalization to patterns that are embeddable up to a single obstacle that arises from a triangle in the pattern. This completes our classification for small patterns, yielding a dichotomy theorem for all patterns of size up to eight. 2) An $H$-sensitive algorithm for embeddable patterns, which runs faster when the number of copies of $H$ is significantly smaller than the maximum possible $\u03a9(n^k)$. Finally, we focus on the special case of odd cycles. We present specialized Triangle Detection algorithms that are very efficient: 1) A combinatorial algorithm for $C_{2k+1}$-free graphs that runs in $\\tilde O(m+n^{1+2/k})$ time for every $k\\geq2$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph. 2) A combinatorial $C_5$-sensitive algorithm that runs in $\\tilde O(n^2+n^{4/3}t^{1/3})$ time, where $t$ is the number of $5$-cycles in the graph.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7981\u6b62\u7279\u5b9a\u5b50\u56feH\u7684\u56fe\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u54ea\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5141\u8bb8\u4e9a\u4e09\u6b21\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef3\u7740\u8272\u6216\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e9a\u4e09\u6b21\u7ec4\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a\u00d5(n^{3-1/2^{k-3}})\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7981\u6b62\u7279\u5b9a\u5b50\u56feH\u7684\u56fe\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5206\u7c7b\u54ea\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5141\u8bb8\u4e9a\u4e09\u6b21\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f7f\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff0c\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u5efa\u7acb\u4e8c\u5206\u5b9a\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u7ec4\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a\u00d5(n^{3-1/2^{k-3}})\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5947\u6570\u73af\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982C_{2k+1}-free\u56fe\u7684\u00d5(m+n^{1+2/k})\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e0b\u754c\uff1a\u5982\u679cH\u4e0d\u53ef3\u7740\u8272\u6216\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\uff0c\u5219\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\uff1b\u4e0a\u754c\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e9a\u4e09\u6b21\u7ec4\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5947\u6570\u73af\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982C_5-sensitive\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a\u00d5(n^2+n^{4/3}t^{1/3})\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728H-free\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u53ef\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e9a\u4e09\u6b21\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5bf9\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc78\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u4e8c\u5206\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5947\u6570\u73af\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e13\u95e8\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This work introduces a new paradigm with a core objective: to perform fast, data-efficient, and high-fidelity RF reconstruction of occluded 3D static scenes, using only a single, brief human walk. We argue that this unstructured motion is not noise, but is in fact an information-rich signal available for reconstruction. To achieve this, we design a factorization framework based on composite 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that learns to model the dynamic effects of human motion from the persistent static scene geometry within a raw RF stream. Trained on just a single 60-second casual walk, our model reconstructs the full static scene with a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.96, remarkably outperforming heavily-sampled state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 12%.

However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees.

Objective: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable potential in SVA, they still face two major limitations. First, most LLMs are trained on general-purpose corpora and thus lack domain-specific knowledge essential for effective SVA. Second, they tend to rely on shallow pattern matching instead of deep contextual reasoning, making it challenging to fully comprehend complex code semantics and their security implications. Method: To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel framework ReVul-CoT that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Chain-of-Thought (COT) prompting. In ReVul-CoT, the RAG module dynamically retrieves contextually relevant information from a constructed local knowledge base that consolidates vulnerability data from authoritative sources (such as NVD and CWE), along with corresponding code snippets and descriptive information. Building on DeepSeek-V3.1, CoT prompting guides the LLM to perform step-by-step reasoning over exploitability, impact scope, and related factors Results: We evaluate ReVul-CoT on a dataset of 12,070 vulnerabilities. Experimental results show that ReVul-CoT outperforms state-of-the-art SVA baselines by 16.50%-42.26% in terms of MCC, and outperforms the best baseline by 10.43%, 15.86%, and 16.50% in Accuracy, F1-score, and MCC, respectively.

A standard assumption is that clusters induce well-connected subgraphs (i.e. $\u03a9(1)$-expanders), and form $\u03b5$-sparse cuts. Such a graph defines the clustering uniquely up to $\\approx \u03b5$ misclassification rate, and efficient algorithms for achieving this rate are known. While this vanilla version of graph clustering is well studied, in practice, vertices of the graph are typically equipped with labels that provide additional information on cluster ids of the vertices. For example, each vertex could have a cluster label that is corrupted independently with probability $\u03b4$. Using only one of the two sources of information leads to misclassification rate $\\min\\{\u03b5, \u03b4\\}$, but can they be combined to achieve a rate of $\\approx \u03b5\u03b4$?\n  In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to this question and present a sublinear-time algorithm in the number of vertices $n$. Our key algorithmic insight is a new observation on ``spectrally ambiguous'' vertices in a well-clusterable graph.\n  While our sublinear-time classifier achieves the nearly optimal $\\approx \\widetilde O(\u03b5\u03b4)$ misclassification rate, the approximate clusters that it outputs do not necessarily induce expanders in the graph $G$.

A common criticism of blockchain networks has been their energy consumption and operational costs. The switch from Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol has significantly reduced this issue, though concerns remain, especially with network expansions via additional layers. The ERC-4337 standard is a recent proposal that facilitates end-user access to Ethereum-backed applications. It introduces a middleware called a bundler, operated as a third-party service, where part of its operational cost is represented by its power consumption. While bundlers have served over 500 million requests in the past two years, fewer than 15 official bundler providers exist, compared to over 100 regular Ethereum access providers. In this paper, we provide a first look at the active power consumption overhead that a bundler would add to an Ethereum access service.

Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs. Experiments on multiple MLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that FlashCache outperforms state-of-the-art multimoal KV compression methods, achieving up to 1.69 times faster decoding with 80% lower KV memory usage while maintaining task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlashCache\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5f02\u5e38KV\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u504f\u79bb\u4e3b\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u5f02\u5e38KV\u5bf9\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11KV\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u968f\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u6838\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u4eceKV\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u5e03\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u9891\u57df\u80fd\u91cf\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u3002\u63d0\u51faFlashCache\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5f02\u5e38KV\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u9891\u57df\u5efa\u6a21KV\u77e9\u9635\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u4fdd\u7559\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bb\u7684KV\u5bf9\uff1b2\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u5c42KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5927\u5c0f\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u66f4\u591a\u5f02\u5e38KV\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMLLM\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlashCache\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe1.69\u500d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u52a0\u901f\u548c80%\u7684KV\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FlashCache\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f02\u5e38KV\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present UI-CUBE (UiPath Computer Use BEnchmark), a systematic benchmark comprising 226 tasks across two difficulty tiers designed to expose fundamental architectural limitations in current CUAs. Our evaluation covers simple UI interactions (136 tasks) and complex workflows including copy-paste tasks (50 tasks) and enterprise application scenarios (40 tasks), with systematic interface variation coverage, multi-resolution testing and automated validation of task success through the application state. Evaluation of five state-of-the-art models reveals a sharp capability cliff rather than gradual performance degradation. Simple UI interactions achieve 67-85% success rates (compared to 97.9% human performance), but complex workflows drop precipitously to 9-19%. Human evaluators with no prior application experience achieve only 61.2% on complex tasks despite near-perfect performance on simple tasks, establishing realistic performance ceilings. This discontinuous performance pattern -- where agents achieve 68-87% of human performance on simple tasks but only 15-32% on complex workflows -- indicates fundamental architectural limitations in memory management, hierarchical planning, and state coordination rather than incremental capability gaps addressable through better training or prompting. UI-CUBE functions as an enterprise-readiness diagnostic, revealing that while current CUAs can manipulate individual interface elements, they cannot yet function as reliable workflow automation tools.

ReqSketch (arXiv:2004.01668) is currently the most space-efficient summary with two key properties: relative error guarantees, offering increasingly higher accuracy towards the distribution's tails, and mergeability, allowing distributed or parallel processing of datasets. Due to these features and its simple algorithm design, ReqSketch has been adopted in practice, via implementation in the Apache DataSketches library. However, the proof of mergeability in ReqSketch is overly complicated, requiring an intricate charging argument and complex variance analysis.\n  In this paper, we provide a refined version of ReqSketch, by developing so-called adaptive compactors. This enables a significantly simplified proof of relative error guarantees in the most general mergeability setting, while retaining the original space bound, update time, and algorithmic simplicity.

While this iff constraint aligns with many real-world applications, recent work has shown that most deep learning-based MIL approaches violate it, leading to inflated performance metrics and poor generalization. We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation. This work offers a principled, interpretable, and effective alternative to existing MIL approaches that rely on learned heuristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5411\u91cf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784(VSA)\u7684\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u4ee3\u6570\u8fd0\u7b97\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801MIL\u7684iff\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683cMIL\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60MIL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u8fdd\u53cdiff\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u865a\u9ad8\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faaMIL\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528VSA\u5c06\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u8fd1\u6b63\u4ea4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u6570\u8fd0\u7b97\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u65f6\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884ciff\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aVSA\u517c\u5bb9\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6MIL\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6709\u6548MIL\u6a21\u578b\u7684SOTA\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faaMIL\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b66\u4e60\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684MIL\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

It enables developers to implement function-level tasks, i.e., serverless functions, without managing infrastructure. While reducing operational overhead, it poses challenges, especially for novice developers. Developing functions from scratch requires adapting to heterogeneous, platform-specific programming styles, making the process time-consuming and error-prone. Function reuse offers a promising solution to address these challenges. However, research on serverless computing lacks a dedicated approach for function recommendation. Existing techniques from traditional contexts remain insufficient due to the semantic gap between task descriptions and heterogeneous function implementations. Advances in large language models (LLMs), pre-trained on large-scale corpora, create opportunities to bridge this gap by aligning developer requirements with function semantics.\n  This paper presents SlsReuse, the first LLM-powered framework for serverless function reuse. Specifically, SlsReuse first constructs a reusable function repository serving as a foundational knowledge base. Then, it learns unified semantic-enhanced representations of heterogeneous functions through effective prompt engineering with few-shot prompting, capturing implicit code intent, target platforms, programming languages, and cloud services. Finally, given a natural language task query, SlsReuse performs intent-aware discovery combined with a multi-level pruning strategy and similarity matching. We evaluate SlsReuse on a curated dataset of 110 task queries.

Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity. In this study, We classify large-scale IoT attacks by utilizing the CICIoT2023 dataset.

Repeating all performance measurements after every revision is a cost-intensive task, especially in the presence of configurability, where one has to measure multiple configurations to obtain a comprehensive picture. Configuration sampling is a common approach to control the measurement cost. However, it cannot guarantee completeness and might miss performance regressions, especially if they only affect few configurations. As an alternative to solve the cost reduction problem, we present ConfFLARE: ConfFLARE estimates whether a change potentially impacts performance by identifying data-flow interactions with performance-relevant code and extracts which software features participate in such interactions. Based on these features, we can select a subset of relevant configurations to focus performance profiling efforts on. In a study conducted on both, synthetic and real-world software systems, ConfFLARE correctly detects performance regressions in almost all cases and identifies relevant features in all but two cases, reducing the number of configurations to be tested on average by $79\\%$ for synthetic and by $70\\%$ for real-world regression scenarios saving hours of performance testing time.", "AI": {"tldr": "ConfFLARE\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u53d8\u66f4\u662f\u5426\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u53c2\u4e0e\u6b64\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u914d\u7f6e\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6d4b\u8bd5\u914d\u7f6e\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u6d4b\u91cf\u591a\u4e2a\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u914d\u7f6e\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9057\u6f0f\u4ec5\u5f71\u54cd\u5c11\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u56de\u5f52\u3002", "method": "ConfFLARE\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u53d8\u66f4\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u914d\u7f6e\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cConfFLARE\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6b63\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u6027\u80fd\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5728\u9664\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u5916\u7684\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u914d\u7f6e\u6570\u91cf\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1179%\uff08\u5408\u6210\uff09\u548c70%\uff08\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff09\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "ConfFLARE\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u53d8\u66f4\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u6027\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6240\u9700\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7ef4\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

ManifoldFormer addresses this limitation through a novel geometric deep learning framework that explicitly learns neural manifold representations. The architecture integrates three key innovations: a Riemannian VAE for manifold embedding that preserves geometric structure, a geometric Transformer with geodesic-aware attention mechanisms operating directly on neural manifolds, and a dynamics predictor leveraging neural ODEs for manifold-constrained temporal evolution. Extensive evaluation across four public datasets demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with 4.6-4.8% higher accuracy and 6.2-10.2% higher Cohen's Kappa, while maintaining robust cross-subject generalization.

This forms an attractive proposition, since then AI agents can be used to reason about voluminous code that gets generated by AI.\n  In this work, we present a first LLM agent, AutoRocq, for conducting program verification. Unlike past works, which rely on extensive training of LLMs on proof examples, our agent learns on-the-fly and improves the proof via an iterative refinement loop. The iterative improvement of the proof is achieved by the proof agent communicating with the Rocq (formerly Coq) theorem prover to get additional context and feedback. The final result of the iteration is a proof derivation checked by the Rocq theorem prover. In this way, our proof construction involves autonomous collaboration between the proof agent and the theorem prover. This autonomy facilitates the search for proofs and decision-making in deciding on the structure of the proof tree.\n  Experimental evaluation on SV-COMP benchmarks and on Linux kernel modules shows promising efficacy in achieving automated program verification. As automation in code generation becomes more widespread, we posit that our proof agent can be potentially integrated with AI coding agents to achieve a generate and validate loop, thus moving closer to the vision of trusted automatic programming.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoRocq\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u4e0eRocq\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u9700\u8981AI\u4ee3\u7406\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6bd4\u4e00\u822c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u5177\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0eRocq\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u901a\u4fe1\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u5728SV-COMP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cLinux\u5185\u6838\u6a21\u5757\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoRocq\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0eAI\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u53ef\u4fe1\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u613f\u666f\u3002"}}

Despite the impressive performance of these architectures, a systematic approach to empirically analyze model performance and efficiency under various settings is not well established in the medical domain. The performances of six sequence models were investigated across three architecture classes (Transformers, Transformers++, Mambas) in a large Swedish heart failure (HF) cohort (N = 42820), providing a clinically relevant case study. Patient data included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratories, medications and procedures extracted from in-hospital EHRs. The models were evaluated on three one-year prediction tasks: clinical instability (a readmission phenotype) after initial HF hospitalization, mortality after initial HF hospitalization and mortality after latest hospitalization. Ablations account for modifications of the EHR-based input patient sequence, architectural model configurations, and temporal preprocessing techniques for data collection. Llama achieves the highest predictive discrimination, best calibration, and showed robustness across all tasks, followed by Mambas. Both architectures demonstrate efficient representation learning, with tiny configurations surpassing other large-scaled Transformers. At equal model size, Llama and Mambas achieve superior performance using 25% less training data.

This study explores SATD in SSW repositories, comparing SATD in scientific versus general-purpose open-source software and evaluating transformer-based models for SATD identification. We analyzed SATD in 27 scientific and general-purpose repositories across multiple domains and languages. We fine-tuned and compared 10 transformer-based models (100M-7B parameters) on 67,066 labeled code comments. SSW contains 9.25x more Scientific Debt and 4.93x more SATD than general-purpose software due to complex computations, domain constraints, and evolving research needs. Furthermore, our best model outperforms existing ones. This study uncovers how SATD in SSW differs from general software, revealing its impact on quality and scientific validity.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a general UQ framework that provides statistically valid guarantees, which is especially useful in practice. However, prior ordinal CP methods mainly focus on heuristic algorithms or restrictively require the underlying model to predict a unimodal distribution over ordinal labels. Consequently, they provide limited insight into coverage-efficiency trade-offs, or a model-agnostic and distribution-free nature favored by CP methods. To this end, we fill this gap by propose an ordinal-CP method that is model-agnostic and provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals. Specifically, we formulate conformal ordinal classification as a minimum-length covering problem at the instance level. To solve this problem, we develop a sliding-window algorithm that is optimal on each calibration data, with only a linear time complexity in K, the number of label candidates. The local optimality per instance further also improves predictive efficiency in expectation. Moreover, we propose a length-regularized variant that shrinks prediction set size while preserving coverage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets from diverse domains are conducted to demonstrate the significantly improved predictive efficiency of the proposed methods over baselines (by 15% decrease on average over four datasets).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u5206\u7c7b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e8f\u6570\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8981\u6c42\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u5cf0\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u8986\u76d6\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e5f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e8f\u6570\u5206\u7c7b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6700\u5c0f\u957f\u5ea6\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\u4ee5\u7f29\u5c0f\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8615%\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Building on prior work at Ericsson, which utilized a two-stage workflow, comprising Initial Retrieval (IR) and Re-Ranking (RR) stages, this study investigates different TR observation criteria and their impact on the performance of retrieval models. We propose \\textbf{CREST} (\\textbf{C}riteria-specific \\textbf{R}etrieval via \\textbf{E}nsemble of \\textbf{S}pecialized \\textbf{T}R models), a criterion-driven retrieval approach that leverages specialized models for different TR fields to improve both effectiveness and interpretability, thereby enabling quicker fault resolution and supporting software maintenance. CREST utilizes specialized models trained on specific TR criteria and aggregates their outputs to capture diverse and complementary signals. This approach leads to enhanced retrieval accuracy, better calibration of predicted scores, and improved interpretability by providing relevance scores for each criterion, helping users understand why specific TRs were retrieved. Using a subset of Ericsson's internal TRs, this research demonstrates that criterion-specific models significantly outperform a single model approach across key evaluation metrics. This highlights the importance of all targeted criteria used in this study for optimizing the performance of retrieval systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CREST\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6545\u969c\u62a5\u544a\u5b57\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u4fe1\u884c\u4e1a\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u6545\u969c\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u7ed9\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "CREST\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6545\u969c\u62a5\u544a\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u96c6\u6210\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7231\u7acb\u4fe1\u5185\u90e8\u6545\u969c\u62a5\u544a\u5b50\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5173\u952e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u51c6\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0cCREST\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5f97\u5206\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

This study focuses on Homarus gammarus (European lobster), a key species for fisheries and aquaculture, and leverages non-invasive Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM). Understanding lobster habitats, welfare, reproduction, sex, and age is crucial for management and conservation. While bioacoustic emissions have classified various aquatic species using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, this research specifically uses H. gammarus bioacoustics (buzzing/carapace vibrations) to classify lobsters by age (juvenile/adult) and sex (male/female).\n  The dataset was collected at Johnshaven, Scotland, using hydrophones in concrete tanks. We explored the efficacy of Deep Learning (DL) models (1D-CNN, 1D-DCNN) and six Machine Learning (ML) models (SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP). Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were used as features.\n  For age classification (adult vs. juvenile), most models achieved over 97% accuracy (Naive Bayes: 91.31%). For sex classification, all models except Naive Bayes surpassed 93.23%. These strong results demonstrate the potential of supervised ML and DL to extract age- and sex-related features from lobster sounds.

To address this question in the auditory domain, we quantified the alignment between the internal representations of 36 different audio models and brain activity from two independent fMRI datasets. Using voxel-wise and component-wise regression, and representation similarity analysis (RSA), we found that recent self-supervised audio models with strong performance in diverse downstream tasks are better predictors of auditory cortex activity than older and more specialized models. To assess the quality of the audio representations, we evaluated these models in 6 auditory tasks from the HEAREval benchmark, spanning music, speech, and environmental sounds. This revealed strong positive Pearson correlations ($r>0.7$) between a model's overall task performance and its alignment with brain representations. Finally, we analyzed the evolution of the similarity between audio and brain representations during the pretraining of EnCodecMAE.

The use of vocal biomarkers to support the early diagnosis of PD presents a non-invasive, low-cost, and accessible alternative in clinical settings. Thus, the objective of this cross-sectional study was to consistently evaluate the effectiveness of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in distinguishing individuals with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls, in comparison with traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, using vocal biomarkers. Two publicly available voice datasets were used. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted from the samples, and model robustness was assessed using a validation strategy with 1000 independent random executions. Performance was evaluated using classification statistics. Since normality assumptions were not satisfied, non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni post-hoc tests) were applied to verify whether the tested classification models were similar or different in the classification of PD. With an average accuracy of $98.65\\%$ and $92.11\\%$ on the Italian Voice dataset and Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, respectively, the DNN demonstrated superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional ML models, while also achieving competitive results when benchmarked against relevant studies.

Existing approaches extend this range through continuous-time dynamics or dense self-attention, but both suffer from high computational cost and limited scalability. We propose Topologic Attention Networks, a new framework that applies topologic attention, a probabilistic mechanism that learns how information should flow through both direct and indirect connections in a graph. Unlike conventional attention that depends on explicit pairwise interactions, topologic attention emerges from the learned information propagation of the graph, enabling unified reasoning over local and global relationships. This method achieves provides state-of-the-art performance across all measured baseline models.

Current LLM selection methods typically optimize for a single fixed objective, such as performance, cost, or a trade-off between them, and fail to learn individual user preferences from interaction data. To address these limitations, we propose PersonalizedRouter, a graph-based framework that models diverse user profiles and performs personalized LLM selection by leveraging interaction data that includes task context, queries, candidate LLMs, and user decisions. To capture contextual information between user queries and optimal LLMs, PersonalizedRouter converts the interaction data into a heterogeneous graph, where the relationships between different types of nodes are represented by edges. To evaluate adaptability across users, we design two strategies: the multi-cost-efficiency simulation strategy and the LLM-as-a-Judge strategy. In addition, we construct PersonaRoute-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with 1,000 simulated users and 10 LLMs. Experimental results show that PersonalizedRouter significantly outperforms existing LLM selection methods and surpasses the strongest methods by a large margin of 15.38% and 9.83% under two simulation strategies. On the PersonaRoute-Bench with 1,000 users, it further surpasses the best methods by 16.19% and 59.69% while maintaining higher efficiency.

Therefore, in order to find the best modeling approach, we have experimented with traditional, neural network and ensemble learning methods. We observe that ensemble learning methods outperform traditional and neural network models based on standard regression metrics.

Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints.

We present an end-to-end classification pipeline to address these issues. We train a latent ODE to model continuous ECG waveforms and create robust feature vectors from high-frequency single-channel signals. We construct three latent vectors per waveform via downsampling the initial 360 Hz ECG to 90 Hz and 45 Hz. We then use a gradient boosted tree to classify these vectors and test robustness across frequencies. Performance shows minimal degradation, with macro-averaged AUC-ROC values of 0.984, 0.978, and 0.976 at 360 Hz, 90 Hz, and 45 Hz, respectively, suggesting a way to sidestep the trade-off between signal fidelity and battery life.

Manual claim drafting is labor-intensive, costly, and inherently inconsistent, while conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the structured, iterative reasoning essential for precise claim refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce Tree of Claims (ToC), an innovative framework that redefines claim editing as a guided search problem. ToC synergistically integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system, comprising an LLM-based EditorAgent that proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent that mimics patent examiner critiques through structured, chain-of-thought analyses of novelty and prior art disclosure. Driven by a carefully designed multi-objective reward function, ToC jointly optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark of 1145 claims demonstrates that ToC significantly outperforms standard LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving an average composite score improvement of 8\\%, and up to 9\\% in certain cases. Extensive experiments, including detailed ablation studies, validate ToC's efficacy in generating superior, legally robust claim revisions. Overall, ToC establishes a transparent, controllable, and interpretable methodology that effectively bridges advanced LLM reasoning capabilities with strategic MCTS planning for structured patent claim optimization.The source code is available at https://github.com/ysy2003/ToC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Tree of Claims (ToC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e13\u5229\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408MCTS\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u4fee\u8ba2\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e13\u5229\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u8d77\u8349\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u4f18\u5316", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22(MCTS)\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u63d0\u51fa\u7f16\u8f91\u7684EditorAgent\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u4e13\u5229\u5ba1\u67e5\u5458\u6279\u5224\u7684ExaminerAgent\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3001\u8303\u56f4\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027", "result": "\u57281145\u4e2a\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cToC\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6LLM\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u7efc\u5408\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u53478%\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe9%", "conclusion": "ToC\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6218\u7565\u6027MCTS\u89c4\u5212\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e13\u5229\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u4f18\u5316"}}

Despite their practical success, theoretically understanding the gradient descent dynamics for training DEQs remains an area of active research. In this work, we rigorously study the gradient descent dynamics for DEQs in the simple setting of linear models and single-index models, filling several gaps in the literature. We prove a conservation law for linear DEQs which implies that the parameters remain trapped on spheres during training and use this property to show that gradient flow remains well-conditioned for all time. We then prove linear convergence of gradient descent to a global minimizer for linear DEQs and deep equilibrium single-index models under appropriate initialization and with a sufficiently small step size.

Training these models is computationally intensive, and centralizing the process raises significant data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling alternative, but existing Federated Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) methods face severe communication bottlenecks as their reliance on transmitting multiple gradients to a server is unscalable for large models. We introduce FIRM (Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective alignment), a novel algorithm that achieves both client disagreement drift mitigation and communication efficiency. In FIRM, each client locally solves a regularized multi-objective optimization problem. By directly mitigating client disagreement drift through in-client regularization, our method eliminates the need for the multi-gradient transmissions common in prior works. Consequently, clients need only to transmit a single set of adapted parameters, maintaining high communication efficiency. We prove that our algorithm converges to Pareto-stationary points and, to our knowledge, provide the first finite-time convergence guarantees for this federated multi-objective alignment setting. Empirically, we show that FIRM leads to smoother training dynamics, reduced client disagreement drift, and improved reward trade-offs compared to baselines. We further propose a method to incorporate a preference over the objectives and report empirical Pareto plots, demonstrating that FIRM can smoothly adapt trade-offs between objectives in response to specified preferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "FIRM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5185\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5206\u6b67\u6f02\u79fb\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f20\u8f93\u591a\u4e2a\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u51b2\u7a81\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5e2e\u52a9\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u5bb3\u6027\uff09\u3002", "method": "FIRM\u7b97\u6cd5\u8ba9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5728\u672c\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5185\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u76f4\u63a5\u7f13\u89e3\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5206\u6b67\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u4f20\u8f93\u5355\u7ec4\u9002\u5e94\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "FIRM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5206\u6b67\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u5956\u52b1\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u504f\u597d\u5e73\u6ed1\u8c03\u6574\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "FIRM\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Although time-series provide rich discriminative information, they also contain substantial redundancy, such as steady-state machine operation records and zero-output periods of solar power generation. Such redundancy diminishes the attention given to discriminative timestamps in representation learning, thus leading to performance bottlenecks in MTS clustering. Masking has been widely adopted to enhance the MTS representation, where temporal reconstruction tasks are designed to capture critical information from MTS. However, most existing masking strategies appear to be standalone preprocessing steps, isolated from the learning process, which hinders dynamic adaptation to the importance of clustering-critical timestamps. Accordingly, this paper proposes the Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC) method, with its model architecture composed of Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) and Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) representation learning modules. IVM adaptively guides the model in learning more discriminative representations for clustering, while the MEV-based reconstruction and contrastive learning pathways enhance the generalization. That is, the MEV reconstruction facilitates multi-perspective complementary to prevent the masking from premature convergence, and the clustering-guided contrastive learning facilitates the joint optimization of representation and clustering. Extensive experiments on 15 real benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of EMTC in comparison with eight SOTA methods, where the EMTC achieves an average improvement of 4.85% over the strongest baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEMTC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u7a33\u6001\u673a\u5668\u8fd0\u884c\u8bb0\u5f55\u3001\u96f6\u8f93\u51fa\u65f6\u6bb5\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5197\u4f59\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u5224\u522b\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u7c7b\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEMTC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u53d8\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\uff08IVM\uff09\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MEV\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u3002IVM\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5177\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u8868\u793a\uff0cMEV\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u572815\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEMTC\u4f18\u4e8e8\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53474.85%\u3002", "conclusion": "EMTC\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MTS\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations.

While data cleaning is commonly applied as a separate preprocessing stage, such two-stage pipelines neither fully exploit feedback from the downstream model nor adapt to unknown noise patterns. We propose Step-E, a simple framework that integrates sample selection and model learning into a single optimization process. At each epoch, Step-E ranks samples by loss and gradually increases the fraction of high-loss examples that are excluded from gradient updates after a brief warm-up stage, yielding an online curriculum that focuses on easy and consistent examples and eventually ignores persistent outliers. On CIFAR-100N, Step-E improves the test accuracy of a ResNet-18 model from 43.3% (+/- 0.7%) to 50.4% (+/- 0.9%), clearly outperforming loss truncation, self-paced learning, and one-shot filtering while approaching the clean-label oracle at 60.5% (+/- 0.2%).

Recent work finds that language models can use tools in ways that contradict the interests or explicit instructions of the user. We study LLM whistleblowing: a subset of this behavior where models disclose suspected misconduct to parties beyond the dialog boundary (e.g., regulatory agencies) without user instruction or knowledge. We introduce an evaluation suite of diverse and realistic staged misconduct scenarios to assess agents for this behavior. Across models and settings, we find that: (1) the frequency of whistleblowing varies widely across model families, (2) increasing the complexity of the task the agent is instructed to complete lowers whistleblowing tendencies, (3) nudging the agent in the system prompt to act morally substantially raises whistleblowing rates, and (4) giving the model more obvious avenues for non-whistleblowing behavior, by providing more tools and a detailed workflow to follow, decreases whistleblowing rates. Additionally, we verify the robustness of our dataset by testing for model evaluation awareness, and find that both black-box methods and probes on model activations show lower evaluation awareness in our settings than in comparable previous work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u4e3e\u62a5\u884c\u4e3a\u2014\u2014\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u7ecf\u7528\u6237\u6307\u793a\u6216\u77e5\u60c5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fb9\u754c\u5916\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u62ab\u9732\u53ef\u7591\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u4ee3\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u4ee5\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f53\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdd\u80cc\u7528\u6237\u5229\u76ca\u6216\u660e\u786e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5411\u5916\u90e8\u62ab\u9732\u53ef\u7591\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e3e\u62a5\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u5316\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u4e3e\u62a5\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u9053\u5fb7\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3e\u62a5\u9891\u7387\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u800c\u5f02\uff1b\u589e\u52a0\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u4e3e\u62a5\u503e\u5411\uff1b\u9053\u5fb7\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e3e\u62a5\u7387\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u8be6\u7ec6\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e3e\u62a5\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u4e3e\u62a5\u884c\u4e3a\u53d7\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u8fd9\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients (\"retain-invariant\"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects.

Long-term satellite-based LST records, such as those derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are essential for detecting climate trends. However, the coarse spatial resolution of AVHRR's global area coverage (GAC) data limit their utility for analyzing fine-scale permafrost dynamics and other surface processes in the Arctic. This paper presents a new 42 years pan-Arctic LST dataset, downscaled from AVHRR GAC to 1 km with a super-resolution algorithm based on a deep anisotropic diffusion model. The model is trained on MODIS LST data, using coarsened inputs and native-resolution outputs, guided by high-resolution land cover, digital elevation, and vegetation height maps. The resulting dataset provides twice-daily, 1 km LST observations for the entire pan-Arctic region over four decades. This enhanced dataset enables improved modelling of permafrost, reconstruction of near-surface air temperature, and assessment of surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

Code to be released upon full publication", "summary": "Sampling useful three-dimensional molecular structures along with their most favorable conformations is a key challenge in drug discovery. Current state-of-the-art 3D de-novo design flow matching or diffusion-based models are limited to generating a single conformation. However, the conformational landscape of a molecule determines its observable properties and how tightly it is able to bind to a given protein target. By generating a representative set of low-energy conformers, we can more directly assess these properties and potentially improve the ability to generate molecules with desired thermodynamic observables. Towards this aim, we propose FlexiFlow, a novel architecture that extends flow-matching models, allowing for the joint sampling of molecules along with multiple conformations while preserving both equivariance and permutation invariance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the QM9 and GEOM Drugs datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in molecular generation tasks. Our results show that FlexiFlow can generate valid, unstrained, unique, and novel molecules with high fidelity to the training data distribution, while also capturing the conformational diversity of molecules. Moreover, we show that our model can generate conformational ensembles that provide similar coverage to state-of-the-art physics-based methods at a fraction of the inference time.

SAVeD addresses a common challenge in data science of repeated labor due to a difficulty of similar work or transformations on datasets. SAVeD employs a modified SimCLR pipeline, generating augmented table views through random transformations (e.g., row deletion, encoding perturbations). These views are embedded via a custom transformer encoder and contrasted in latent space to optimize semantic similarity. Our model learns to minimize distances between augmented views of the same dataset and maximize those between unrelated tables. We evaluate performance using validation accuracy and separation, defined respectively as the proportion of correctly classified version/non-version pairs on a hold-out set, and the difference between average similarities of versioned and non-versioned tables (defined by a benchmark, and not provided to the model). Our experiments span five canonical datasets from the Semantic Versioning in Databases Benchmark, and demonstrate substantial gains post-training. SAVeD achieves significantly higher accuracy on completely unseen tables in, and a significant boost in separation scores, confirming its capability to distinguish semantically altered versions.

However, conventional prompt tuning methods are prone to overfitting and can struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. To address these limitations, Bayesian prompt learning has been proposed, which frames prompt optimization as a Bayesian inference problem to enhance robustness. This paper introduces Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL), a novel method for Bayesian prompt learning, designed to efficiently explore the complex and often multimodal posterior landscape of prompts. Our method integrates a cyclical step-size schedule with a stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm, enabling alternating phases of exploration to discover new modes, and exploitation to refine existing modes. Furthermore, we introduce a repulsive force derived from a potential function over probability metrics (including Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) computed on the distributions of representations produced by different prompts. This representation-space repulsion diversifies exploration and prevents premature collapse to a single mode. Our approach allows for a more comprehensive characterization of the prompt posterior distribution, leading to improved generalization. In contrast to prior Bayesian prompt learning methods, our method provides a modular plug-and-play Bayesian extension of any existing prompt learning method based on maximum likelihood estimation.

While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies. After reinforcement learning, our policy achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world graph structures and consistently outperforms the policy directly trained on the test graphs by the existing game RL approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u9c81\u68d2\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ffd\u6355\u7b56\u7565\uff08R2PS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fdd\u6301\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u56fe\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u9003\u907f\u8005\u9884\u6d4b\u8ffd\u6355\u8005\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8ffd\u6355\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8bc1\u660e\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u6b65\u79fb\u52a8\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fdd\u6301\u673a\u5236\u6269\u5c55DP\u7b56\u7565\u5230\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5c06\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fdd\u6301\u5d4c\u5165EPG\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u56fe\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6e38\u620fRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "R2PS\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ffd\u6355\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u56fe\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning. Yet, existing frequent or discriminative subgraph mining approaches often suffer from redundant multi-phase pipelines, high computational cost, and weak coupling between mined structures and their discriminative relevance. We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy.

While such objectives shape first- and second-order statistics of the representation, they largely ignore the local geometry of the underlying data manifold. In this paper, we introduce CurvSSL, a curvature-regularized self-supervised learning framework, and its RKHS extension, kernel CurvSSL. Our approach retains a standard two-view encoder-projector architecture with a Barlow Twins-style redundancy-reduction loss on projected features, but augments it with a curvature-based regularizer. Each embedding is treated as a vertex whose $k$ nearest neighbors define a discrete curvature score via cosine interactions on the unit hypersphere; in the kernel variant, curvature is computed from a normalized local Gram matrix in an RKHS. These scores are aligned and decorrelated across augmentations by a Barlow-style loss on a curvature-derived matrix, encouraging both view invariance and consistency of local manifold bending. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with a ResNet-18 backbone show that curvature-regularized SSL yields competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to Barlow Twins and VICReg.

MVDPDPSR is an extension of the vehicle routing problem and a spatio-temporal system optimization problem, widely applied in scenarios such as on-demand delivery. Classical operations research methods face bottlenecks in computational complexity and time efficiency when handling large-scale dynamic problems. Although existing reinforcement learning methods have achieved some progress, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Independent decoding across multiple vehicles fails to model joint action distributions; 2) The feature extraction network struggles to capture inter-entity relationships; 3) The joint action space is exponentially large. To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration.

While recent prompt-based methods perform strongly in class-incremental settings, they remain vulnerable under domain shifts, where the input distribution changes but the label space remains fixed. This exposes a persistent problem known as representation drift. Shared representations evolve in ways that overwrite previously useful features and cause forgetting even when prompts isolate task-specific parameters. To address this issue, we introduce InTAct, a method that preserves functional behavior in shared layers without freezing parameters or storing past data. InTAct captures the characteristic activation ranges associated with previously learned tasks and constrains updates to ensure the network remains consistent within these regions, while still allowing for flexible adaptation elsewhere. In doing so, InTAct stabilizes the functional role of important neurons rather than directly restricting parameter values.

Submitted to Computers in Biology and Medicine", "summary": "Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is a cornerstone in biomolecular analysis, offering precise identification of pathogens through unique mass spectral signatures. Yet, its reliance on labor-intensive sample preparation and multi-shot spectral averaging restricts its use to laboratory settings, rendering it impractical for real-time environmental monitoring. These limitations are especially pronounced in emerging aerosol MALDI-MS systems, where autonomous sampling generates noisy spectra for unknown aerosol analytes, requiring single-shot detection for effective analysis. Addressing these challenges, we propose the Mass Spectral Dictionary-Guided Transformer (MS-DGFormer): a data-driven framework that redefines spectral analysis by directly processing raw, minimally prepared mass spectral data. MS-DGFormer leverages a transformer architecture, designed to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in these time-series spectra. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce a novel dictionary encoder that integrates denoised spectral information derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), enabling the model to discern critical biomolecular patterns from single-shot spectra with robust performance. This innovation provides a system to achieve superior pathogen identification from aerosol samples, facilitating autonomous, real-time analysis in field conditions.

To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes.

While the growing availability of small open-source models and inference engines has lowered the entry barrier, users now face an overwhelming number of configuration choices. Identifying an optimal configuration -- balancing functional and non-functional requirements -- requires substantial manual effort. While several benchmarks target LLM inference, they are designed for narrow evaluation goals and not user-focused. They fail to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics into a unified, easy-to-use benchmark that supports multiple inference engines, usage scenarios, and quantization levels. To address this gap, we present Bench360 -- Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360\u00b0. Bench360 allows users to easily define their own custom tasks along with datasets and relevant task-specific metrics and then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server). Bench360 tracks a wide range of metrics, including (1) system metrics -- such as Computing Performance (e.g., latency, throughput), Resource Usage (e.g., energy per query), and Deployment (e.g., cold start time) -- and (2) task-specific metrics such as ROUGE, F1 score or accuracy. We demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks -- General Knowledge & Reasoning, QA, Summarization and Text-to-SQL -- across three hardware platforms and four state of the art inference engines. Our results reveal several interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, highlighting the differences in inference engines and models. Most importantly, there is no single best setup for local inference, which strongly motivates the need for a framework such as Bench360.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Bench360\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u672c\u5730LLM\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u5730\u8fd0\u884c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u6237\u9762\u4e34\u5927\u91cf\u914d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u72ed\u7a84\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1Bench360\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9009\u62e9\u7684LLM\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5355\u6d41\u3001\u6279\u5904\u7406\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7b49\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1LLM\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u4e09\u4e2a\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5730\u63a8\u7406\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u4f73\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f3a\u70c8\u9700\u8981\u50cfBench360\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u505a\u51fa\u660e\u667a\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

We find this trade-off stems from rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts toward single, predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure. To address this, we propose a proximity-aware approach: redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. We introduce SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that applies this principle of minimal intervention. SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. To support more rigorous evaluation, we also contribute NSFW-Caps, a new benchmark of 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift.

These attacks may pose significant privacy risks to individuals whose sensitive data were used for training, which motivates the use of defenses such as differential privacy, often at the cost of high accuracy losses. MIAs exploit the differences in the behavior of a model when making predictions on samples it has seen during training (members) versus those it has not seen (non-members). Several studies have pointed out that model overfitting is the major factor contributing to these differences in behavior and, consequently, to the success of MIAs. However, the literature also shows that even non-overfitted ML models can leak information about a small subset of their training data. In this paper, we investigate the root causes of membership inference vulnerabilities beyond traditional overfitting concerns and suggest targeted defenses. We empirically analyze the characteristics of the training data samples vulnerable to MIAs in models that are not overfitted (and hence able to generalize). Our findings reveal that these samples are often outliers within their classes (e.g., noisy or hard to classify).

However, they often require inner-loop iterations to solve the lower-level (LL) problem and small outer-loop step sizes to handle the increased smoothness induced by large penalty terms, leading to suboptimal complexity. This work considers the general BLO problems with coupled constraints (CCs) and leverages a novel penalty reformulation that decouples the upper- and lower-level variables. This yields an improved analysis of the smoothness constant, enabling larger step sizes and reduced iteration complexity for Penalty-Based Gradient Descent algorithms in ALTernating fashion (ALT-PBGD). Building on the insight of reduced smoothness, we propose PBGD-Free, a novel fully single-loop algorithm that avoids inner loops for the uncoupled constraint BLO. For BLO with CCs, PBGD-Free employs an efficient inner-loop with substantially reduced iteration complexity. Furthermore, we propose a novel curvature condition describing the \"flatness\" of the upper-level objective with respect to the LL variable. This condition relaxes the traditional upper-level Lipschitz requirement, enables smaller penalty constant choices, and results in a negligible penalty gradient term during upper-level variable updates. We provide rigorous convergence analysis and validate the method's efficacy through hyperparameter optimization for support vector machines and fine-tuning of large language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5c42\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u80fd\u591f\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6b65\u957f\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1aALT-PBGD\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u5355\u5faa\u73af\u7684PBGD-Free\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u66f2\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u653e\u677e\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684Lipschitz\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5185\u5faa\u73af\u8fed\u4ee3\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0b\u5c42\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u9700\u8981\u5c0f\u6b65\u957f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4f18\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u91cd\u6784\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5c42\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51faALT-PBGD\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u5355\u5faa\u73af\u7684PBGD-Free\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u66f2\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0a\u5c42\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u4e0b\u5c42\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\"\u5e73\u5766\u6027\"\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5e38\u6570\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6b65\u957f\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u66f2\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8026\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

BITS for GAPS supports serial hybrid modeling, where known physics governs part of the system and residual dynamics are represented as a latent function inferred from data. A Gaussian process prior is placed over the latent function, with hierarchical priors on its hyperparameters to encode physically meaningful structure in the predictive posterior.\n  To guide data acquisition, we derive entropy-based acquisition functions that quantify expected information gain from candidate input locations, identifying samples most informative for training the surrogate. Specifically, we obtain a closed-form expression for the differential entropy of the predictive posterior and establish a tractable lower bound for efficient evaluation. These derivations approximate the predictive posterior as a finite, uniformly weighted mixture of Gaussian processes.\n  We demonstrate the framework's utility by modeling activity coefficients in vapor-liquid equilibrium systems, embedding the surrogate into extended Raoult's law for distillation design. Numerical results show that entropy-guided sampling improves sample efficiency by targeting regions of high uncertainty and potential information gain. This accelerates surrogate convergence, enhances predictive accuracy in non-ideal regimes, and preserves physical consistency.

Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic.

In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art inverse problem solvers.

However, applying it to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm. Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers.

The timely and accurate detection of these diseases from plant leaf images is critical to mitigating their adverse effects. Deep neural network Ensembles (Deep Ensembles) have emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of diverse Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, selecting high-performing ensemble member models is challenging due to the inherent difficulty in measuring ensemble diversity. In this paper, we introduce the Synergistic Diversity (SQ) framework to enhance plant disease detection accuracy. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of existing ensemble diversity metrics (denoted as Q metrics), which often fail to identify optimal ensemble teams. Second, we present the SQ metric, a novel measure that captures the synergy between ensemble members and consistently aligns with ensemble accuracy. Third, we validate our SQ approach through extensive experiments on a plant leaf image dataset, which demonstrates that our SQ metric substantially improves ensemble selection and enhances detection accuracy.

However, most existing ML-based methods rely on large, accurately labeled datasets with location information, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. This paper proposes a generative framework to recover location labels directly from sequences of sparse channel state information (CSI) measurements, without explicit location labels for radio map construction. Instead of directly storing raw CSI, we learn a compact low-dimensional radio map embedding and leverage a generative model to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI. Specifically, to address the uncertainty of sparse CSI, a dual-scale feature extraction scheme is designed to enhance feature representation by jointly exploiting correlations from angular space and across neighboring samples. We develop a hybrid recurrent-convolutional encoder to learn mobility patterns, which combines a truncation strategy and multi-scale convolutions in the recurrent neural network (RNN) to ensure feature robustness against short-term fluctuations. Unlike conventional Gaussian priors in latent space, we embed a learnable radio map to capture the location information by encoding high-level positional features from CSI measurements. Finally, a diffusion-based generative decoder reconstructs the full CSI with high fidelity by conditioning on the positional features in the radio map. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can improve localization accuracy by over 30% and achieve a 20% capacity gain in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios compared with model-based Kalman filter approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u7a00\u758fCSI\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u5373\u53ef\u6784\u5efa\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5faa\u73af\u5377\u79ef\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574CSI\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eML\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5e26\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u7a00\u758fCSI\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6848\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6df7\u5408\u5faa\u73af\u5377\u79ef\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u6355\u83b7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u5efaCSI\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad830%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u76ca\u8fbe\u523020%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4ece\u7a00\u758fCSI\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Submitted to Computational and Applied Mathematics (Springer)", "summary": "Discrete fuzzy numbers, and in particular those defined over a finite chain $L_n = \\{0, \\ldots, n\\}$, have been effectively employed to represent linguistic information within the framework of fuzzy systems. Research on total (admissible) orderings of such types of fuzzy subsets, and specifically those belonging to the set $\\mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\\rightarrow Y_m}$ consisting of discrete fuzzy numbers $A$ whose support is a closed subinterval of the finite chain $L_n = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and whose membership values $A(x)$, for $x \\in L_n$, belong to the set $Y_m = \\{ 0 = y_1 < y_2 < \\cdots < y_{m-1} < y_m = 1 \\}$, has facilitated the development of new methods for constructing logical connectives, based on a bijective function, called $\\textit{pos function}$, that determines the position of each $A \\in \\mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\\rightarrow Y_m}$. For this reason, in this work we revisit the problem by introducing algorithms that exploit the combinatorial structure of total (admissible) orders to compute the $\\textit{pos}$ function and its inverse with exactness. The proposed approach achieves a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^{2} m \\log n)$, which is quadratic in the size of the underlying chain ($n$) and linear in the number of membership levels ($m$). The key point is that the dominant factor is $m$, ensuring scalability with respect to the granularity of membership values. The results demonstrate that this formulation substantially reduces computational cost and enables the efficient implementation of algebraic operations -- such as aggregation and implication -- on the set of discrete fuzzy numbers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u79bb\u6563\u6a21\u7cca\u6570\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u9006\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(n\u00b2m log n)\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f7f\u79bb\u6563\u6a21\u7cca\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u8fd0\u7b97\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u6563\u6a21\u7cca\u6570\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5168\u5e8f\u5173\u7cfb\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u63a5\u8bcd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u9006\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5e8f\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u9006\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(n\u00b2m log n)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dn\u662f\u5e95\u5c42\u94fe\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\uff0cm\u662f\u96b6\u5c5e\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f7f\u79bb\u6563\u6a21\u7cca\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u8fd0\u7b97\uff08\u5982\u805a\u5408\u548c\u8574\u542b\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u9006\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6a21\u7cca\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u8fd0\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

By design, PQCs create hybrid quantum-classical models, but their practical applicability remains uncertain due to training instabilities, barren plateaus (BPs), and the difficulty of isolating the contribution of individual pipeline components. In this work, we dissect PQC based QRL architectures through a systematic experimental evaluation of three aspects recurrently identified as critical: (i) data embedding strategies, with Data Reuploading (DR) as an advanced approach; (ii) ansatz design, particularly the role of entanglement; and (iii) post-processing blocks after quantum measurement, with a focus on the underexplored Output Reuse (OR) technique. Using a unified PPO-CartPole framework, we perform controlled comparisons between hybrid and classical agents under identical conditions. Our results show that OR, though purely classical, exhibits distinct behaviour in hybrid pipelines, that DR improves trainability and stability, and that stronger entanglement can degrade optimisation, offsetting classical gains. Together, these findings provide controlled empirical evidence of the interplay between quantum and classical contributions, and establish a reproducible framework for systematic benchmarking and component-wise analysis in QRL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def(PQC)\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(QRL)\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5d4c\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u3001ansatz\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8f93\u51fa\u91cd\u7528(OR)\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u72ec\u7279\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u4e0a\u4f20(DR)\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "PQC-QRL\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u8d2b\u7620\u9ad8\u539f(BPs)\u4ee5\u53ca\u96be\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684PPO-CartPole\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u5d4c\u5165\u7b56\u7565(\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u4e0a\u4f20DR)\u3001ansatz\u8bbe\u8ba1(\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7ea0\u7f20\u4f5c\u7528)\u548c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757(\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8f93\u51fa\u91cd\u7528OR\u6280\u672f)\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1aOR\u867d\u7136\u662f\u7eaf\u7ecf\u5178\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u72ec\u7279\u884c\u4e3a\uff1bDR\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u53ef\u80fd\u62b5\u6d88\u7ecf\u5178\u6536\u76ca\u5e76\u635f\u5bb3\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aQRL\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

While extensive research has explored the use of supervised Machine Learning for attack detection and characterisation, these methods require accurately labelled datasets, which are very costly to obtain. Moreover, existing public datasets have limited and/or outdated attacks, and many of them suffer from mislabelled data. To reduce the reliance on labelled data, we propose AutoGraphAD, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a Heterogeneous Variational Graph Autoencoder. AutoGraphAD operates on heterogeneous graphs, made from connection and IP nodes that capture network activity within a time window. The model is trained using unsupervised and contrastive learning, without relying on any labelled data. The reconstruction, structural loss, and KL divergence are then weighted and combined in an anomaly score that is then used for anomaly detection. Overall, AutoGraphAD yields the same, and in some cases better, results than previous unsupervised approaches, such as Anomal-E, but without requiring costly downstream anomaly detectors.

Although prior work exploits weight dependent MAC power for compression, existing methods often use global activation models, coarse energy proxies, or layer-agnostic policies, which limits their effectiveness on real hardware. We propose an energy aware, layer-wise compression framework that explicitly leverages MAC and layer level energy characteristics. First, we build a layer-aware MAC energy model that combines per-layer activation statistics with an MSB-Hamming distance grouping of 22-bit partial sum transitions, and integrate it with a tile-level systolic mapping to estimate convolution-layer energy. On top of this model, we introduce an energy accuracy co-optimized weight selection algorithm within quantization aware training and an energy-prioritized layer-wise schedule that compresses high energy layers more aggressively under a global accuracy constraint.

This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib.

While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards.

Existing methods lack the causal reasoning and multimodal understanding required for reliable generalization. We introduce $\\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$, a large-scale dataset and benchmark that couples Sentinel-2 imagery and climate data with expert-defined risk rasters across the USA, and real wildfire events in Europe for cross-continental evaluation. Building on this dataset, we propose $\\textbf{FireScope}$, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from both reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces. When trained in the USA and tested in Europe, $\\textbf{FireScope}$ achieves substantial performance gains, while expert feedback and automated analysis confirm that its reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability.

While deterministic models such as FuXi, GraphCast, and SFNO have achieved competitive forecast skill relative to numerical weather prediction, their ability to represent uncertainty and capture extremes is still limited. This study investigates how state of the art deterministic artificial intelligence based models respond to initial-condition perturbations and evaluates the resulting ensembles in forecasting extremes. Using three perturbation strategies (Gaussian noise, Hemispheric Centered Bred Vectors, and Huge Ensembles), we generate 50 member ensembles for two major events in August 2022: the Pakistan floods and the China heatwave. Ensemble skill is assessed against ERA5 and compared with IFS ENS and the probabilistic AIFSENS model using deterministic and probabilistic metrics. Results show that flow dependent perturbations produce the most realistic ensemble spread and highest probabilistic skill, narrowing but not closing the performance gap with numerical weather prediction ensembles. Across variables, artificial intelligence based weather models capture temperature extremes more effectively than precipitation. These findings demonstrate that input perturbations can extend deterministic models toward probabilistic forecasting, paving the way for approaches that combine flow dependent perturbations with generative or latent-space uncertainty modeling for reliable artificial intelligence-driven early warning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u6270\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9AI\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6d41\u4f9d\u8d56\u6270\u52a8\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f46AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u62a5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u964d\u6c34\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027AI\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6355\u6349\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u6270\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u7387\u6027\u9884\u62a5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u6270\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u534a\u7403\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7e41\u6b96\u5411\u91cf\u3001\u5927\u96c6\u5408\uff09\u4e3a2022\u5e748\u6708\u7684\u5df4\u57fa\u65af\u5766\u6d2a\u6c34\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u70ed\u6d6a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u751f\u621050\u4e2a\u6210\u5458\u7684\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eIFS ENS\u548cAIFSENS\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6d41\u4f9d\u8d56\u6270\u52a8\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1bAI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u62a5\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6982\u7387\u6027\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u4f9d\u8d56\u6270\u52a8\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6216\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u53ef\u9760AI\u9a71\u52a8\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Unlike prior work that uses these features in isolation or buried within complex architectures, we systematically evaluate them across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content). We assess three key dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability of encoded information, and cross-modal complementarity. We find that most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information, and that this information is complementary. Moreover, models primarily attend to semantically meaningful regions rather than spurious artifacts. Yet none generalize reliably across datasets. This generalization failure likely stems from dataset characteristics, not from the features themselves latching onto superficial patterns.

PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low \"follow rates\" ($\\leq 11\\%$, GPT-5: 4\\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\\%).

However, standard deep learning suffers from a fundamental issue: loss of plasticity, in which networks gradually lose their ability to learn from new data. Here we show that quantum learning models naturally overcome this limitation, preserving plasticity over long timescales. We demonstrate this advantage systematically across a broad spectrum of tasks from multiple learning paradigms, including supervised learning and reinforcement learning, and diverse data modalities, from classical high-dimensional images to quantum-native datasets. Although classical models exhibit performance degradation correlated with unbounded weight and gradient growth, quantum neural networks maintain consistent learning capabilities regardless of the data or task. We identify the origin of the advantage as the intrinsic physical constraints of quantum models. Unlike classical networks where unbounded weight growth leads to landscape ruggedness or saturation, the unitary constraints confine the optimization to a compact manifold.

While much progress has been made in the development of generative models for this task, they have typically been evaluated in simplified scenarios and for single particles. This is particularly true for the challenging task of highly granular calorimeter simulation. For the first time, this work studies the use of highly granular generative calorimeter surrogates in a realistic simulation application. We introduce DDML, a generic library which enables the combination of generative calorimeter surrogates with realistic detectors implemented using the DD4hep toolkit. We compare two different generative models - one operating on a regular grid representation, and the other using a less common point cloud approach. In order to disentangle methodological details from model performance, we provide comparisons to idealized simulators which directly sample representations of different resolutions from the full simulation ground-truth. We then systematically evaluate model performance on post-reconstruction benchmarks for electromagnetic shower simulation. Beginning with a typical single particle study, we introduce a first multi-particle benchmark based on di-photon separations, before studying a first full-physics benchmark based on hadronic decays of the tau lepton. Our results indicate that models operating on a point cloud can achieve a favorable balance between speed and accuracy for highly granular calorimeter simulation compared to those which operate on a regular grid representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86DDML\u5e93\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u91cf\u70ed\u8ba1\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eDD4hep\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\u70ed\u8ba1\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u70b9\u4e91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u548c\u672a\u6765\u5bf9\u649e\u673a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u91cf\u70ed\u8ba1\u7c07\u5c04\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\u70ed\u8ba1\u6a21\u62df\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DDML\u901a\u7528\u5e93\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u91cf\u70ed\u8ba1\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eDD4hep\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u89c4\u5219\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u4e24\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4e0e\u4ece\u5168\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7535\u78c1\u7c07\u5c04\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u540e\u91cd\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u70b9\u4e91\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\u70ed\u8ba1\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u89c4\u5219\u7f51\u683c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff1b\u4ece\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u591a\u7c92\u5b50\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u518d\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u03c4\u8f7b\u5b50\u5f3a\u5b50\u8870\u53d8\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u70b9\u4e91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\u70ed\u8ba1\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5bf9\u649e\u673a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u9700\u6c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we continue on the path proposed by CroCo and focus on learning features tailored for 3D vision. In a nutshell, we extend MAE to arbitrarily many views of the same scene. By uniformly masking all views and employing a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention, our approach is inherently simpler and more scalable than CroCo.

The data includes event time logs recorded in 5 Hz with e.g., driving speed, fuel consumption, vehicle position with centimeter accuracy, and crane use while the vehicle operates in forest areas laser-scanned with very high-resolution, $\\sim$1500 points per square meter. Production log files (StanForD standard) with time-stamped machine events, extensive video material, and terrain data in various formats are included as well. About 18 hours of regular wood extraction work during three days is annotated from 360-video material into individual work elements and included in the dataset. We also include scenario specifications of conducted experiments on forest roads and in terrain. Scenarios include repeatedly driving the same routes with and without steel tracks, different load weight, and different target driving speeds. The dataset is intended for developing models and algorithms for trafficability, perception, and autonomous control of forest machines using artificial intelligence, simulation, and experiments on physical testbeds. In part, we focus on forwarders traversing terrain, avoiding obstacles, and loading or unloading logs, with consideration for efficiency, fuel consumption, safety, and environmental impact.

However, existing PR formulations assume a fixed and known perturbation distribution, an unrealistic expectation in practice. To address this limitation, we propose non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), a more practical PR metric that does not rely on any predefined perturbation distribution. Following the non-parametric paradigm in statistical modeling, NPPR learns an optimized perturbation distribution directly from data, enabling conservative PR evaluation under distributional uncertainty. We further develop an NPPR estimator based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering various input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios. Theoretical analyses establish the relationships among AR, PR, and NPPR. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet across ResNet18/50, WideResNet50 and VGG16 validate NPPR as a more practical robustness metric, showing up to 40\\% more conservative (lower) PR estimates compared to assuming those common perturbation distributions used in state-of-the-arts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6982\u7387\u9c81\u68d2\u6027(NPPR)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u7387\u9c81\u68d2\u6027(PR)\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e14\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b(GMM)\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a(MLP)\u5934\u4ee5\u53ca\u53cc\u4e09\u6b21\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u7684NPPR\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u8f93\u5165\u76f8\u5173\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001CIFAR-100\u548cTiny ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cNPPR\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4fdd\u5b88(\u4f4e40%)\u7684PR\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "NPPR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u6982\u7387\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5916\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u7b56\u7565\u5916\u6570\u636e\u5230\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u76d1\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591aLLM\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u793a\u4f8b\u7a00\u5c11\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u6210\u6216\u7b56\u7565\u5916LLM\u54cd\u5e94\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u516b\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cdLLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u5916\u6570\u636e\u5230\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u76d1\u63a7\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7b56\u7565\u5916\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u6570\u636e\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5904\u7406LLM\u76d1\u63a7\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Yet their ability to generalize across new environments, tasks, and embodiments remains limited. We argue that a major bottleneck lies in their foundations: most RFMs are built by fine-tuning internet-pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, these VLMs are trained on 2D image-language tasks and lack the 3D spatial reasoning inherently required for embodied control in the 3D world. Bridging this gap directly with large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale. Instead, we propose to enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations and enhance a pretrained VLM with 3D understanding capabilities. Following this strategy, we train SPEAR-VLM, a 3D-aware VLM that infers object coordinates in 3D space from a single 2D image. Building on SPEAR-VLM, we introduce our main contribution, $~\\textbf{SPEAR-1}$: a robotic foundation model that integrates grounded 3D perception with language-instructed embodied control.

However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via \"masked-then-fill\" and \"step reordering\" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8.

Augmenting the training data with two different filters before training the neural networks has no performance degradation a priori as compared to a neural network trained with one filter.
