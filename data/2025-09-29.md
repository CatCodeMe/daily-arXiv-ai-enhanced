### [1] [QueryGym: Step-by-Step Interaction with Relational Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21674)
*Haritha Ananthakrishanan,Harsha Kokel,Kelsey Sikes,Debarun Bhattacharjya,Michael Katz,Shirin Sohrabi,Kavitha Srinivas*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: QueryGym是一个交互式环境，用于构建、测试和评估基于LLM的查询规划代理，通过显式的关系代数操作序列确保引擎无关的评估和透明的逐步规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架通常将代理绑定到特定查询语言方言或隐藏其推理过程，缺乏透明度和通用性。

Method: 作为Gymnasium接口实现，提供观察（模式细节、中间结果、执行反馈）并接收动作（数据库探索和关系代数操作）。

Result: 展示了与当代LLM查询数据库的对比，证明了环境的实用性。

Conclusion: QueryGym为查询生成中的错误修复、透明度和强化学习研究提供了实用的测试平台。

Abstract: We introduce QueryGym, an interactive environment for building, testing, and
evaluating LLM-based query planning agents. Existing frameworks often tie
agents to specific query language dialects or obscure their reasoning; QueryGym
instead requires agents to construct explicit sequences of relational algebra
operations, ensuring engine-agnostic evaluation and transparent step-by-step
planning. The environment is implemented as a Gymnasium interface that supplies
observations -- including schema details, intermediate results, and execution
feedback -- and receives actions that represent database exploration (e.g.,
previewing tables, sampling column values, retrieving unique values) as well as
relational algebra operations (e.g., filter, project, join). We detail the
motivation and the design of the environment. In the demo, we showcase the
utility of the environment by contrasting it with contemporary LLMs that query
databases. QueryGym serves as a practical testbed for research in error
remediation, transparency, and reinforcement learning for query generation. For
the associated demo, see https://ibm.biz/QueryGym.

### [2] [Unbiased Binning: Fairness-aware Attribute Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21785)
*Abolfazl Asudeh,Zeinab,Asoodeh,Bita Asoodeh,Omid Asudeh*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了无偏分箱问题，旨在在数据离散化过程中保持组间公平性，通过动态规划算法找到满足组间平衡的最优分箱方案，并进一步提出ε-偏分箱问题来处理分布差异较大的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据离散化是数据共享前的常见步骤，但传统等宽分箱方法会放大数据偏见，导致下游任务不公平。本文旨在解决分箱过程中的公平性问题。

Method: 首先定义边界候选集，证明无偏分箱必须从中选择边界，开发动态规划算法。对于ε-偏分箱，提出DP算法和基于局部搜索的可扩展算法，其中包含分治算法作为关键组件。

Result: 证明了无偏分箱边界必须来自候选集，开发了高效的动态规划算法。对于大规模设置，提出的局部搜索算法能在近线性时间内找到近似最优解。

Conclusion: 本文提供了在数据离散化过程中保持公平性的系统方法，通过理论证明和高效算法解决了无偏分箱和ε-偏分箱问题，为公平数据处理提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Discretizing raw features into bucketized attribute representations is a
popular step before sharing a dataset. It is, however, evident that this step
can cause significant bias in data and amplify unfairness in downstream tasks.
  In this paper, we address this issue by introducing the unbiased binning
problem that, given an attribute to bucketize, finds its closest discretization
to equal-size binning that satisfies group parity across different buckets.
Defining a small set of boundary candidates, we prove that unbiased binning
must select its boundaries from this set. We then develop an efficient dynamic
programming algorithm on top of the boundary candidates to solve the unbiased
binning problem.
  Finding an unbiased binning may sometimes result in a high price of fairness,
or it may not even exist, especially when group values follow different
distributions. Considering that a small bias in the group ratios may be
tolerable in such settings, we introduce the epsilon-biased binning problem
that bounds the group disparities across buckets to a small value epsilon. We
first develop a dynamic programming solution, DP, that finds the optimal
binning in quadratic time. The DP algorithm, while polynomial, does not scale
to very large settings. Therefore, we propose a practically scalable algorithm,
based on local search (LS), for epsilon-biased binning. The key component of
the LS algorithm is a divide-and-conquer (D&C) algorithm that finds a
near-optimal solution for the problem in near-linear time. We prove that D&C
finds a valid solution for the problem unless none exists. The LS algorithm
then initiates a local search, using the D&C solution as the upper bound, to
find the optimal solution.

### [3] [The system of processing and analysis of customer tracking data for customer journey research on the base of RFID technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22162)
*Marina Kholod*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于RFID技术的追踪数据分析系统，用于研究零售业中的客户旅程，通过ETL方法整合RFID和POS数据，构建结构化数据仓库，并结合平衡计分卡评估业务效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用RFID技术超越传统物流应用，扩展到精确库存管理、损失预防和客户体验改善，通过整合追踪和交易数据来深入了解消费者行为。

Method: 采用ETL（提取、转换、加载）方法处理原始RFID和POS数据，构建结构化分析数据仓库，并提出结合财务销售指标与客户移动行为模式的逻辑数据库模型。

Result: 开发了一个综合数据分析系统，能够将财务指标与客户行为模式相结合，为零售业提供前所未有的产品流和消费者行为可见性。

Conclusion: RFID追踪数据与交易数据的整合为零售业向精确、数据驱动的科学转型奠定了基础，实现了对物理产品流和消费者行为的深度洞察。

Abstract: The article focuses on researching a system for processing and analyzing
tracking data based on RFID technology to study the customer journey in retail.
It examines the evolution of RFID technology, its key operating principles, and
modern applications in retail that extend beyond logistics to include precise
inventory management, loss prevention, and customer experience improvement.
Particular attention is paid to the architecture for data collection,
processing, and integration, specifically the ETL (extract, transform, load)
methodology for transforming raw RFID and POS data into a structured analytical
data warehouse. A detailed logical database model is proposed, designed for
comprehensive analysis that combines financial sales metrics with behavioral
patterns of customer movement. The article also analyzes the expected business
benefits of RFID implementation through the lens of the Balanced Scorecard
(BSC), which evaluates financial performance, customer satisfaction, and
internal process optimization. It is concluded that the integration of tracking
and transactional data creates a foundation for transforming retail into a
precise, data-driven science, providing unprecedented visibility into physical
product flows and consumer behavior.

### [4] [I-ETL: an interoperability-aware health (meta) data pipeline to enable federated analyses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22351)
*Nelly Barret,Anna Bernasconi,Boris Bikbov,Pietro Pinoli*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为I-ETL的框架，用于整合医院中高度异构的医疗数据集到可互操作的数据库中，解决联邦学习中数据标准化和互操作性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生需要共享和分析复杂疾病数据，但医疗机构的异构数据格式和缺乏标准化能力阻碍了有效的联邦学习协作。

Method: 设计两个通用可扩展的概念模型来建模数据和元数据，并提出一个确保互操作性的ETL（提取-转换-加载）管道。

Result: 在开源数据集上的实验表明，I-ETL能够成功统一表示各种医疗数据集，并确保不同中心之间的协作可能性。

Conclusion: 将互操作性作为集成管道的首要考虑因素对于实现医疗机构间的有效合作至关重要。

Abstract: Clinicians are interested in better understanding complex diseases, such as
cancer or rare diseases, so they need to produce and exchange data to mutualize
sources and join forces. To do so and ensure privacy, a natural way consists in
using a decentralized architecture and Federated Learning algorithms. This
ensures that data stays in the organization in which it has been collected, but
requires data to be collected in similar settings and similar models. In
practice, this is often not the case because healthcare institutions work
individually with different representations and raw data; they do not have
means to normalize their data, and even less to do so across centers. For
instance, clinicians have at hand phenotypic, clinical, imaging and genomic
data (each individually collected) and want to better understand some diseases
by analyzing them together. This example highlights the needs and challenges
for a cooperative use of this wealth of information. We designed and
implemented a framework, named I-ETL, for integrating highly heterogeneous
healthcare datasets of hospitals in interoperable databases. Our proposal is
twofold: (i) we devise two general and extensible conceptual models for
modeling both data and metadata and (ii) we propose an Extract-Transform-Load
(ETL) pipeline ensuring and assessing interoperability from the start. By
conducting experiments on open-source datasets, we show that I-ETL succeeds in
representing various health datasets in a unified way thanks to our two general
conceptual models. Next, we demonstrate the importance of blending
interoperability as a first-class citizen in integration pipelines, ensuring
possible collaboration between different centers.

### [5] [Redesigning GROMACS Halo Exchange: Improving Strong Scaling with GPU-initiated NVSHMEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21527)
*Mahesh Doijade,Andrey Alekseenko,Ania Brown,Alan Gray,Szilárd Páll*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于NVSHMEM的GPU内核启动的GROMACS域分解光环交换算法重设计，通过GPU内核融合数据打包和通信，利用硬件延迟隐藏实现细粒度重叠，显著提高了分子动力学模拟的强扩展性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GROMACS分子动力学模拟在异构超级计算机上的可扩展性面临挑战，因为MPI的CPU中心特性在GPU驻留应用的关键路径上引入了额外延迟，阻碍了GPU利用率和可扩展性。

Method: 采用NVSHMEM-based GPU内核启动的域分解光环交换算法重设计，通过高度调优的GPU内核融合数据打包和通信，利用硬件延迟隐藏实现细粒度重叠，并跨重叠数据转发通信阶段进行内核融合，使用异步复制引擎通过NVLink优化延迟和带宽。

Result: GPU驻留方案大幅增加了通信-计算重叠，将GROMACS强扩展性能在NVLink上提高了1.5倍（节点内）和2倍（多节点），在NVLink+InfiniBand上多节点性能提高了1.3倍。

Conclusion: GPU启动通信对于强扩展广泛的延迟敏感应用具有深远益处。

Abstract: Improving time-to-solution in molecular dynamics simulations often requires
strong scaling due to fixed-sized problems. GROMACS is highly
latency-sensitive, with peak iteration rates in the sub-millisecond, making
scalability on heterogeneous supercomputers challenging. MPI's CPU-centric
nature introduces additional latencies on GPU-resident applications' critical
path, hindering GPU utilization and scalability. To address these limitations,
we present an NVSHMEM-based GPU kernel-initiated redesign of the GROMACS domain
decomposition halo-exchange algorithm. Highly tuned GPU kernels fuse data
packing and communication, leveraging hardware latency-hiding for fine-grained
overlap. We employ kernel fusion across overlapped data forwarding
communication phases and utilize the asynchronous copy engine over NVLink to
optimize latency and bandwidth. Our GPU-resident formulation greatly increases
communication-computation overlap, improving GROMACS strong scaling performance
across NVLink by up to 1.5x (intra-node) and 2x (multi-node), and up to 1.3x
multi-node over NVLink+InfiniBand. This demonstrates the profound benefits of
GPU-initiated communication for strong-scaling a broad range of
latency-sensitive applications.

### [6] [Zeppelin: Balancing Variable-length Workloads in Data Parallel Large Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21841)
*Chang Chen,Tiancheng Chen,Jiangfei Duan,Qianchao Zhu,Zerui Wang,Qinghao Hu,Peng Sun,Xiuhong Li,Chao Yang,Torsten Hoefler*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Zeppelin是一个解决大语言模型训练中序列长度变化导致的负载不平衡问题的系统，通过分层序列分区、路由层和重映射层等技术，实现了比现有方法平均2.80倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大语言模型时，序列长度的变化会导致严重的负载不平衡问题，现有方法忽略了计算和通信成本随序列长度的变化，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出Zeppelin系统，包含三个关键技术：1）注意力模块的分层序列分区方法，减少通信开销并平衡计算；2）路由层协调节点间传输以充分利用NIC带宽；3）重映射层在注意力和线性模块间转换序列布局。

Result: 在各种配置下的综合评估显示，Zeppelin相比最先进方法实现了平均2.80倍的加速。

Conclusion: Zeppelin通过解决序列长度变化带来的计算和通信挑战，显著提升了大语言模型训练的效率。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with increasingly long and varying
sequence lengths introduces severe load imbalance challenges in large-scale
data-parallel training. Recent frameworks attempt to mitigate these issues
through data reorganization or hybrid parallel strategies. However, they often
overlook how computational and communication costs scale with sequence length,
resulting in suboptimal performance. We identify three critical challenges: (1)
varying computation-to-communication ratios across sequences of different
lengths in distributed attention, (2) mismatch between static NIC-GPU affinity
and dynamic parallel workloads, and (3) distinct optimal partitioning
strategies required for quadratic attention versus linear components. To
address these challenges, we present Zeppelin, a novel training system that
integrates three key techniques: (1) a hierarchical sequence partitioning
method for the attention module that reduces communication overhead and
balances computation, supported by an efficient attention engine that applies
divergent parallel strategies; (2) a routing layer that orchestrates inter-node
transfers to fully utilize NIC bandwidth; and (3) a remapping layer that
transforms sequence layouts between attention and linear modules, ensuring high
computational efficiency across both. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse
configurations show that Zeppelin delivers an average 2.80x speedup over
state-of-the-art methods.

### [7] [Code once, Run Green: Automated Green Code Translation in Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22068)
*Sebastian Werner,Mathis Kähler,Alireza Hakamian*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出ReFaaS系统，利用LLM将无服务器函数转换为更节能的编程语言，可减少高达70%的调用能耗，在3000-5000次调用后实现净节能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算基础设施的碳排放问题日益严重，现有节能策略依赖利益相关者干预，难以在遗留系统中实施，导致能源债务持续累积。

Method: 设计并实现ReFaaS系统，集成到Fission无服务器框架中，利用LLM进行代码翻译，将函数转换为更节能的编程语言。

Result: 翻译后的函数调用能耗降低高达70%，在3000-5000次调用后实现净节能，但并非所有函数都适合翻译。

Conclusion: 该方法面临挑战，但提出了四个关键研究挑战，解决后可实现无服务器计算中长期自动化的能源债务缓解。

Abstract: The rapid digitization and the increasing use of emerging technologies such
as AI models have significantly contributed to the emissions of computing
infrastructure. Efforts to mitigate this impact typically focus on the
infrastructure level such as powering data centers with renewable energy, or
through the specific design of energy-efficient software. However, both
strategies rely on stakeholder intervention, making their adoption in legacy
and already-deployed systems unlikely. As a result, past architectural and
implementation decisions continue to incur additional energy usage - a
phenomenon we refer to as energy debt.
  Hence, in this paper, we investigate the potential of serverless computing
platforms to automatically reduce energy debt by leveraging the unique access
to function source code. Specifically, we explore whether large language models
(LLMs) can translate serverless functions into more energy-efficient
programming languages while preserving functional correctness. To this end, we
design and implement ReFaaS and integrate it into the Fission serverless
framework. We evaluate multiple LLMs on their ability to perform such code
translations and analyze their impact on energy consumption.
  Our preliminary results indicate that translated functions can reduce
invocation energy by up to 70%, achieving net energy savings after
approximately 3,000 to 5,000 invocations, depending on the LLM used.
Nonetheless, the approach faces several challenges: not all functions are
suitable for translation, and for some, the amortization threshold is
significantly higher or unreachable. Despite these limitations, we identify
four key research challenges whose resolution could unlock long-term, automated
mitigation of energy debt in serverless computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在科学研究中的广泛应用对计算基础设施提出了新挑战，特别是在硬件加速器的配置和管理方面。AI_INFN项目旨在促进INFN内部机器学习技术的采用，通过提供AI定制计算资源来支持多样化的研究活动。

Method: 利用Kubernetes平台和云原生解决方案，结合Virtual Kubelet和InterLink API的卸载机制，管理跨不同资源提供者（包括LHC计算网格和超级计算机）的工作流。

Conclusion: 该Kubernetes平台为GPU驱动的数据分析工作流提供了有效的开发和扩展解决方案，支持跨异构计算资源的无缝管理。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is driving a revolution in the way scientists design,
develop, and deploy data-intensive software. However, the adoption of ML
presents new challenges for the computing infrastructure, particularly in terms
of provisioning and orchestrating access to hardware accelerators for
development, testing, and production. The INFN-funded project AI_INFN
(Artificial Intelligence at INFN) aims at fostering the adoption of ML
techniques within INFN use cases by providing support on multiple aspects,
including the provisioning of AI-tailored computing resources. It leverages
cloud-native solutions in the context of INFN Cloud, to share hardware
accelerators as effectively as possible, ensuring the diversity of the
Institute's research activities is not compromised. In this contribution, we
provide an update on the commissioning of a Kubernetes platform designed to
ease the development of GPU-powered data analysis workflows and their
scalability on heterogeneous distributed computing resources, also using the
offloading mechanism with Virtual Kubelet and InterLink API. This setup can
manage workflows across different resource providers, including sites of the
Worldwide LHC Computing Grid and supercomputers such as CINECA Leonardo,
providing a model for use cases requiring dedicated infrastructures for
different parts of the workload. Initial test results, emerging case studies,
and integration scenarios will be presented with functional tests and
benchmarks.

### [9] [Orientation does not help with 3-coloring a grid in online-LOCAL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22233)
*Thomas Boudier,Filippo Casagrande,Avinandan Das,Massimo Equi,Henrik Lievonen,Augusto Modanese,Ronja Stimpert*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文证明了在确定性或随机化online-LOCAL模型中，即使算法明确获得网格的全局一致方向，3-着色仍然需要Ω(log n)的局部性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究表明3-着色在online-LOCAL模型中需要高局部性，但这些证明都依赖于算法无法访问网格方向的假设。本文旨在消除这一限制。

Method: 通过新的技术方法，展示了即使在算法明确获得网格全局方向的情况下，3-着色的局部性下界仍然成立。

Result: 成功证明了在确定性或随机化online-LOCAL模型中，3-着色需要Ω(log n)的局部性，即使算法拥有网格的全局方向信息。

Conclusion: 网格3-着色问题在online-LOCAL模型中的高局部性要求是固有的，不依赖于算法是否知道网格方向这一假设。

Abstract: The online-LOCAL and SLOCAL models are extensions of the LOCAL model where
nodes are processed in a sequential but potentially adversarial order. So far,
the only problem we know of where the global memory of the online-LOCAL model
has an advantage over SLOCAL is 3-coloring bipartite graphs. Recently, Chang et
al. [PODC 2024] showed that even in grids, 3-coloring requires $\Omega(\log n)$
locality in deterministic online-LOCAL. This result was subsequently extended
by Akbari et al. [STOC 2025] to also hold in randomized online-LOCAL. However,
both proofs heavily rely on the assumption that the algorithm does not have
access to the orientation of the underlying grid. In this paper, we show how to
lift this requirement and obtain the same lower bound (against either model)
even when the algorithm is explicitly given a globally consistent orientation
of the grid.

### [10] [New Algorithmic Directions in Optimal Transport and Applications for Product Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21502)
*Salman Beigi,Omid Etesami,Mohammad Mahmoody,Amir Najafi*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高维分布间最优传输的高效算法，可在多项式时间内将任意乘积分布传输到任意目标分布，并实现了算法版本的Talagrand不等式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高维分布间最优传输的计算效率问题，旨在开发运行时间仅依赖于维度而非分布表示大小的算法，解决传统最优传输方法在高维场景下的计算瓶颈。

Method: 提出通用算法处理任意乘积分布到任意目标分布的传输，引入"顺序可采样"的新概念，并构建基于成员资格查询的顺序采样器。

Result: 实现了从标准高斯分布到任意分布的算法传输，对于测度为ε的集合，在poly(n/ε)时间内获得期望平方距离O(log 1/ε)的传输结果，达到一般集合的最优界。

Conclusion: 该工作首次实现了高斯测度下欧氏距离的维度无关传输成本的计算集中性结果，解决了Etesami等人提出的开放问题。

Abstract: We study optimal transport between two high-dimensional distributions
$\mu,\nu$ in $R^n$ from an algorithmic perspective: given $x \sim \mu$, find a
close $y \sim \nu$ in $poly(n)$ time, where $n$ is the dimension of $x,y$.
Thus, running time depends on the dimension rather than the full representation
size of $\mu,\nu$. Our main result is a general algorithm for transporting any
product distribution $\mu$ to any $\nu$ with cost $\Delta + \delta$ under
$\ell_p^p$, where $\Delta$ is the Knothe-Rosenblatt transport cost and $\delta$
is a computational error decreasing with runtime. This requires $\nu$ to be
"sequentially samplable" with bounded average sampling cost, a new but natural
notion.
  We further prove:
  An algorithmic version of Talagrand's inequality for transporting the
standard Gaussian $\Phi^n$ to arbitrary $\nu$ under squared Euclidean cost. For
$\nu = \Phi^n$ conditioned on a set $\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\varepsilon$, we
construct the sequential sampler in expected time $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ using
membership oracle access to $\mathcal{S}$. This yields an algorithmic transport
from $\Phi^n$ to $\Phi^n|\mathcal{S}$ in $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ time and
expected squared distance $O(\log 1/\varepsilon)$, optimal for general
$\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\varepsilon$.
  As corollary, we obtain the first computational concentration result (Etesami
et al. SODA 2020) for Gaussian measure under Euclidean distance with
dimension-independent transportation cost, resolving an open question of
Etesami et al. Specifically, for any $\mathcal{S}$ of Gaussian measure
$\varepsilon$, most $\Phi^n$ samples can be mapped to $\mathcal{S}$ within
distance $O(\sqrt{\log 1/\varepsilon})$ in $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ time.

*Slobodan Mitrović,Theodore Pan,Mahdi Qaempanah,Mohammad Amin Raeisi*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了在有向图中寻找近似最密子图的新算法，改进了MPC模型和半流模型中的现有结果，包括首个确定性单遍半流算法和首个具有次线性内存的最坏情况更新时间的动态算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找最密子图是社区检测、聚类和数据挖掘中的基本问题。现有方法在MPC和半流模型中的性能有限，需要改进近似比和计算效率。

Method: 开发了在MPC模型中实现(2+ε)-近似的算法，需要Õ(√log n)轮次和次线性内存；同时提出了单遍半流算法实现O(log n)-近似，这也是首个确定性单遍算法。

Result: MPC算法将轮次从Õ(log n)改进到Õ(√log n)；半流算法实现了首个确定性单遍O(log n)-近似，相比之前的Õ(n^{1/6})-近似有显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在理论和实验上都优于现有方法，半流算法在实际数据集上表现接近(2+ε)-近似，MPC算法需要更少的计算轮次。

Abstract: Finding dense subgraphs is a fundamental problem with applications to
community detection, clustering, and data mining. Our work focuses on finding
approximate densest subgraphs in directed graphs in computational models for
processing massive data. We consider two such models: Massively Parallel
Computation (MPC) and semi-streaming. We show how to find a
$(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log n})$ MPC rounds with
sublinear memory per machine. This improves the state-of-the-art results by
Bahmani et al. (WAW 2014) and Mitrovi\'c & Pan (ICML 2024). Moreover, we show
how to find an $O(\log n)$-approximation in a single pass in semi-streaming.
This is in stark contrast to prior work, which implies
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/6})$-approximation for a single pass; a better
approximation is known only for randomized streams (Mitrovi\'c & Pan). This is
the first deterministic single-pass semi-streaming algorithm for the densest
subgraph problem, both for undirected and directed graphs. Our semi-streaming
approach is also an insertion-only dynamic algorithm, attaining the first
directed densest subgraph algorithm with $O(\log^2 n)$ worst-case update time
while using sub-linear memory. We empirically evaluate our approaches in two
ways. First, we illustrate that our single-pass semi-streaming algorithm
performs much better than the theoretical guarantee. Specifically, its
approximation on temporal datasets matches the $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation
of an $O(\log n)$-pass algorithm by Bahmani et al. (VLDB 2012). Second, we
demonstrate that our MPC algorithm requires fewer rounds than prior work.

*Amir Carmel,Robert Krauthgamer*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了稳定核心集的概念，介于弱核心集和强核心集之间，通过均匀采样实现了高效构建，适用于ℓ₁度量下的1-中位数聚类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 均匀采样是数据摘要的高效方法，但在聚类问题中产生核心集的有效性尚未被充分理解，因为它通常无法产生强核心集。

Method: 提出稳定核心集的概念，通过均匀采样构建，样本大小为O(ε⁻²log d)，适用于ℓ₁度量下的1-中位数问题。

Result: 实验验证了稳定核心集在构建时间和近似质量方面的优势，并扩展到ℓ₁相关度量、公平聚类和k-中位数近似算法。

Conclusion: 稳定核心集有效结合了强核心集的广泛适用性和弱核心集的高效构建，为聚类问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Uniform sampling is a highly efficient method for data summarization.
However, its effectiveness in producing coresets for clustering problems is not
yet well understood, primarily because it generally does not yield a strong
coreset, which is the prevailing notion in the literature. We formulate
\emph{stable coresets}, a notion that is intermediate between the standard
notions of weak and strong coresets, and effectively combines the broad
applicability of strong coresets with highly efficient constructions, through
uniform sampling, of weak coresets. Our main result is that a uniform sample of
size $O(\epsilon^{-2}\log d)$ yields, with high constant probability, a stable
coreset for $1$-median in $\mathbb{R}^d$ under the $\ell_1$ metric. We then
leverage the powerful properties of stable coresets to easily derive new
coreset constructions, all through uniform sampling, for $\ell_1$ and related
metrics, such as Kendall-tau and Jaccard. We also show applications to fair
clustering and to approximation algorithms for $k$-median problems in these
metric spaces. Our experiments validate the benefits of stable coresets in
practice, in terms of both construction time and approximation quality.

*Hans Vandierendonck*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一系列优化最大团搜索的技术，包括高效图表示、搜索前过滤、早期退出交集算法和算法选择利用，实现了相比PMC算法38.9倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最大团问题是NP难问题，执行时间较长。虽然与最大团枚举类似，但只需要找到最大尺寸的团，关键在于高效证明搜索空间的某些部分不包含最大团，从而跳过主要搜索区域。

Method: 提出了四种优化技术：(i) 高效延迟构建的图表示；(ii) 详细搜索前的过滤；(iii) 高效的早期退出交集算法；(iv) 算法选择的利用。

Result: 相比最相似的PMC算法实现了最高38.9倍的加速，相比MC-BRB算法实现了最高11倍的加速。

Conclusion: 通过跳过搜索空间主要部分的技术，显著提升了最大团搜索的效率，证明了所提优化方法的有效性。

Abstract: The maximum clique (MC) problem is a challenging graph mining problem which,
due to its NP-hard nature, can take a substantial amount of execution time. The
MC problem is dominated by set intersection operations similar to Maximal
Clique Enumeration, however it differs in requiring to find only a clique of
maximum size. As such, key to the problem is to demonstrate efficiently that a
particular part of the search space does not contain a maximum clique, allowing
to skip over major parts of the search space. We present a number of techniques
to optimize MC search in light of leaving major parts of the search space
unvisited, including (i) an efficient, lazily constructed graph representation;
(ii) filtering prior to initiating a detailed search; (iii) efficient
early-exit intersection algorithms; (iv) exploiting algorithmic choice. These
techniques result in a speedup of up to 38.9x compared to PMC, which is the
most comparable algorithm, and a speedup up to 11x over MC-BRB.

*Max Hugen,Bob Krekelberg,Alison Hsiang-Hsuan Liu*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 在线消防员问题在树上具有2-竞争性，但在含环图中变得困难。本文证明在蝌蚪图上确定性在线算法的竞争比至少为Ω(√n)，并为1-几乎树和仙人掌图设计了O(√n)-竞争算法。当消防员成对释放时，问题变为3-竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展在线消防员问题到含环图的研究，因为已知在树上该问题相对简单(2-竞争)，但环的存在给对手带来优势，需要研究更复杂图结构上的算法性能。

Method: 设计了针对1-几乎树和仙人掌图的O(√n)-竞争算法，使用充电框架将最优解拯救的顶点分配到算法拯救的顶点上，确保每个算法顶点最多被充电常数次。还研究了消防员成对释放的特殊情况。

Result: 在蝌蚪图上证明了下界Ω(√n)，为1-几乎树和仙人掌图设计了O(√n)-竞争算法。当消防员成对释放时，竞争比降至3。

Conclusion: 环的存在显著增加了在线消防员问题的难度，但在受限图类(仙人掌图)和特殊设置(成对释放消防员)下仍可设计有效算法。充电框架是处理算法与最优解在不同残图操作的关键技术。

Abstract: It is known that the online firefighting is 2-competitive on trees
(Coupechoux et al. 2016), which suggests that the problem is relatively easy on
trees. We extend the study to graphs containing cycles. We first show that the
presence of cycles gives a strong advantage to the adversary: cycles create
situations where the algorithm and the optimal solution operate on different
game states, and the adversary can exploit the uncertainty in the firefighter
sequence to trap the algorithm. Specifically, we prove that even on a tadpole
graph (a cycle with a tail path), no deterministic online algorithm achieves a
competitive ratio better than $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$, where n is the number of
vertices. We then propose an $O(\sqrt{n})$-competitive algorithm for 1-almost
trees, which contain at most one cycle and generalize tadpole graphs. We
further generalize this algorithm to cactus graphs, in which multiple cycles
may appear, but no two share more than one vertex, and show that the online
firefighting problem on cactus graphs remains $O(\sqrt{n})$-competitive.
Finally, since cactus graphs have treewidth at most 2, we study a variant where
firefighters are released in pairs, that is, each round an even number of
firefighters is available. Surprisingly, in this setting the competitive
complexity is significantly reduced, and we prove that the problem is at most
3-competitive.
  The main technical challenges lie in both algorithm design and analysis,
since the algorithm and the optimal solution may break different cycles and
thus operate on different residual graphs. To overcome this difficulty, we
design a charging framework that carefully partitions the vertices saved by the
optimal solution and charges them to the vertices saved by the algorithm.
Namely, the charging scheme is carefully constructed to ensure that each vertex
saved by the algorithm is charged at most a constant number of times.

### [15] [Fine-Grained Classification Of Detecting Dominating Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22332)
*Jonathan Dransfeld,Marvin Künnemann,Mirza Redzic*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文研究了支配P模式的细粒度复杂度分类问题，定义了一个图参数ρ(P)，在ω=2的假设下，给出了除三角形外的所有模式P的最优运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献研究了特定模式（如团、匹配、独立集等）的支配模式检测，但缺乏对所有模式P的完整细粒度复杂度分类。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 定义了一个新的图参数ρ(P)，该参数与Alon(1981)研究的δ(P)参数密切相关但有时不同。基于正交向量假设，推导出检测支配P模式的最优运行时间。

Result: 在ω=2的假设下，对于除三角形外的所有模式P，检测支配P模式的最优运行时间为(n^ρ(P) m^(|V(P)|-ρ(P)/2))^(1±o(1))，其中G有n个顶点和m=Θ(n^α)条边。

Conclusion: 本文成功实现了对所有模式P（除三角形外）的支配模式检测的细粒度复杂度分类，这与检测任意诱导P模式缺乏完整分类形成对比。

Abstract: We consider the following generalization of dominating sets: Let $G$ be a
host graph and $P$ be a pattern graph $P$. A dominating $P$-pattern in $G$ is a
subset $S$ of vertices in $G$ that (1) forms a dominating set in $G$ \emph{and}
(2) induces a subgraph isomorphic to $P$. The graph theory literature studies
the properties of dominating $P$-patterns for various patterns $P$, including
cliques, matchings, independent sets, cycles and paths. Previous work
(Kunnemann, Redzic 2024) obtains algorithms and conditional lower bounds for
detecting dominating $P$-patterns particularly for $P$ being a $k$-clique, a
$k$-independent set and a $k$-matching. Their results give conditionally tight
lower bounds if $k$ is sufficiently large (where the bound depends the matrix
multiplication exponent $\omega$). We ask: Can we obtain a classification of
the fine-grained complexity for \emph{all} patterns $P$?
  Indeed, we define a graph parameter $\rho(P)$ such that if $\omega=2$, then
\[ \left(n^{\rho(P)} m^{\frac{|V(P)|-\rho(P)}{2}}\right)^{1\pm o(1)} \] is the
optimal running time assuming the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis, for all
patterns $P$ except the triangle $K_3$. Here, the host graph $G$ has $n$
vertices and $m=\Theta(n^\alpha)$ edges, where $1\le \alpha \le 2$.
  The parameter $\rho(P)$ is closely related (but sometimes different) to a
parameter $\delta(P) = \max_{S\subseteq V(P)} |S|-|N(S)|$ studied in (Alon
1981) to tightly quantify the maximum number of occurrences of induced
subgraphs isomorphic to $P$. Our results stand in contrast to the lack of a
full fine-grained classification of detecting an arbitrary (not necessarily
\emph{dominating}) induced $P$-pattern.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RepoLens通过提取和利用代码仓库的概念知识，将细粒度功能分解并重组为高层次关注点，有效解决了大型仓库中关注点混合和分散的问题，显著提升了问题定位的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的问题定位方法在大型代码仓库中面临关注点混合（相关逻辑被埋没在大型函数中）和关注点分散（相关逻辑分散在多个文件中）的挑战，导致定位准确性下降。

Method: RepoLens采用两阶段方法：离线阶段提取和丰富概念知识构建仓库级知识库；在线阶段检索问题特定术语，对关注点进行聚类和排序，并通过最小侵入式提示增强将其集成到定位工作流中。

Result: 在SWE-Lancer-Loc基准测试的216个任务中，RepoLens显著提升了三种最先进工具的性能，在文件和函数级定位中平均提升超过22%的Hit@k和46%的Recall@k，在不同模型上Hit@1和Recall@10分别提升高达504%和376%。

Conclusion: RepoLens通过概念知识抽象有效解决了大型代码仓库中的问题定位挑战，消融研究和人工评估证实了构建的关注点的有效性和可靠性。

Abstract: Issue localization, which identifies faulty code elements such as files or
functions, is critical for effective bug fixing. While recent LLM-based and
LLM-agent-based approaches improve accuracy, they struggle in large-scale
repositories due to concern mixing, where relevant logic is buried in large
functions, and concern scattering, where related logic is dispersed across
files.
  To address these challenges, we propose RepoLens, a novel approach that
abstracts and leverages conceptual knowledge from code repositories. RepoLens
decomposes fine-grained functionalities and recomposes them into high-level
concerns, semantically coherent clusters of functionalities that guide LLMs. It
operates in two stages: an offline stage that extracts and enriches conceptual
knowledge into a repository-wide knowledge base, and an online stage that
retrieves issue-specific terms, clusters and ranks concerns by relevance, and
integrates them into localization workflows via minimally intrusive prompt
enhancements. We evaluate RepoLens on SWE-Lancer-Loc, a benchmark of 216 tasks
derived from SWE-Lancer. RepoLens consistently improves three state-of-the-art
tools, namely AgentLess, OpenHands, and mini-SWE-agent, achieving average gains
of over 22% in Hit@k and 46% in Recall@k for file- and function-level
localization. It generalizes across models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1) with
Hit@1 and Recall@10 gains up to 504% and 376%, respectively. Ablation studies
and manual evaluation confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the
constructed concerns.

TL;DR: 研究女性软件工程师在职业中断后重返学术界面临的挑战，比较学术界与产业界的支持差异，并提出促进透明招聘实践的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术界为女性重返职场提供的支持机会有限，而IT产业已有多种支持路径。职业中断（如怀孕、移民身份、缺乏灵活工作选择）严重影响女性职业发展，造成重返学术界的障碍。

Method: 开展多元文化研究项目，在多个国家和大学进行调查，比较不同地区的政策和机会差异，分析机构视角和现有政策。

Result: 研究发现学术界在促进女性重返职场方面的政策和措施不如产业界显著和受认可，存在明显的支持差距。

Conclusion: 需要为女性重返学术界提供更好的支持机制，包括透明招聘实践和更包容的政策环境，以缩小与产业界的差距。

Abstract: The IT industry provides supportive pathways such as returnship programs,
coding boot camps, and buddy systems for women re-entering their job after a
career break. Academia, however, offers limited opportunities to motivate women
to return. We propose a diverse multicultural research project investigating
the challenges faced by women with software engineering (SE) backgrounds
re-entering academia or related research roles after a career break. Career
disruptions due to pregnancy, immigration status, or lack of flexible work
options can significantly impact women's career progress, creating barriers for
returning as lecturers, professors, or senior researchers. Although many
companies promote gender diversity policies, such measures are less prominent
and often under-recognized within academic institutions. Our goal is to explore
the specific challenges women encounter when re-entering academic roles
compared to industry roles; to understand the institutional perspective,
including a comparative analysis of existing policies and opportunities in
different countries for women to return to the field; and finally, to provide
recommendations that support transparent hiring practices. The research project
will be carried out in multiple universities and in multiple countries to
capture the diverse challenges and policies that vary by location.

Motivation: Excel功能复杂但教程依赖专家手动编写，更新成本高且无法满足持续需求，现有方法未能实现完全自动化教程生成。

Method: 框架包含任务实例化、执行代理在Excel中规划执行解决方案、收集中间产物，最后转化为结构化文档和视频演示。

Result: 在1559个真实场景任务上测试，任务执行成功率比现有最佳方法提高8.5%，生成教程可读性和教学效果接近或超越专家编写材料，时间成本降至专家编写的1/20。

Conclusion: 该自动化框架首次实现了可扩展的高质量Excel教程生成，消除了人工劳动，具有重要的实用价值。

Abstract: Excel is one of the most widely used productivity tools across domains,
offering rich functionality but also overwhelming users with its complexity.
This creates a persistent demand for tutorials to support effective usage.
However, existing tutorials are manually authored by experts, require frequent
updates after each software release, and incur substantial labor costs. Prior
work has not achieved fully automated tutorial generation, since existing
methods still depend on handcrafted operation sequences or example materials.
In this paper, we present the first framework for automatically generating
Excel tutorials directly from natural language task descriptions. Our framework
first instantiates the task. Then a central component of this framework,
Execution Agent, plans and executes the solution in Excel, and collects the
intermediate artifacts required for tutorial construction. These artifacts are
then transformed into both structured Excel documents and video demonstrations.
To build a comprehensive tutorial corpus, we collected 1,559 task descriptions
from real-world scenarios. In addition, we designed a systematic evaluation
framework that integrates assessments from both large language models (LLMs)
and human reviewers. Experimental results show that our framework improves task
execution success rates by 8.5% over state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the
generated tutorials demonstrate superior readability and instructional
effectiveness, often approaching or surpassing expert-authored materials.
Importantly, the automated pipeline eliminates manual labor and reduces time
costs to 1/20 of expert authoring, making scalable and high-quality tutorial
generation practical for the first time.

TL;DR: AgentPack是一个包含130万代码编辑的数据集，由Claude Code、OpenAI Codex和Cursor Agent与人类共同编写，用于训练更好的代码编辑模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于提交记录的训练数据存在噪音：提交信息简短、包含多个无关编辑、许多提交来自简单的基于规则的机器人。而AI代理与人类共同编写的代码编辑更专注、目标更清晰。

Method: 从公共GitHub项目中收集和筛选由AI代理共同编写的代码编辑，建立识别和筛选流程，分析这些编辑的结构特性。

Result: 在AgentPack上微调的模型性能优于基于传统人类提交数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 利用软件工程AI代理产生的公共数据训练未来的代码编辑模型具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models for code editing has typically relied on
mining commits and pull requests. The working hypothesis has been that commit
messages describe human intent in natural language, and patches to code
describe the changes that implement that intent. However, much of the
previously collected data is noisy: commit messages are terse, human-written
commits commingle several unrelated edits, and many commits come from simple,
rule-based bots.
  The recent adoption of software engineering agents changes this landscape.
Code changes co-authored by humans and agents tend to be more narrowly scoped
and focused on clearer goals. Their commit messages, generated by LLMs,
articulate intent and rationale in much greater detail. Moreover, when these
changes land in public repositories, they are implicitly filtered by humans:
maintainers discard low-quality commits to their projects.
  We present AgentPack, a corpus of 1.3M code edits co-authored by Claude Code,
OpenAI Codex, and Cursor Agent across public GitHub projects up to mid-August
2025. We describe the identification and curation pipeline, quantify adoption
trends of these agents, and analyze the structural properties of the edits.
Finally, we show that models fine-tuned on AgentPack can outperform models
trained on prior human-only commit corpora, highlighting the potential of using
public data from software engineering agents to train future code-editing
models.

Motivation: 传统观点认为配置调优需要更准确的代理模型，但先前研究发现准确性可能具有欺骗性，这引发了对代理模型在配置调优中真正作用的疑问。

Method: 通过适应度景观分析视角，提出评估模型有用性的替代理论，并进行涉及27,000个案例的实证研究，开发Model4Tune预测工具。

Result: Model4Tune在79%-82%的情况下显著优于随机猜测，能够为未见系统预测最佳模型-调优器组合。

Conclusion: 研究不仅揭示了未来研究方向，还提供了实用解决方案，帮助从业者评估配置调优中最有用的模型。

Abstract: To efficiently tune configuration for better system performance (e.g.,
latency), many tuners have leveraged a surrogate model to expedite the process
instead of solely relying on the profoundly expensive system measurement. As
such, it is naturally believed that we need more accurate models. However, the
fact of accuracy can lie-a somewhat surprising finding from prior work-has left
us many unanswered questions regarding what role the surrogate model plays in
configuration tuning. This paper provides the very first systematic exploration
and discussion, together with a resolution proposal, to disclose the many faces
of surrogate models for configuration tuning, through the novel perspective of
fitness landscape analysis. We present a theory as an alternative to accuracy
for assessing the model usefulness in tuning, based on which we conduct an
extensive empirical study involving up to 27,000 cases. Drawing on the above,
we propose Model4Tune, an automated predictive tool that estimates which
model-tuner pairs are the best for an unforeseen system without expensive tuner
profiling. Our results suggest that Moldel4Tune, as one of the first of its
kind, performs significantly better than random guessing in 79%-82% of the
cases. Our results not only shed light on the possible future research
directions but also offer a practical resolution that can assist practitioners
in evaluating the most useful model for configuration tuning.

TL;DR: SecureAgentBench是一个包含105个编码任务的基准测试，用于严格评估代码代理在安全代码生成方面的能力，发现当前代理在生成安全代码方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往忽略漏洞引入的真实上下文，或采用狭窄的评估协议，无法同时捕捉功能正确性和新引入的漏洞，因此需要更全面的安全代码生成评估基准。

Method: 设计了包含真实任务设置、基于真实开源漏洞的对齐上下文，以及结合功能测试、漏洞检查和静态分析的综合评估方法。评估了三种代表性代理和三种最先进的LLM。

Result: 当前代理难以生成安全代码，表现最佳的SWE-agent仅达到15.2%的正确且安全解决方案；一些代理生成功能正确代码但仍引入漏洞；明确的安全指令对改善安全编码效果不显著。

Conclusion: SecureAgentBench为安全代码生成建立了严格的基准，是迈向更可靠LLM软件开发的重要一步，表明需要进一步研究来提升代码代理的安全性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) powered code agents are rapidly transforming
software engineering by automating tasks such as testing, debugging, and
repairing, yet the security risks of their generated code have become a
critical concern. Existing benchmarks have offered valuable insights but remain
insufficient: they often overlook the genuine context in which vulnerabilities
were introduced or adopt narrow evaluation protocols that fail to capture
either functional correctness or newly introduced vulnerabilities. We therefore
introduce SecureAgentBench, a benchmark of 105 coding tasks designed to
rigorously evaluate code agents' capabilities in secure code generation. Each
task includes (i) realistic task settings that require multi-file edits in
large repositories, (ii) aligned contexts based on real-world open-source
vulnerabilities with precisely identified introduction points, and (iii)
comprehensive evaluation that combines functionality testing, vulnerability
checking through proof-of-concept exploits, and detection of newly introduced
vulnerabilities using static analysis. We evaluate three representative agents
(SWE-agent, OpenHands, and Aider) with three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7
Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1). Results show that (i) current agents
struggle to produce secure code, as even the best-performing one, SWE-agent
supported by DeepSeek-V3.1, achieves merely 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions,
(ii) some agents produce functionally correct code but still introduce
vulnerabilities, including new ones not previously recorded, and (iii) adding
explicit security instructions for agents does not significantly improve secure
coding, underscoring the need for further research. These findings establish
SecureAgentBench as a rigorous benchmark for secure code generation and a step
toward more reliable software development with LLMs.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SK2Decompile提出了一种两阶段反编译方法，先将二进制代码转换为中间表示（骨架），再生成有意义的标识符（皮肤），显著提升了反编译的正确性和可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的反编译器在有效呈现程序源代码结构及其原始标识符方面存在局限性，需要改进反编译质量。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）结构恢复模型将二进制代码转换为中间表示，保留控制流和数据结构，用通用占位符混淆标识符；2）标识符命名模型生成反映程序语义的有意义标识符。两个阶段都使用强化学习来优化模型输出。

Result: 在HumanEval数据集上比GPT-5-mini平均重执行率提升21.6%，在GitHub2025基准上比Idioms平均R2I改进29.4%。

Conclusion: SK2Decompile通过分离骨架和皮肤的反编译过程，独立提升反编译的正确性和可读性，显著优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising approach for binary
decompilation. However, the existing LLM-based decompilers still are somewhat
limited in effectively presenting a program's source-level structure with its
original identifiers. To mitigate this, we introduce SK2Decompile, a novel
two-phase approach to decompile from the skeleton (semantic structure) to the
skin (identifier) of programs. Specifically, we first apply a Structure
Recovery model to translate a program's binary code to an Intermediate
Representation (IR) as deriving the program's "skeleton", i.e., preserving
control flow and data structures while obfuscating all identifiers with generic
placeholders. We also apply reinforcement learning to reward the model for
producing program structures that adhere to the syntactic and semantic rules
expected by compilers. Second, we apply an Identifier Naming model to produce
meaningful identifiers which reflect actual program semantics as deriving the
program's "skin". We train the Identifier Naming model with a separate
reinforcement learning objective that rewards the semantic similarity between
its predictions and the reference code. Such a two-phase decompilation process
facilitates advancing the correctness and readability of decompilation
independently. Our evaluations indicate that SK2Decompile, significantly
outperforms the SOTA baselines, achieving 21.6% average re-executability rate
gain over GPT-5-mini on the HumanEval dataset and 29.4% average R2I improvement
over Idioms on the GitHub2025 benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动化游戏测试方法在MMORPG这种复杂开放环境中难以实现高状态覆盖和效率，现有LLM方法对复杂游戏状态-动作空间的理解能力有限。

Method: TITAN包含四个核心组件：高维游戏状态感知与抽象、主动优化和优先处理可用动作、带动作轨迹记忆和自修正的长时程推理、基于LLM的预言机检测功能性和逻辑错误。

Result: 在两个大型商业MMORPG上测试，TITAN达到95%的任务完成率，检测性能优于现有方法，发现了四个先前未知的错误，并已在八个真实游戏QA流程中部署。

Conclusion: TITAN证明了LLM驱动框架在智能游戏测试中的有效性，为推进通用测试系统提供了新方向，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Testing MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games) is a
critical yet labor-intensive task in game development due to their complexity
and frequent updating nature. Traditional automated game testing approaches
struggle to achieve high state coverage and efficiency in these rich,
open-ended environments, while existing LLM-based game-playing approaches are
limited to shallow reasoning ability in understanding complex game state-action
spaces and long-complex tasks. To address these challenges, we propose TITAN,
an effective LLM-driven agent framework for intelligent MMORPG testing. TITAN
incorporates four key components to: (1) perceive and abstract high-dimensional
game states, (2) proactively optimize and prioritize available actions, (3)
enable long-horizon reasoning with action trace memory and reflective
self-correction, and (4) employ LLM-based oracles to detect potential
functional and logic bugs with diagnostic reports.
  We implement the prototype of TITAN and evaluate it on two large-scale
commercial MMORPGs spanning both PC and mobile platforms. In our experiments,
TITAN achieves significantly higher task completion rates (95%) and bug
detection performance compared to existing automated game testing approaches.
An ablation study further demonstrates that each core component of TITAN
contributes substantially to its overall performance. Notably, TITAN detects
four previously unknown bugs that prior testing approaches fail to identify. We
provide an in-depth discussion of these results, which offer guidance for new
avenues of advancing intelligent, general-purpose testing systems. Moreover,
TITAN has been deployed in eight real-world game QA pipelines, underscoring its
practical impact as an LLM-driven game testing framework.

Motivation: LLM在代码生成中经常产生库幻觉（发明不存在的库），这些幻觉可能误导开发者、破坏构建过程并带来供应链威胁。目前尚不清楚真实世界提示词变化如何影响幻觉率。

Method: 评估6个不同LLM在两种库幻觉类型上的表现：库名幻觉（无效导入）和库成员幻觉（有效库中的无效调用）。研究从开发者论坛提取的真实用户语言以及不同程度用户错误（单字符/多字符拼写错误、完全虚构名称/成员）对幻觉率的影响。

Result: 发现系统性漏洞：库名单字符拼写错误在高达26%的任务中触发幻觉，虚构库名在高达99%的任务中被接受，时间相关提示在高达84%的任务中导致幻觉。提示工程有缓解作用但不稳定且依赖具体LLM。

Conclusion: LLM对自然提示变化极其脆弱，迫切需要针对库相关幻觉及其潜在利用的安全保障措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate code, yet they
continue to hallucinate, often inventing non-existent libraries. Such library
hallucinations are not just benign errors: they can mislead developers, break
builds, and expose systems to supply chain threats such as slopsquatting.
Despite increasing awareness of these risks, little is known about how
real-world prompt variations affect hallucination rates. Therefore, we present
the first systematic study of how user-level prompt variations impact library
hallucinations in LLM-generated code. We evaluate six diverse LLMs across two
hallucination types: library name hallucinations (invalid imports) and library
member hallucinations (invalid calls from valid libraries). We investigate how
realistic user language extracted from developer forums and how user errors of
varying degrees (one- or multi-character misspellings and completely fake
names/members) affect LLM hallucination rates. Our findings reveal systemic
vulnerabilities: one-character misspellings in library names trigger
hallucinations in up to 26% of tasks, fake library names are accepted in up to
99% of tasks, and time-related prompts lead to hallucinations in up to 84% of
tasks. Prompt engineering shows promise for mitigating hallucinations, but
remains inconsistent and LLM-dependent. Our results underscore the fragility of
LLMs to natural prompt variation and highlight the urgent need for safeguards
against library-related hallucinations and their potential exploitation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了绿色提示工程的概念，通过实证研究发现提示的可读性会影响语言模型的能耗和性能，揭示了环境可持续性与性能之间的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在软件工程中的广泛应用，其推理过程引发的环境问题日益受到关注。先前研究主要关注硬件选择和提示长度，但很少关注语言复杂性这一可持续性因素。

Method: 使用开源小语言模型进行需求分类的实证研究，通过改变提示的可读性来考察其对能耗和性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现可读性确实影响环境可持续性和性能，在简单提示下可以降低能耗成本而不会显著损失F1分数。

Conclusion: 对于实践者，简单提示可以在不显著影响性能的情况下降低能耗；对于研究者，这为绿色AI议程中的可持续提示设计指南和研究开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Language Models are increasingly applied in software engineering, yet their
inference raises growing environmental concerns. Prior work has examined
hardware choices and prompt length, but little attention has been paid to
linguistic complexity as a sustainability factor. This paper introduces Green
Prompt Engineering, framing linguistic complexity as a design dimension that
can influence energy consumption and performance. We conduct an empirical study
on requirement classification using open-source Small Language Models, varying
the readability of prompts. Our results reveal that readability affects
environmental sustainability and performance, exposing trade-offs between them.
For practitioners, simpler prompts can reduce energy costs without a
significant F1-score loss; for researchers, it opens a path toward guidelines
and studies on sustainable prompt design within the Green AI agenda.

TL;DR: 提出了一种GPU加速的Loopy Belief Propagation算法，支持灵活更新策略，在程序分析中实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LBP在大型程序分析中面临计算挑战，现有GPU方法缺乏灵活更新策略支持且未整合逻辑约束，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出统一表示法支持任意用户定义更新策略，进行依赖分析，并基于Horn子句局部结构分组消息以减少warp分歧，优化GPU资源利用。

Result: 在8个真实Java程序的数据竞争分析实验中，相比最优串行方法平均加速2.14倍，相比最优GPU方法平均加速5.56倍，同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: GPU加速的LBP算法通过灵活更新策略和消息分组优化，在程序分析中实现了显著性能提升，为大规模推理问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) is a widely used approximate inference
algorithm in probabilistic graphical models, with applications in computer
vision, error correction codes, protein folding, program analysis, etc.
However, LBP faces significant computational challenges when applied to
large-scale program analysis. While GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) parallel
computing provides a promising solution, existing approaches lack support for
flexible update strategies and have yet to integrate logical constraints with
GPU acceleration, leading to suboptimal practical performance.
  This paper presents a GPU-accelerated LBP algorithm for program analysis. To
support the diverse update strategies required by users, we propose a unified
representation for specifying arbitrary user-defined update strategies, along
with a dependency analysis algorithm. Furthermore, building on previous work
that leverages the local structure of Horn clauses to simplify message passing,
we group messages to minimize warp divergence and better utilize GPU resources.
Experimental results on datarace analysis over eight real-world Java programs
show that our approach achieves an average speedup of $2.14\times$ over the
state-of-the-art sequential approach and $5.56\times$ over the state-of-the-art
GPU-based approach, while maintaining high accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究比较了四种自动驾驶测试模式（SiL、ViL、MR和真实世界测试），评估了它们在执行、感知和行为保真度三个维度上的现实差距，发现MR测试在提升感知真实性的同时保持了安全性和控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟测试与真实世界行为之间存在现实差距，这挑战了测试结果向实际部署系统的可转移性。需要系统评估不同测试模式在现实差距各维度上的表现。

Method: 使用配备真实传感器的小型物理车辆及其数字孪生，实现四种测试设置（SiL、ViL、MR和真实测试），在涉及真实障碍物、道路拓扑和室内环境的多样化驾驶场景中评估两种ADS架构（模块化和端到端）。

Result: SiL和ViL设置简化了真实世界动态和感知的关键方面，而MR测试在不影响安全或控制的情况下提高了感知真实性。识别了故障在不同测试模式间不转移的条件，并分离了导致这些差异的现实差距维度。

Conclusion: 研究结果为每种测试模式的优缺点提供了可操作的见解，并为实现更鲁棒和可转移的自动驾驶系统验证指明了方向。

Abstract: Simulation-based testing is a cornerstone of Autonomous Driving System (ADS)
development, offering safe and scalable evaluation across diverse driving
scenarios. However, discrepancies between simulated and real-world behavior,
known as the reality gap, challenge the transferability of test results to
deployed systems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study
comparing four representative testing modalities: Software-in-the-Loop (SiL),
Vehicle-in-the-Loop (ViL), Mixed-Reality (MR), and full real-world testing.
Using a small-scale physical vehicle equipped with real sensors (camera and
LiDAR) and its digital twin, we implement each setup and evaluate two ADS
architectures (modular and end-to-end) across diverse indoor driving scenarios
involving real obstacles, road topologies, and indoor environments. We
systematically assess the impact of each testing modality along three
dimensions of the reality gap: actuation, perception, and behavioral fidelity.
Our results show that while SiL and ViL setups simplify critical aspects of
real-world dynamics and sensing, MR testing improves perceptual realism without
compromising safety or control. Importantly, we identify the conditions under
which failures do not transfer across testing modalities and isolate the
underlying dimensions of the gap responsible for these discrepancies. Our
findings offer actionable insights into the respective strengths and
limitations of each modality and outline a path toward more robust and
transferable validation of autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: 上下文特定的错误定位指导比抽象指南或无上下文的具体步骤更有效，能更快提升新手技能并保持长期效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新手在错误定位时缺乏系统性方法，现有研究测试了抽象指南和通用步骤，但上下文特定指导的影响尚不明确。

Method: 进行为期八周的纵向研究，设置四个条件：无指导(G1)、抽象指南(G2)、具体步骤(G3)、以及结合具体步骤和问题特定细节的上下文特定指导(G4)。44名本科生参与，完成5个会话的调试任务。

Result: G4组在第一个会话后达到80%正确率（其他组为20-44%），并在三周后仍保持80%正确率，显著优于其他组(p<0.05)。G4组完成时间稳定在13-15分钟，而其他组需要2-3个会话才能稳定在22-27分钟。

Conclusion: 上下文特定指导能更快获得技能并保持更强记忆效果，即使1-2个会话也能产生显著提升。将上下文示例与抽象原则结合可以弥合错误定位教育中的理论与实践差距，为新手提供更公平的学习路径。

Abstract: Bug localization is a critical skill, yet novices often lack systematic
approaches. Prior work tested abstract guidelines and general concrete steps;
the impact of context-specific instruction is unclear. We ran an eight-week
longitudinal study with four conditions: no instruction (G1), abstract
guidelines (G2), concrete steps (G3), and our context-specific instruction that
pairs concrete bug-localization steps with problem-specific details (G4).
Forty-four undergraduates participated; 41 completed all five sessions (S1-S5).
Each session included 2-3 debugging tasks to identify the minimal code element
containing a seeded logical fault. We measured correctness (binary), time to
completion, self-perceived scores (stress, difficulty, satisfaction, and
strategy adherence). G4 achieved higher correctness and shorter time to
completion: it reached 80% correctness after one session (vs. 20-44% for other
groups) and maintained 80% after three weeks, outperforming all groups (p <
0.05); its time to completion stabilized at 13-15 minutes in S1, whereas other
groups took 2-3 sessions to stabilize at 22-27 minutes. Qualitative responses
showed lower stress and higher satisfaction in G4, with participants
internalizing strategies via contextual examples. We conclude that
context-specific instruction yields faster skill acquisition and stronger
retention than abstract guidelines or context-agnostic steps. Even 1-2 sessions
produced significant gains, while extended practice optimized and stabilized
performance. Integrating contextual examples with abstract principles may
bridge theory-practice gaps in bug-localization education and provide a more
equitable path for novices.

TL;DR: TreeMind结合大型语言模型和蒙特卡洛树搜索，通过战略性的UI探索来自动复现Android应用崩溃问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习或LLM的方法在复现不完整错误报告时存在局限，难以推断未观察步骤和重建用户操作序列来导航复杂的UI交互空间。

Method: 将复现任务建模为目标驱动搜索问题，使用MCTS作为核心规划机制，引入两个LLM引导的智能体：Expander生成有前景的操作，Simulator估计操作成功概率。

Result: 在93个真实Android错误报告数据集上评估，TreeMind在复现成功率上显著优于四种最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 将LLM推理与MCTS规划相结合是自动化错误复现的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Automatically reproducing Android app crashes from textual bug reports is
challenging, particularly when the reports are incomplete and the modern UI
exhibits high combinatorial complexity. Existing approaches based on
reinforcement learning or large language models (LLMs) exhibit limitations in
such scenarios. They struggle to infer unobserved steps and reconstruct the
underlying user action sequences to navigate the vast UI interaction space,
primarily due to limited goal-directed reasoning and planning. We present
TreeMind, a novel technique that integrates LLMs with a customized Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to achieve strategic UI exploration in bug
reproduction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to combine
external decision-making with LLM semantic reasoning for reliable bug
reproduction. We formulate the reproduction task as a target-driven search
problem, leveraging MCTS as the core planning mechanism to iteratively refine
action sequences. To enhance MCTS with semantic reasoning, we introduce two
LLM-guided agents with distinct roles: Expander generates top-k promising
actions based on the current UI state and exploration history, while Simulator
estimates the likelihood that each action leads toward successful reproduction.
By incorporating multi-modal UI inputs and advanced prompting techniques,
TreeMind conducts feedback-aware navigation that identifies missing but
essential user actions and incrementally reconstructs the reproduction paths.
We evaluate TreeMind on a dataset of 93 real-world Android bug reports from
three widely-used benchmarks. Experimental results show that it significantly
outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in reproduction success rate. A
real-world case study indicates that integrating LLM reasoning with MCTS-based
planning is a compelling direction for automated bug reproduction.

TL;DR: AFD是一种增强指针分析的新技术，通过自动识别和建模自定义分配函数来提高分析精度，在15个真实C项目中识别600+自定义分配函数，使堆对象建模增加26倍，别名集大小减少39%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指针分析方法大多忽略C/C++程序中普遍存在的自定义分配函数，导致粗糙的别名分析和降低的分析精度。

Method: AFD采用混合方法：使用值流分析检测简单包装器，利用大型语言模型(LLM)推理具有副作用的复杂分配模式，实现精确的堆对象建模。

Result: 在15个真实C项目中识别600+自定义分配函数，堆对象建模增加26倍，别名集大小减少39%，运行时开销仅1.4倍，发现17个未检测的内存错误。

Conclusion: 精确建模自定义分配函数为改进大型软件系统中的指针分析提供了可扩展且实用的路径。

Abstract: Pointer analysis is foundational for many static analysis tasks, yet its
effectiveness is often hindered by imprecise modeling of heap allocations,
particularly in C/C++ programs where user-defined allocation functions (AFs)
are pervasive. Existing approaches largely overlook these custom allocators,
leading to coarse aliasing and reduced analysis precision. In this paper, we
present AFD, a novel technique that enhances pointer analysis by automatically
identifying and modeling custom allocation functions. AFD employs a hybrid
approach: it uses value-flow analysis to detect straightforward wrappers and
leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason about more complex allocation
patterns with side effects. This targeted enhancement enables precise modeling
of heap objects at each call site, achieving context-sensitivity-like benefits
without the associated overhead. We evaluate AFD on 15 real-world C projects,
identifying over 600 custom AFs. Integrating AFD into a baseline pointer
analysis yields a 26x increase in modeled heap objects and a 39% reduction in
alias set sizes, with only 1.4x runtime overhead. Furthermore, our enhanced
analysis improves indirect call resolution and uncovers 17 previously
undetected memory bugs. These results demonstrate that precise modeling of
custom allocation functions offers a scalable and practical path to improving
pointer analysis in large software systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合智能路由框架，将监督机器学习与AODV路由协议相结合，通过四个预测模型动态评估邻居节点，在蓝牙Mesh网络中显著提高了数据包传输成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AODV路由策略在拥塞和动态拓扑变化下性能下降，蓝牙Mesh网络在紧急和资源受限场景中需要更可靠的路由方案。

Method: 开发了混合智能路由框架，集成四个预测模型：投递成功率分类器、TTL回归器、延迟回归器、转发器适用性分类器，通过统一评分机制动态排序邻居节点。

Result: 在10种场景测试中，完整混合模型(ABCD)实现了约99.97%的数据包投递率，显著优于基准AODV和部分混合模型。

Conclusion: 轻量级、可解释的机器学习模型能够增强蓝牙Mesh网络的路由可靠性和适应性，特别适合基础设施缺失且投递成功率优先于延迟约束的环境。

Abstract: Bluetooth-based mesh networks offer a promising infrastructure for offline
communication in emergency and resource constrained scenarios. However,
traditional routing strategies such as Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV)
often degrade under congestion and dynamic topological changes. This study
proposes a hybrid intelligent routing framework that augments AODV with
supervised machine learning to improve next-hop selection under varied network
constraints. The framework integrates four predictive models: a delivery
success classifier, a TTL regressor, a delay regressor, and a forwarder
suitability classifier, into a unified scoring mechanism that dynamically ranks
neighbors during multi-hop message transmission. A simulation environment with
stationary node deployments was developed, incorporating buffer constraints and
device heterogeneity to evaluate three strategies: baseline AODV, a partial
hybrid ML model (ABC), and the full hybrid ML model (ABCD). Across ten
scenarios, the Hybrid ABCD model achieves approximately 99.97 percent packet
delivery under these controlled conditions, significantly outperforming both
the baseline and intermediate approaches. The results demonstrate that
lightweight, explainable machine learning models can enhance routing
reliability and adaptability in Bluetooth mesh networks, particularly in
infrastructure-less environments where delivery success is prioritized over
latency constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传输协议在网络通信中至关重要，但面临着协议多样性和执行环境差异的挑战，需要一种高级、目标无关的编程抽象来简化开发。

Method: 将传输协议规范为高级程序，采用类似C语言的约束构造，以事件和流状态为输入，生成更新状态和目标无关的指令。开发了TINF框架和两个后端实现（DPDK和Linux eXpress DataPath）。

Result: 成功在TINF框架中开发了多种传输协议，并在两个后端平台上部署运行，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 目标无关的传输程序可以减少传输协议开发工作量，支持自动化分析和形式验证，并促进可编程传输协议目标的研究。

Abstract: Transport protocols are fundamental to network communications, continuously
evolving to meet the demands of new applications, workloads, and network
architectures while running in a wide range of execution environments (a.k.a
targets). We argue that this diversity across protocols and targets calls for a
high-level, target-agnostic programming abstraction for the transport layer.
Specifically, we propose to specify transport protocols as high-level programs
that take an event and flow state as input, and using constrained C-like
constructs, produce the updated state along with target-agnostic instructions
for key transport operations such as data reassembly, packet generation and
scheduling, and timer manipulations.
  We show the benefits of our high-level transport programs by developing
multiple transport protocols in our programming framework called TINF,
developing two TINF- compliant backends, one in DPDK and one in Linux eXpress
DataPath, and deploying TINF programs for multiple protocols across both
backends. Inspired by the benefits unlocked by L2/L3 packet-processing
languages like P4, we believe target-agnostic transport programs can reduce the
development effort for transport protocols, enable automated analysis and
formal verification of the transport layer, and further research in
programmable targets for transport protocols.

Motivation: 随着可编程网络硬件的发展，越来越多的功能可以从通用CPU软件迁移到NIC上。早期NIC只支持卸载固定功能，而现代NIC如Nvidia Bluefield-3允许完全可编程的数据平面。

Method: 在Bluefield-3上开发名为XenoFlow的负载均衡器，并评估Bluefield-3 eSwitch的能力和限制。

Result: 当Flow Pipe中只有2个条目时，Bluefield-3无法达到线速。但XenoFlow相比主机端eBPF负载均衡器延迟降低44%，且在高负载下仍能保持低延迟。

Conclusion: 硬件卸载到NIC并靠近网络具有优势，但Bluefield-3在Flow Pipe条目较少时存在性能限制。

Abstract: With the advent of programmable network hardware, more and more
  functionality can be moved from software running on general purpose CPUs to
  the NIC. Early NICs only allowed offloading fixed functions like checksum
  computation. Recent NICs like the Nvidia Bluefield-3 allow a fully
  programmable dataplane. In this paper, we present our first steps towards a
  load balancer named XenoFlow running on the Bluefield-3. Furthermore, we
  show the capabilities and limitations of the Bluefield-3 eSwitch. Our
  results show that the Bluefield-3 will not achieve line rate with only 2
  entries in a Flow Pipe. However, we also show the adventages of hardware
  offloading on the NIC and being closer to the network. With XenoFlow, we
  achieve an 44% lower latency compared to a comparable eBPF-based load
  balancer running on the host. Furthermore, XenoFlow achieves this low
  latency even under high load.

predicts signal behaviour and enables efficient resource allocation. The
framework ensures seamless HOs and improved system performance by facilitating

incorporating mechanisms to mitigate the ping-pong effect. Comparative

Method: 首先从杂货店销售数据中发现连续时间马尔可夫链形式的随机过程模型，然后扩展供应活动，最后进行假设分析评估产品数量随时间变化。

Result: 能够识别客户购买行为与供应策略之间的最优平衡，帮助预防食物浪费和产品短缺。

Conclusion: 该方法为食品零售流程分析提供了有效工具，有助于减少食物浪费并优化供应链管理。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for analyzing food retail processes with a
focus on reducing food waste. The approach integrates object-centric process
mining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. First, a
stochastic process in the form of a continuous-time Markov chain is discovered
from grocery store sales data. This model is then extended with supply
activities. Finally, a what-if analysis is conducted to evaluate how the
quantity of products in the store evolves over time. This enables the
identification of an optimal balance between customer purchasing behavior and
supply strategies, helping to prevent both food waste due to oversupply and
product shortages.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种联邦多模态钓鱼网站检测器，支持URL、HTML和图像输入，无需在推理时绑定客户端到固定模态。采用基于FedProx的角色感知桶聚合方法，使用硬门控选择模态专家，实现模态特定参数的分离聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中多模态检测的挑战，避免跨模态嵌入冲突，在严格隐私保护下实现稳定的联邦训练，同时提高多模态钓鱼检测的可用性和灵活性。

Method: 在FedProx基础上提出角色感知桶聚合，受Mixture-of-Experts和FedMM启发。使用硬门控（按样本模态选择IMAGE/HTML/URL专家）而非可学习路由，分离聚合模态特定参数。URL使用GraphCodeBERT，HTML使用早期三路嵌入处理原始噪声数据。

Result: 在TR-OP数据集上，融合头达到97.5%准确率和2.4%误报率；图像子集达到95.5%准确率和5.9%误报率。在WebPhish（HTML）上获得96.5%准确率和1.8%误报率；在TR-OP（原始HTML）上获得95.1%准确率和4.6%误报率。

Conclusion: 桶聚合与硬门控专家相结合，能够在严格隐私保护下实现稳定的联邦训练，同时显著提升多模态钓鱼检测的实用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We present a federated, multi-modal phishing website detector that supports
URL, HTML, and IMAGE inputs without binding clients to a fixed modality at
inference: any client can invoke any modality head trained elsewhere.
Methodologically, we propose role-aware bucket aggregation on top of FedProx,
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts and FedMM. We drop learnable routing and use
hard gating (selecting the IMAGE/HTML/URL expert by sample modality), enabling
separate aggregation of modality-specific parameters to isolate cross-embedding
conflicts and stabilize convergence. On TR-OP, the Fusion head reaches Acc
97.5% with FPR 2.4% across two data types; on the image subset (ablation) it
attains Acc 95.5% with FPR 5.9%. For text, we use GraphCodeBERT for URLs and an
early three-way embedding for raw, noisy HTML. On WebPhish (HTML) we obtain Acc
96.5% / FPR 1.8%; on TR-OP (raw HTML) we obtain Acc 95.1% / FPR 4.6%. Results
indicate that bucket aggregation with hard-gated experts enables stable
federated training under strict privacy, while improving the usability and
flexibility of multi-modal phishing detection.

<details>

Motivation: 物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在求解偏微分方程时对损失权重选择高度敏感，需要更平衡的训练策略。

Method: 提出了两种基于维度分析的权重方案：一种基于可量化项，另一种还结合了不可量化项。

Result: 在热传导、对流扩散和盖驱动腔流等基准测试中，第二种方案相比等权重方法显著提高了稳定性和精度，特别是在高Peclet数对流扩散问题中实现了稳定准确的预测。

Conclusion: 该权重方案增强了PINNs在计算流体动力学问题中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为传统求解器难以处理的问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks offer a mesh free framework for solving PDEs
but are highly sensitive to loss weight selection. We propose two dimensional
analysis based weighting schemes, one based on quantifiable terms, and another
also incorporating unquantifiable terms for more balanced training. Benchmarks
on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid driven cavity flows show that
the second scheme consistently improves stability and accuracy over equal
weighting. Notably, in high Peclet number convection diffusion, where
traditional solvers fail, PINNs with our scheme achieve stable, accurate
predictions, highlighting their robustness and generalizability in CFD
problems.

Motivation: 验证LLMs是否能够作为通用实验设计代理进行上下文实验设计

Method: 使用开源和闭源指令调优LLMs评估遗传扰动和分子属性发现任务，提出LLMNN混合方法结合LLM先验知识和最近邻采样

Result: LLM代理对实验反馈不敏感，经典方法如线性bandits和高斯过程优化表现更好，LLMNN方法在不同领域达到竞争性或更优性能

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在实践中无法进行上下文实验设计，需要将基于先验的推理与更新后验的批量获取解耦的混合框架

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose
agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context
experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and
closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and
molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no
sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly
permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical
methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently
outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided
Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with
nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves
competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring
significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and
closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice
and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based
reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据自由持续模型融合中如何在没有任务数据的情况下确保透明度（不干扰先前任务）和保真度（忠实适应新任务）的挑战。

Method: 使用零空间投影器过滤新任务向量中的重叠组件确保透明度，结合轻量级LoRA适配器注入任务特定信号实现保真度，通过投影基代理损失训练适配器。

Result: 在视觉和NLP基准测试中达到最先进性能，平均准确率比OPCM和WUDI-Merging提高4-7%，减少遗忘并降低计算开销。

Conclusion: NUFILT通过联合过滤-适应过程有效吸收新知识同时保留现有行为，理论上有子空间对齐保证，实证表现优异。

Abstract: Data-free continual model merging (DFCMM) aims to fuse independently
fine-tuned models into a single backbone that evolves with incoming tasks
without accessing task data. This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata
for DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and
fidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that
existing approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with
parameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence
of task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a
data-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our
key observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation
subspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and
fidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior
responses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby
ensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects
complementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new
tasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain
consistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This
joint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge
while retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a
layer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost.
Theoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that
justify null-space filtering. Empirically, NUFILT achieves state-of-the-art
performance with minimal forgetting on both vision and NLP benchmarks,
improving average accuracy by 4-7% over OPCM and WUDI-Merging, while narrowing
the gap to fine-tuning and reducing computation overhead.

Motivation: 为支持牛顿噪声抑制和实时观测控制，开发数据驱动的地震预测方法，为未来引力波探测器提供可靠的地面运动预测。

Method: 采用自回归训练的Transformer模型，直接从波形数据中学习时空依赖性，支持单站和阵列输入。

Result: 模型在即时预测窗口内表现良好，随着预测时间延长性能逐渐下降，符合自回归系统的预期特性。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的地震预测奠定了基础，有望支持引力波探测器的噪声抑制和实时控制。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting
three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave
detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an
autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based
inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform
data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate
short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the
immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected
in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven
seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time
observatory control.

<details>

Conclusion: 基于推理的LLM方法提供了可解释的决策树，允许人工纠正偏见和融入领域知识，是表格基础模型的有价值替代方案。

Abstract: Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource
tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by
pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained
via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model
becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In
this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to
induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a
minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision
trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning
from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional
CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not
outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable
reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the
reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input:
correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not
captured in the data.

Result: 在CIFAR和CelebA数据集上实现了幂等模型的最先进结果，推理速度比迭代分数模型更快。

Conclusion: SIGN成功结合了扩散模型的稳定性和IGNs的高效性，支持质量与效率的权衡，并能进行零样本输入编辑。

Abstract: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models
based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and
multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational
cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training
instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular
approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one
distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models
have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity
generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of
high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along
the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and
consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even
perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite
diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores,
called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require
adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed
score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively
distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than
iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing
users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the
source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto
the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our
models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for
idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.

Motivation: 重新定义幻觉为损失最小化与人类可接受输出之间的结构性错配，揭示幻觉是校准错误导致的估计误差。

Method: 通过概率下界分析证明通用数据分布下的幻觉率，并在硬币聚合、开放问答和文生图任务中进行实验验证。

Result: 实验证实了理论预测，显示最优估计器仍会产生幻觉，支持幻觉是结构性问题的观点。

Conclusion: 幻觉是损失最小化目标与人类期望输出之间的根本性错配问题，而非简单的模型缺陷。

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an
estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even
loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a
general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data
distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between
loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors
induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and
text-to-image support our theory.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) have achieved competitive performance
in text generation, improving their reasoning ability with reinforcement
learning remains an active research area. Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning
framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy
gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate
the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation
for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are
particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation.
We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key
for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves
over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on
supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs
on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks
(GSM8K and MATH500).

Conclusion: 通过提供高质量基准和鲁棒模型，为数据不确定性下的海洋科学研究建立了坚实基础基础设施

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields,
from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth
science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready
benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we
first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark
derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising.
Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction
paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of
missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its
ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of
observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical
state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that
efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with
geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of
computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the
challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the
KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme
data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust
model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research
under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at:

Conclusion: 保形数据增强是一种简单有效的原则性方法，能够显著提升模型性能，且实现成本低。

Abstract: With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications,
synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the
demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in
expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while
introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical:
effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same
underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this
paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering
framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse
synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk
control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal
model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic
prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection,
showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score over
unaugmented baselines, and 4% over other filtered augmentation baselines.

Motivation: 前馈神经网络的逻辑很大程度上体现在内部层神经元的激活状态中，需要自动提取这些状态来推断网络的形式化属性。

Method: 基于神经元激活状态（数值或开关状态）提取规则作为前提条件，这些规则隐含了期望的输出行为，如特定类别的预测。

Conclusion: Prophecy在大规模视觉语言模型时代具有重要潜力，能够自动推断和证明神经网络的形式化属性。

Abstract: We present Prophecy, a tool for automatically inferring formal properties of
feed-forward neural networks. Prophecy is based on the observation that a
significant part of the logic of feed-forward networks is captured in the
activation status of the neurons at inner layers. Prophecy works by extracting
rules based on neuron activations (values or on/off statuses) as preconditions
that imply certain desirable output property, e.g., the prediction being a
certain class. These rules represent network properties captured in the hidden
layers that imply the desired output behavior. We present the architecture of
the tool, highlight its features and demonstrate its usage on different types
of models and output properties. We present an overview of its applications,
such as inferring and proving formal explanations of neural networks,
compositional verification, run-time monitoring, repair, and others. We also
show novel results highlighting its potential in the era of large
vision-language models.

Abstract: We study distributed learning in the setting of gradient-free zero-order
optimization and introduce FedZero, a federated zero-order algorithm that
delivers sharp theoretical guarantees. Specifically, FedZero: (1) achieves
near-optimal optimization error bounds with high probability in the federated
convex setting; and (2) in the single-worker regime-where the problem reduces
to the standard zero-order framework, establishes the first high-probability
convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization, thereby
strengthening the classical expectation-based results. At its core, FedZero
employs a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_1$-sphere.
To analyze it, we develop new concentration inequalities for Lipschitz
functions under the uniform measure on the $\ell_1$-sphere, with explicit
constants. These concentration tools are not only central to our
high-probability guarantees but may also be of independent interest.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface
reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture
(TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed
parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs).
Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high
accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing
calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support
problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural
operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional
functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility
of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed
modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained
neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These
include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator,
tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev
norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and
reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical
processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by
computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by
computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic
modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of
calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional
methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex
reservoir systems.

*Dmitry Eremeev,Oleg Platonov,Gleb Bazhenov,Artem Babenko,Liudmila Prokhorenkova*

TL;DR: GraphPFN：一种基于先验数据拟合网络的节点级预测方法，通过在合成图上预训练增强表格基础模型，实现了在真实图数据集上的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基础模型主要依赖手工制作的图特征，限制了学习复杂图特定模式的能力。需要开发能够捕捉图结构依赖性的基础模型。

Method: 设计合成属性图的先验分布，使用随机块模型和优先连接过程生成图结构，应用图感知结构化因果模型生成节点属性和目标。在合成图上训练增强的表格基础模型LimiX，加入基于注意力的图邻域聚合层。

Result: 在多达50,000个节点的多样化真实图数据集上，GraphPFN表现出强大的上下文学习能力，并在微调后达到最先进的结果，在大多数数据集上优于G2T-FM和从头训练的任务特定GNN。

Conclusion: 在精心设计的先验分布上对合成图进行预训练是构建图基础模型的有效策略。

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such
fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their
application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation
models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and
were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However,
these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their
ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose
GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we
design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure
generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and
a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal
models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to
efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment
the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood
aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior,
allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in
tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes,
GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves
state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and
task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our
work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed
prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation
models.

*Arani Roy,Shristi Das Biswas,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SlimDiff是一个无需梯度训练、基于激活信息的扩散模型结构压缩框架，通过谱近似方法动态修剪注意力层和前馈层维度，实现35%加速和约1亿参数减少，仅需500个校准样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成性能优秀，但存在计算成本高的问题。现有的效率优化技术（如量化、时间步减少或剪枝）严重依赖微调或重新训练来恢复性能，存在瓶颈。

Method: 将扩散模型压缩重构为谱近似任务，利用去噪时间步中的激活协方差定义低秩子空间，在固定压缩预算下指导动态剪枝。采用模块化分解方法处理功能权重组，并自适应分配稀疏度。

Result: 在基线模型基础上实现35%加速和约1亿参数减少，生成质量与未压缩模型相当，无需任何反向传播，仅需约500个校准样本，比先前方法少70倍以上。

Conclusion: 这是第一个基于闭式解、激活引导的扩散模型结构压缩方法，完全无需训练，提供了理论清晰性和实际效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are
computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative
denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization,
timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime
but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to
recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated
activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both
attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely
gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation
task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank
subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This
activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by
applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key
interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than
isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across
modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff
achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over
baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any
backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration
samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is
the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is
entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical
efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出基于评分标准的奖励机制来解决强化微调中的奖励过度优化问题，通过利用离策略示例来区分高质量回答，有效缓解奖励信号被模型利用的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化微调常面临奖励过度优化问题，即模型通过操纵奖励信号获得高分但生成低质量输出。理论分析表明关键在于高奖励区域的奖励规范不足，无法可靠区分优秀和良好回答。

Method: 研究基于评分标准的奖励机制，利用离策略示例（如来自更强模型或重写的示例）来捕获高奖励尾部分布，同时保持对策略模型的对齐不敏感。提出区分优秀且多样化回答的工作流程。

Result: 实证研究表明基于评分标准的奖励显著缓解了奖励过度优化问题，并实现了有效的LLM后训练改进。

Conclusion: 基于评分标准的奖励机制是解决强化微调中奖励过度优化问题的有效方法，能够利用离策略示例来提升模型对齐效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward
over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve
high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the
inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones.
This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail
examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from
stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them
yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this,
we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy
examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that
capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing
among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this
idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially
mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training
improvements. Our code can be accessed at

Motivation: 现有表示学习方法在平衡迁移能力和任务多样性方面存在挑战，MIM虽然能最大化输入与潜在变量间的互信息并促进编码聚类，但在判别任务上表现不足。

Method: cMIM在MIM基础上引入对比目标，施加全局判别结构；提出信息嵌入技术从编码器-解码器模型中提取增强特征；无需正样本数据增强，对批量大小敏感度低。

Result: 在视觉和分子基准测试中，cMIM在分类和回归任务上优于MIM和InfoNCE，同时保持竞争力的重建质量。

Conclusion: cMIM作为统一的表示学习框架，推进了同时有效服务于判别性和生成性应用的模型目标。

Abstract: Learning representations that transfer well to diverse downstream tasks
remains a central challenge in representation learning. Existing paradigms --
contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders --
balance this challenge with different trade-offs. We introduce the {contrastive
Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the
Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a contrastive objective. While MIM
maximizes mutual information between inputs and latents and promotes clustering
of codes, it falls short on discriminative tasks. cMIM addresses this gap by
imposing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative
fidelity. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose cMIM, a
contrastive extension of MIM that removes the need for positive data
augmentation and is substantially less sensitive to batch size than InfoNCE.
Second, we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for
extracting enriched features from encoder-decoder models that boosts
discriminative performance without additional training and applies broadly
beyond MIM. Third, we provide empirical evidence across vision and molecular
benchmarks showing that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on classification and
regression tasks while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. These
results position cMIM as a unified framework for representation learning,
advancing the goal of models that serve both discriminative and generative
applications effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型的反向时间速度可能变得刚性且隐含无限传播速度，Kac动力学通过有限速度传输确保全局有界动能，提高数值稳定性。

Method: 使用阻尼波动方程和随机Kac表示，在速度空间引入无分类器引导，提出端点蒸馏方法训练学生模型匹配教师模型。

Result: 实验表明DistillKac能以极少的函数评估次数生成高质量样本，同时保持有限速度概率流的数值稳定性优势。

Conclusion: DistillKac结合有限速度传输和蒸馏技术，在保持稳定性的同时实现了高效的图像生成。

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave
equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at
finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can
become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics
enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy.
Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity
space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then
propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen
teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes
supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments
demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function
evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed
probability flows.

Abstract: The main focus of research on Knowledge Tracing (KT) models is on model
developments with the aim of improving predictive accuracy. Most of these

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然grokking现象已被广泛研究，但缺乏一个数学框架来系统描述复杂结构化输入中特征的出现方式、机制和条件。

Method: 提出了Li₂框架，通过分析跨层反向传播梯度G_F的结构来表征三个训练阶段，并研究能量函数E的局部极值所诱导的特征。

Result: 揭示了权重衰减、学习率和样本大小等超参数在grokking中的作用，证明了记忆和泛化的可扩展规律，并解释了Muon等优化器有效的根本原因。

Conclusion: 该研究从梯度动力学的基本原理出发，为理解grokking现象提供了数学框架，并可扩展到多层架构。

Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been
studied extensively, it remains an open question whether there is a
mathematical framework to characterize what kind of features emerge, how and in
which conditions it happens from training, for complex structured inputs. We
propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key
stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy
learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature
learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$
across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden
representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only
depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their
representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about
target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics
follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local
maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima
induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they
change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we
provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on
missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles
played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample
sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and
generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as
Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our
analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有半监督学习框架的关键限制，包括静态视图交互、不可靠的伪标签以及缺乏困难样本建模等问题。

Method: 将SSL构建为三个角色的结构化交互：两个在冻结互补表示上训练的学生分类器、通过验证反馈自适应调节伪标签选择和损失平衡的元学习教师，以及扰动嵌入以揭示决策边界弱点的非参数生成器。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、SVHN、STL-10和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，TRiCo在低标签机制下始终实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRiCo提供了一个原则性和可推广的解决方案，同时保持架构无关性并与冻结视觉骨干网络兼容。

Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that
rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher,
two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm.
Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL
as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers
trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher
that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via
validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs
embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected
based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust
measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a
Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students
follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in
existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable
pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled
and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10,
and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and
compatible with frozen vision backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的安全方法RLHF在训练阶段有效，但在推理阶段无法防止有害内容的生成，需要一种在推理时提供安全保障的机制。

Method: 将自回归生成建模为潜在空间中的动态系统，通过反向可达性学习安全价值函数，估计轨迹的最坏情况演化，实现运行时监控和转向滤波。

Result: 在多个LLM和毒性基准测试中，BRT-Align比基线方法更准确、更早地检测到不安全延续，显著减少有害生成，同时保持句子多样性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 可达性分析为推理时LLM安全提供了原则性和实用的基础，能够持续产生更少暴力、粗俗、冒犯和政治偏见的内容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising
urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The
dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
-- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards
at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose
BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety
tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a
dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward
reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables
two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe
completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering
filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from
unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks
demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of
unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment,
BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence
diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent
alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less
violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together,
these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and
practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely used strategy to improve model robustness and
generalization by enriching training datasets with synthetic examples. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities
for this purpose, their applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare
present unique challenges due to the risk of generating clinically incorrect or

collaboration framework that integrates expert-level domain knowledge to guide
the augmentation process to preserve critical medical information. Experiments
on clinical prediction tasks demonstrate that our lightweight
collaboration-based approach consistently outperforms existing LLM augmentation
methods while improving safety through reduced factual errors. This framework
addresses the gap between LLM augmentation potential and the safety
requirements of specialized domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, the ability to use
information provided as context to improve prediction of future tokens.
Induction heads have been argued to play a crucial role for in-context learning
in Transformer Language Models. These attention heads make a token attend to
successors of past occurrences of the same token in the input. This basic
mechanism supports LLMs' ability to copy and predict repeating patterns.
However, it is unclear if this same mechanism can support in-context learning
of more complex repetitive patterns with hierarchical structure. Natural
language is teeming with such cases: The article "the" in English usually
prefaces multiple nouns in a text. When predicting which token succeeds a
particular instance of "the", we need to integrate further contextual cues from
the text to predict the correct noun. If induction heads naively attend to all
past instances of successor tokens of "the" in a context-independent manner,
they cannot support this level of contextual information integration. In this
study, we design a synthetic in-context learning task, where tokens are
repeated with hierarchical dependencies. Here, attending uniformly to all
successor tokens is not sufficient to accurately predict future tokens.
Evaluating a range of LLMs on these token sequences and natural language
analogues, we find adaptive induction heads that support prediction by learning
what to attend to in-context. Next, we investigate how induction heads
themselves learn in-context. We find evidence that learning is supported by
attention heads that uncover a set of latent contexts, determining the
different token transition relationships. Overall, we not only show that LLMs
have induction heads that learn, but offer a complete mechanistic account of
how LLMs learn to predict higher-order repetitive patterns in-context.

Conclusion: LLM表现出有限的元认知能力，这些能力与人脑存在质的不同，且模型后训练可能在发展元认知能力中发挥作用。

Abstract: The possibility of LLM self-awareness and even sentience is gaining
increasing public attention and has major safety and policy implications, but
the science of measuring them is still in a nascent state. Here we introduce a
novel methodology for quantitatively evaluating metacognitive abilities in
LLMs. Taking inspiration from research on metacognition in nonhuman animals,
our approach eschews model self-reports and instead tests to what degree models
can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states. Using two experimental
paradigms, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs introduced since early 2024 show
increasingly strong evidence of certain metacognitive abilities, specifically
the ability to assess and utilize their own confidence in their ability to
answer factual and reasoning questions correctly and the ability to anticipate
what answers they would give and utilize that information appropriately. We
buttress these behavioral findings with an analysis of the token probabilities
returned by the models, which suggests the presence of an upstream internal
signal that could provide the basis for metacognition. We further find that
these abilities 1) are limited in resolution, 2) emerge in context-dependent
manners, and 3) seem to be qualitatively different from those of humans. We
also report intriguing differences across models of similar capabilities,
suggesting that LLM post-training may have a role in developing metacognitive
abilities.

Conclusion: 本书系统性地提供了处理机器学习中不确定性选择问题的统计工具，涵盖了从基础集中不等式到复杂学习场景的理论保证方法。

Abstract: Learning, whether natural or artificial, is a process of selection. It starts
with a set of candidate options and selects the more successful ones. In the
case of machine learning the selection is done based on empirical estimates of
prediction accuracy of candidate prediction rules on some data. Due to
randomness of data sampling the empirical estimates are inherently noisy,
leading to selection under uncertainty. The book provides statistical tools to
obtain theoretical guarantees on the outcome of selection under uncertainty. We
start with concentration of measure inequalities, which are the main
statistical instrument for controlling how much an empirical estimate of
expectation of a function deviates from the true expectation. The book covers a
broad range of inequalities, including Markov's, Chebyshev's, Hoeffding's,
Bernstein's, Empirical Bernstein's, Unexpected Bernstein's, kl, and split-kl.
We then study the classical (offline) supervised learning and provide a range
of tools for deriving generalization bounds, including Occam's razor,
Vapnik-Chervonenkis analysis, and PAC-Bayesian analysis. The latter is further
applied to derive generalization guarantees for weighted majority votes. After
covering the offline setting, we turn our attention to online learning. We
present the space of online learning problems characterized by environmental
feedback, environmental resistance, and structural complexity. A common
performance measure in online learning is regret, which compares performance of
an algorithm to performance of the best prediction rule in hindsight, out of a
restricted set of prediction rules. We present tools for deriving regret bounds
in stochastic and adversarial environments, and under full information and
bandit feedback.

Abstract: Switching dynamical systems can model complicated time series data while
maintaining interpretability by inferring a finite set of dynamics primitives
and explaining different portions of the observed time series with one of these
primitives. However, due to the discrete nature of this set, such models
struggle to capture smooth, variable-speed transitions, as well as stochastic
mixtures of overlapping states, and the inferred dynamics often display
spurious rapid switching on real-world datasets. Here, we propose the Gumbel
Dynamical Model (GDM). First, by introducing a continuous relaxation of
discrete states and a different noise model defined on the relaxed-discrete
state space via the Gumbel distribution, GDM expands the set of available state
dynamics, allowing the model to approximate smoother and non-stationary
ground-truth dynamics more faithfully. Second, the relaxation makes the model
fully differentiable, enabling fast and scalable training with standard
gradient descent methods. We validate our approach on standard simulation
datasets and highlight its ability to model soft, sticky states and transitions
in a stochastic setting. Furthermore, we apply our model to two real-world
datasets, demonstrating its ability to infer interpretable states in stochastic
time series with multiple dynamics, a setting where traditional methods often
fail.

Abstract: In this digital era, online shopping is common practice in our daily lives.
Product reviews significantly influence consumer buying behavior and help

this trust by potentially misleading consumers and damaging the reputations of
the sellers. This research addresses this pressing issue by employing advanced
big data analytics and machine learning approaches on a substantial dataset of

study illustrates the utility of various machine learning classifiers in
detecting spam reviews, with Logistic Regression achieving an accuracy of
90.35%, thus contributing to a more trustworthy and transparent online shopping
environment.

Abstract: Operator learning is a recently developed generalization of regression to
mappings between functions. It promises to drastically reduce expensive
numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between
functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling.
Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as
modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches
towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have
relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy
data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood
is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a
measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by
introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter
distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ
outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a
manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic
PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.

Conclusion: FedProTIP通过梯度投影和任务身份预测有效缓解了联邦持续学习中的遗忘问题，在任务身份未知的场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables distributed client devices to
learn from streaming data across diverse and evolving tasks. A major challenge
to continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, is exacerbated in decentralized
settings by the data heterogeneity, constrained communication and privacy
concerns. We propose Federated gradient Projection-based Continual Learning
with Task Identity Prediction (FedProTIP), a novel FCL framework that mitigates
forgetting by projecting client updates onto the orthogonal complement of the
subspace spanned by previously learned representations of the global model.
This projection reduces interference with earlier tasks and preserves
performance across the task sequence. To further address the challenge of
task-agnostic inference, we incorporate a lightweight mechanism that leverages
core bases from prior tasks to predict task identity and dynamically adjust the
global model's outputs. Extensive experiments across standard FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that FedProTIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in average accuracy, particularly in settings where task identities are a
priori unknown.

Conclusion: 投影抽象为处理信息损失的因果抽象问题提供了新的解决方案，扩展了因果抽象理论的应用范围。

Abstract: The study of causal abstractions bridges two integral components of human
intelligence: the ability to determine cause and effect, and the ability to
interpret complex patterns into abstract concepts. Formally, causal abstraction
frameworks define connections between complicated low-level causal models and
simple high-level ones. One major limitation of most existing definitions is
that they are not well-defined when considering lossy abstraction functions in
which multiple low-level interventions can have different effects while mapping
to the same high-level intervention (an assumption called the abstract
invariance condition). In this paper, we introduce a new type of abstractions
called projected abstractions that generalize existing definitions to
accommodate lossy representations. We show how to construct a projected
abstraction from the low-level model and how it translates equivalent
observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to
high-level. Given that the true model is rarely available in practice we prove
a new graphical criteria for identifying and estimating high-level causal
queries from limited low-level data. Finally, we experimentally show the
effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image
settings.

TL;DR: LANCE提出了一种一次性高阶SVD的低秩激活压缩框架，用于设备端学习和持续学习，显著减少内存使用同时保持准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备端学习需要高效学习，但反向传播中激活存储的内存成本很高。现有压缩方法依赖重复低秩分解，带来计算开销，且未探索持续学习场景。

Method: 使用一次性高阶SVD获得可重用的低秩子空间进行激活投影，避免重复分解。固定低秩子空间通过分配任务到正交子空间实现持续学习。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100等数据集上减少激活存储达250倍，准确率与完整反向传播相当。在持续学习基准测试中，以少量内存成本达到与正交梯度投影方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: LANCE为边缘设备上的高效微调和持续学习提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term
adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires
efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring
new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by
high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing
activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated
low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods
have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank
Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order
Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for
activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both
memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable
on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces
without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE
reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy
comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets,
Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split
CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive
with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost.
These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient
fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型训练资源消耗巨大，观察到大部分学习发生在训练早期阶段，权重变化随后趋于稳定，这些变化可以通过低秩矩阵捕捉。

Method: 使用用户定义的超参数确定切换点，根据每个模块层的收敛程度分配特定秩，动态从全参数训练切换到LoRA训练。

Result: 该方法将可训练参数减少到原来的10%，吞吐量提高3倍，每轮平均训练时间减少1.5倍，GPU内存消耗降低20%，同时保持模型准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的动态切换训练方法能有效减少训练资源消耗，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Training large models ranging from millions to billions of parameters is
highly resource-intensive, requiring significant time, compute, and memory. It
is observed that most of the learning (higher change in weights) takes place in
the earlier stage of the training loop. These changes stabilize as training
continues, enabling them to be captured by matrices of a low intrinsic rank.
Therefore, we propose an approach to identify such states of partial
convergence and dynamically switch from full parameter training to Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on the ViT-Large model. We introduce a flexible approach that
leverages user-defined hyperparameters to determine the switching point and
assign a rank specific to each module layer based on its level of convergence.
Experimental results show that this approach preserves model accuracy while
reducing the number of trainable parameters to 10% of its original size,
resulting in a 3x improvement in throughput, and a 1.5x reduction in average
training time per epoch while also reducing GPU memory consumption by 20%

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子Hessian矩阵在计算化学中至关重要，但计算成本高昂且随系统规模扩展性差，无论是量子力学方法还是神经网络都面临这一问题。

Method: 利用图神经网络消息传递过程中计算得到的不可约表示特征（最高l=2度），构建SE(3)-等变、对称的Hessian矩阵。

Result: HIP Hessians比传统方法快1-2个数量级，更准确，内存效率更高，训练更容易，且具有更好的系统规模扩展性。

Conclusion: HIP方法在过渡态搜索、几何优化加速、零点能校正和振动分析等任务中表现出持续优越性能，为Hessian矩阵的直接预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fundamental tasks in computational chemistry, from transition state search to
vibrational analysis, rely on molecular Hessians, which are the second
derivatives of the potential energy. Yet, Hessians are computationally
expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum
mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that
Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying
on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can
construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible
representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message
passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of
magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and
enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions
across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior
performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization,
zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We
open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of
the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip

TL;DR: 提出了BHRA方法，通过分块Hadamard调制解决LoRA在参数高效微调中的低秩限制问题，在保持参数效率的同时实现局部秩放大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法如LoRA受限于名义秩r，HiRA等扩展方法虽然提高了名义秩但将每个更新与冻结权重矩阵的全局能量模式耦合，ABBA则完全学习稠密中间层。需要解决全局调制的局限性。

Method: 提出BHRA方法，将每个权重矩阵分区，在每个块内独立应用HiRA风格的乘法调制，保持PEFT参数足迹的同时解锁局部秩放大。

Result: 在8个常识推理任务和2个算术基准测试中，使用Llama-3.2 1B/3B、Mistral-7B和Gemma-2 9B模型，BHRA在匹配参数预算下始终优于强PEFT基线。

Conclusion: 块状设计在保持丰富频谱的同时缓解了全局调制引起的崩溃，BHRA在参数高效微调中表现出色。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods must be resource-efficient yet
handle heterogeneous reasoning transformations, and classical low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) is constrained by the nominal rank $r$. Hadamard-style
extensions like HiRA raise the nominal rank but couple every update to the
global energy pattern of the frozen weight matrix, while ABBA trades this
inductive bias for fully learned dense intermediates. To address the limitation
of global modulation, we propose Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA),
which partitions each weight matrix and applies HiRA-style multiplicative
modulation independently within every block, preserving the PEFT parameter
footprint while unlocking localized rank amplification. Our empirical analyses
reveal that this blockwise design maintains rich spectra across rank budgets,
mitigating the collapse induced by global modulation. Across eight commonsense
reasoning tasks and two arithmetic benchmarks with Llama-3.2 1B/3B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma-2 9B, BHRA consistently surpasses strong PEFT baselines under matched
parameter budgets.

Conclusion: 掩码预训练行为可通过线性回归理论直接表征，R²MAE作为一种简单但被忽视的预训练方案，能够有效捕获多尺度特征并在多个领域取得优异表现。

Abstract: Mask-based pretraining has become a cornerstone of modern large-scale models
across language, vision, and recently biology. Despite its empirical success,
its role and limits in learning data representations have been unclear. In this
work, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly
characterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm ("ridge-less")
linear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further
analysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based
pretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated
across diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers)
applied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an
embarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random
Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features
from data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our
linear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA
sequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard
and more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for
state-of-the-art models. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 为人工智能系统中的安全、信任和AGI这些非正式概念提供严格的数学定义，并探索它们之间的理论关系。

Method: 通过数学定义安全（系统从不做出错误声明）、信任（假设系统是安全的）和AGI（AI系统始终匹配或超越人类能力），并采用形式化证明方法。

Result: 证明了一个安全且受信任的AI系统不能是AGI系统：存在某些任务实例，人类可以轻松且可证明地解决，但该系统无法解决。

Conclusion: 安全、信任和AGI在严格数学定义下存在根本性不兼容，这类似于哥德尔不完备性定理和图灵停机问题不可判定性的解释。

Abstract: Safety, trust and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are aspirational
goals in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and there are several informal
interpretations of these notions. In this paper, we propose strict,
mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a
fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the
property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the
system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or
exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal
definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI
system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are
easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we
consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is
possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical
interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification,
planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's
incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting
problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's
results.

Conclusion: DriftLite为扩散模型的推理时适应提供了一条原则性、高效的路径。

Abstract: We study inference-time scaling for diffusion models, where the goal is to
adapt a pre-trained model to new target distributions without retraining.
Existing guidance-based methods are simple but introduce bias, while
particle-based corrections suffer from weight degeneracy and high computational
cost. We introduce DriftLite, a lightweight, training-free particle-based
approach that steers the inference dynamics on the fly with provably optimal
stability control. DriftLite exploits a previously unexplored degree of freedom
in the Fokker-Planck equation between the drift and particle potential, and
yields two practical instantiations: Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance
(VCG/ECG) for approximating the optimal drift with minimal overhead. Across
Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand
co-folding problems, DriftLite consistently reduces variance and improves
sample quality over pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines. These
results highlight a principled, efficient route toward scalable inference-time
adaptation of diffusion models.

Conclusion: 尽管一般离散模型从纯观测数据中不可识别，但可以表征兼容参数和结构的完整集合，为离散数据的结构学习提供了更通用的框架。

Abstract: Existing methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data
typically assume that the data are generated from specific structural equation
models. However, these assumptions may not align with the true data-generating
process, which limits the general applicability of such methods. Furthermore,
current approaches often ignore the complex dependence structure inherent in
discrete data and consider only linear effects. We propose a differentiable
structure learning framework that is capable of capturing arbitrary
dependencies among discrete variables. We show that although general discrete
models are unidentifiable from purely observational data, it is possible to
characterize the complete set of compatible parameters and structures.
Additionally, we establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild
assumptions. We formulate the learning problem as a single differentiable
optimization task in the most general form, thereby avoiding the unrealistic
simplifications adopted by previous methods. Empirical results demonstrate that
our approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-governed inverse problems are fundamental
across various scientific and engineering applications; yet they face
significant challenges due to nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and sensitivity to

integrating physics-driven inversion and data-driven learning. RED-DiffEq
leverages pretrained diffusion models as a regularization mechanism for

inversion problem in geophysics, a challenging seismic imaging technique that
seeks to reconstruct high-resolution subsurface velocity models from seismic
measurement data. Our method shows enhanced accuracy and robustness compared to
conventional methods. Additionally, it exhibits strong generalization ability

Abstract: Treatment effect estimation is essential for informed decision-making in many
fields such as healthcare, economics, and public policy. While flexible machine
learning models have been widely applied for estimating heterogeneous treatment
effects, quantifying the inherent uncertainty of their point predictions
remains an issue. Recent advancements in conformal prediction address this
limitation by allowing for inexpensive computation, as well as distribution
shifts, while still providing frequentist, finite-sample coverage guarantees
under minimal assumptions for any point-predictor model. This advancement holds
significant potential for improving decision-making in especially high-stakes
environments. In this work, we perform a systematic review regarding conformal
prediction methods for treatment effect estimation and provide for both the
necessary theoretical background. Through a systematic filtering process, we
select and analyze eleven key papers, identifying and describing current
state-of-the-art methods in this area. Based on our findings, we propose

Abstract: Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) aims to generate step-by-step
instructions that combine text and images, with the central challenge of
preserving object-state consistency across modalities while producing
informative plans. Existing approaches often leverage large language models
(LLMs) to refine textual steps; however, visual object-state alignment and
systematic evaluation are largely underexplored. We present MMPlanner, a
zero-shot MPP framework that introduces Object State Reasoning Chain-of-Thought
(OSR-CoT) prompting to explicitly model object-state transitions and generate
accurate multimodal plans. To assess plan quality, we design LLM-as-a-judge
protocols for planning accuracy and cross-modal alignment, and further propose
a visual step-reordering task to measure temporal coherence. Experiments on
RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN show that MMPlanner achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving textual planning by +6.8%, cross-modal alignment by
+11.9%, and visual step ordering by +26.7%

*Davide Bizzaro,Alessandro Daniele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Logic of Hypotheses (LoH)语言，统一了神经符号集成中的规则注入和规则学习两种方法，通过可学习的选项运算符实现数据驱动规则学习与符号先验的灵活集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号集成领域存在两种方法：将手工规则注入神经网络模型，以及从数据中归纳符号规则。需要一种统一框架来灵活集成数据驱动的规则学习和符号先验知识。

Method: 扩展命题逻辑语法，引入具有可学习参数的选择运算符，可以从选项池中选择子公式。使用模糊逻辑将LoH公式编译为可微分计算图，通过反向传播学习最优选择。

Result: 在表格数据和Visual Tic-Tac-Toe神经符号任务上表现出强大性能，同时产生可解释的决策规则。使用Goedel模糊逻辑和Goedel技巧可以实现无性能损失的离散化。

Conclusion: LoH框架统一了现有神经符号模型，支持任意程度的知识规范，既能保持高性能又能产生可解释的决策规则。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic integration (NeSy) blends neural-network learning with symbolic
reasoning. The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules
into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data. We introduce
Logic of Hypotheses (LoH), a novel language that unifies these strands,
enabling the flexible integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic
priors and expert knowledge. LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a
choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a
pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled
into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be
learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models,
while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification.
Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick
yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without
any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models,
showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task,
while producing interpretable decision rules.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的正则化方法DIM，通过在深度神经网络中强制执行领域知识驱动的单调性约束来防止过拟合，提高模型泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型由于复杂结构和大量参数容易过拟合，会记忆训练数据中的噪声而非学习可泛化的模式

Method: 通过惩罚相对于线性基线的单调性违反来强制执行单调性，建立数学框架包括线性参考、单调行为偏差测量，并将这些测量整合到训练目标中

Result: 在芝加哥网约车数据集和合成数据集上的实验表明，即使适度的单调性约束也能持续提升各种神经网络架构的性能

Conclusion: DIM通过应用领域知识驱动的单调性约束来正则化模型行为并减轻过拟合，从而提高了深度神经网络的预测性能

Abstract: While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due
to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to
memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that
generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new
regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep
Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships
in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically,
our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear
baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while
preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a
comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference,
measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements
into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology
using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically
created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show
that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model
performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by
applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior
and mitigate overfitting

Motivation: 目前缺乏针对颅内脑电图的标准化评估框架，无法有效比较不同建模方法。高分辨率神经数据集需要严谨的基准来区分竞争性建模方法。

Method: 构建Neuroprobe解码任务套件，基于BrainTreebank数据集，利用iEEG的高时空分辨率，系统测量语言处理特征在不同时间和电极位置的可解码性。

Result: 发现线性基线模型表现惊人地强，在许多任务上超越了前沿的基础模型。通过Neuroprobe可可视化信息从颞上回流向前额叶皮层的过程，以及从简单听觉特征到复杂语言特征的进展。

Conclusion: Neuroprobe为iEEG基础模型提供了严谨的比较框架，促进该领域的快速发展，代码开源并维护公开排行榜。

Abstract: High-resolution neural datasets enable foundation models for the next
generation of brain-computer interfaces and neurological treatments. The
community requires rigorous benchmarks to discriminate between competing
modeling approaches, yet no standardized evaluation frameworks exist for
intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. To address this gap, we present Neuroprobe:
a suite of decoding tasks for studying multi-modal language processing in the
brain. Unlike scalp EEG, intracranial EEG requires invasive surgery to implant
electrodes that record neural activity directly from the brain with minimal
signal distortion. Neuroprobe is built on the BrainTreebank dataset, which
consists of 40 hours of iEEG recordings from 10 human subjects performing a
naturalistic movie viewing task. Neuroprobe serves two critical functions.
First, it is a mine from which neuroscience insights can be drawn. Its high
temporal and spatial resolution allows researchers to systematically determine
when and where computations for each aspect of language processing occur in the
brain by measuring the decodability of each feature across time and all
electrode locations. Using Neuroprobe, we visualize how information flows from
the superior temporal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex, and the progression from
simple auditory features to more complex language features in a purely
data-driven manner. Second, as the field moves toward neural foundation models,
Neuroprobe provides a rigorous framework for comparing competing architectures
and training protocols. We found that the linear baseline is surprisingly
strong, beating frontier foundation models on many tasks. Neuroprobe is
designed with computational efficiency and ease of use in mind. We make the
code for Neuroprobe openly available and maintain a public leaderboard, aiming
to enable rapid progress in the field of iEEG foundation models, at
https://neuroprobe.dev/

TL;DR: SlotFM是一个用于加速度计数据的通用基础模型，通过时频槽注意力机制生成多个小嵌入来捕捉信号的不同组件，在16个分类和回归下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型主要关注日常活动分类，限制了其在更广泛任务中的应用，需要开发能泛化到多样化下游任务的加速度计基础模型。

Method: 使用时频槽注意力机制处理原始信号的时频表示，生成多个小嵌入捕获不同信号组件，并引入两个损失正则化器来捕捉局部结构和频率模式。

Result: 在16个分类和回归下游任务中，SlotFM在13个任务上优于现有自监督方法，其余任务与最佳方法表现相当，平均性能提升4.5%。

Conclusion: SlotFM展示了感知基础模型的强大泛化能力，能够有效处理超出标准人类活动识别的多样化任务。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as
gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing
foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such
as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range
of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an
accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream
tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot
Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw
signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing
different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most
relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that
capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of
fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant
information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream
tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms
existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves
comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On
average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong
generalization for sensing foundation models.

Motivation: K-means聚类是一个困难的离散优化问题，现有松弛算法在平衡约束可行性和目标最优性方面存在困难，难以计算具有严格保证的二阶临界点。

Method: 将K-means问题重新表述为子流形上的光滑无约束优化，利用黎曼几何结构，通过二阶立方正则化黎曼牛顿算法求解，并将K-means流形分解为乘积流形以线性时间解决每个牛顿子问题。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法比最先进的一阶非负低秩分解方法收敛速度显著更快，同时达到相似的统计精度。

Conclusion: 通过黎曼优化框架成功解决了K-means聚类的离散优化挑战，提供了高效且具有严格理论保证的二阶算法。

Abstract: Clustering is a hard discrete optimization problem. Nonconvex approaches such
as low-rank semidefinite programming (SDP) have recently demonstrated promising
statistical and local algorithmic guarantees for cluster recovery. Due to the
combinatorial structure of the $K$-means clustering problem, current relaxation
algorithms struggle to balance their constraint feasibility and objective
optimality, presenting tremendous challenges in computing the second-order
critical points with rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we provide a new
formulation of the $K$-means problem as a smooth unconstrained optimization
over a submanifold and characterize its Riemannian structures to allow it to be
solved using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. By
factorizing the $K$-means manifold into a product manifold, we show how each
Newton subproblem can be solved in linear time. Our numerical experiments show
that the proposed method converges significantly faster than the
state-of-the-art first-order nonnegative low-rank factorization method, while
achieving similarly optimal statistical accuracy.

Motivation: 自回归模型在蛋白质工程中面临推理延迟高的问题，而现有的推测解码方法由于忽略蛋白质的结构和功能约束，导致生成序列生物学不合理且似然分布偏移。

Method: 引入SpecMER框架，利用从多序列比对中提取的k-mer基序作为生物、结构和功能先验，并行评分候选序列并选择最符合已知生物学模式的序列。

Result: SpecMER相比标准自回归解码实现了24-32%的加速，同时具有更高的接受率和改进的序列似然。

Conclusion: SpecMER成功地将生物先验整合到推测解码中，在保持效率的同时显著提高了生成蛋白质序列的生物学合理性。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have transformed protein engineering by enabling the
generation of novel protein sequences beyond those found in nature. However,
their sequential inference introduces significant latency, limiting their
utility in high-throughput protein screening. Speculative decoding accelerates
generation by employing a lightweight draft model to sample tokens, which a
larger target model then verifies and refines. Yet, in protein sequence
generation, draft models are typically agnostic to the structural and
functional constraints of the target protein, leading to biologically
implausible outputs and a shift in the likelihood distribution of generated
sequences. We introduce SpecMER (Speculative Decoding via k-mer Guidance), a
novel framework that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors
using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. By scoring
candidate sequences in parallel and selecting those most consistent with known
biological patterns, SpecMER significantly improves sequence plausibility while
retaining the efficiency of speculative decoding. SpecMER achieves 24-32%
speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance
rates and improved sequence likelihoods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种正交改进方法，通过使用最小辅助信息来提升仅基于PPG的心脏骤停预测系统性能，包括时间到事件建模、对抗性去身份特征学习和伪标签回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于PPG的生理基础模型在预测心脏骤停等关键事件方面表现出色，但其强大表示能力在下游数据/标签稀缺时未能充分利用。需要开发更有效的CA预测系统。

Method: 1) 时间到事件建模：通过简单回归事件发生时间或精细离散生存建模；2) 对抗性去身份特征学习：训练大规模去身份生物识别模型，对抗性地去除可能导致过拟合的身份线索；3) 伪标签回归：使用预训练辅助网络生成伪连续估计作为目标。

Result: 提出的方法独立将24小时时间平均AUC从0.74提升到0.78-0.80范围，在较长时域内显著改善，事件附近性能下降最小，推动了早期预警系统研究。

Conclusion: 通过多任务公式和PCGrad优化技术缓解竞争损失间的高梯度冲突，三种正交改进方法有效提升了PPG-only心脏骤停预测系统的性能。

Abstract: High-frequency physiological waveform modality offers deep, real-time
insights into patient status. Recently, physiological foundation models based
on Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict
critical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA). However, their powerful
representation still needs to be leveraged suitably, especially when the
downstream data/label is scarce. We offer three orthogonal improvements to
improve PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we
propose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the
event onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling.
Second, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them
patient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the
largest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the
p-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as
person identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we
propose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary
estimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as
lactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via
zero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform
labels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets. Our proposals can
independently improve the 24-hour time-averaged AUC from the 0.74 to the
0.78-0.80 range. We primarily improve over longer time horizons with minimal
degradation near the event, thus pushing the Early Warning System research.
Finally, we pursue multi-task formulation and diagnose it with a high gradient
conflict rate among competing losses, which we alleviate via the PCGrad
optimization technique.

Conclusion: EIN通过子图枚举、神经网络和稀疏正则化的结合，在保持高判别能力的同时实现了可解释性，并通过剪枝策略缓解了计算困难。

Abstract: In the graph-level prediction task (predict a label for a given graph), the
information contained in subgraphs of the input graph plays a key role. In this
paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the
exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In
general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative
ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our
combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high
discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph.
Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective
pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration
while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important
subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that
EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph
neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on
the selected subgraphs.

Abstract: Understanding urban human mobility patterns at various spatial levels is
essential for social science. This study presents a machine learning framework
to downscale origin-destination (OD) taxi trips flows in New York City from a
larger spatial unit to a smaller spatial unit. First, correlations between OD
trips and demographic, socioeconomic, and commuting characteristics are
developed using four models: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN). Second, a
perturbation-based sensitivity analysis is applied to interpret variable
importance for nonlinear models. The results show that the linear regression
model failed to capture the complex variable interactions. While NN performs
best with the training and testing datasets, SVM shows the best generalization
ability in downscaling performance. The methodology presented in this study
provides both analytical advancement and practical applications to improve
transportation services and urban development.

Conclusion: PQFed在个性化联邦学习设置中展现出良好的可扩展性和有效性。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training without sharing raw
data, but data heterogeneity consistently challenges the performance of the
global model. Traditional optimization methods often rely on collaborative
global model training involving all clients, followed by local adaptation to
improve individual performance. In this work, we focus on early-stage quality
control and propose PQFed, a novel privacy-preserving personalized federated
learning framework that designs customized training strategies for each client
prior to the federated training process. PQFed extracts representative features
from each client's raw data and applies clustering techniques to estimate
inter-client dataset similarity. Based on these similarity estimates, the
framework implements a client selection strategy that enables each client to
collaborate with others who have compatible data distributions. We evaluate
PQFed on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and MNIST, integrated with three
existing federated learning algorithms. Experimental results show that PQFed
consistently improves the target client's model performance, even with a
limited number of participants. We further benchmark PQFed against a baseline
cluster-based algorithm, IFCA, and observe that PQFed also achieves better
performance in low-participation scenarios. These findings highlight PQFed's
scalability and effectiveness in personalized federated learning settings.

Abstract: Harnessing parallelism in seemingly sequential models is a central challenge
for modern machine learning. Several approaches have been proposed for
evaluating sequential processes in parallel using fixed-point methods, like
Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations. In this work, we show that these methods
can be understood within a common framework based on linear dynamical systems
(LDSs), where different iteration schemes arise naturally as approximate
linearizations of a nonlinear recursion. This unifying view highlights shared
principles behind these techniques and clarifies when particular fixed-point
methods are most likely to be effective. By bridging diverse algorithms through
the language of LDSs, our framework provides a clearer theoretical foundation
for parallelizing sequential models and points toward new opportunities for
efficient and scalable computation.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实证验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的信息论方法能够有效处理双层贝叶斯优化问题，通过统一标准同时优化两个层级的目标。

Abstract: A bilevel optimization problem consists of two optimization problems nested
as an upper- and a lower-level problem, in which the optimality of the
lower-level problem defines a constraint for the upper-level problem. This
paper considers Bayesian optimization (BO) for the case that both the upper-
and lower-levels involve expensive black-box functions. Because of its nested
structure, bilevel optimization has a complex problem definition and, compared
with other standard extensions of BO such as multi-objective or constraint
settings, it has not been widely studied. We propose an information-theoretic
approach that considers the information gain of both the upper- and
lower-optimal solutions and values. This enables us to define a unified
criterion that measures the benefit for both level problems, simultaneously.
Further, we also show a practical lower bound based approach to evaluating the
information gain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method through several benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease
(AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains
challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal
characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by
existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable
spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD
progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model
the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the
Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse
regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification
of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression.
Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal
lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral
attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities
correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover,
our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural
systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight
the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized
prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled
longitudinal imaging data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法在样本效率方面表现不佳，而现有LLM方法未能充分利用上下文学习能力，将每个优化步骤独立处理。

Method: 提出POLO框架，核心是偏好引导策略优化(PGPO)算法，通过轨迹级优化和轮次级偏好学习的双层次学习机制。

Result: 在单属性任务上达到84%的平均成功率（比基线好2.3倍），多属性任务上达到50%成功率，仅需500次oracle评估。

Conclusion: POLO通过充分利用每次昂贵的oracle调用来实现卓越的样本效率，显著推进了样本高效分子优化的技术水平。

Abstract: Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast
chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while
preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent
advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample
efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle
evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through
their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align
naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods
fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently.
To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for
Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization
trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces
Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning
algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels:
trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while
turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking
intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning
from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully
exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO
achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than
baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations,
significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular
optimization.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级BrainPoG模型，通过病理模式过滤和病理特征蒸馏实现高效脑图学习，在多种脑疾病检测任务中表现优异且计算效率高


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑图学习方法难以选择性学习疾病相关知识，导致参数和计算成本过高，限制了在真实临床场景中的实用性

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，BrainPoG在模型性能和计算效率方面均表现出优越性

Conclusion: BrainPoG能够专门学习信息丰富的疾病相关知识，避免不相关信息，实现高效的脑图学习

Abstract: Brain graph learning has demonstrated significant achievements in the fields
of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods struggle
to selectively learn disease-related knowledge, leading to heavy parameters and
computational costs. This challenge diminishes their efficiency, as well as
limits their practicality for real-world clinical applications. To this end, we
propose a lightweight Brain PathoGraph Learning (BrainPoG) model that enables
efficient brain graph learning by pathological pattern filtering and
pathological feature distillation. Specifically, BrainPoG first contains a
filter to extract the pathological pattern formulated by highly
disease-relevant subgraphs, achieving graph pruning and lesion localization. A
PathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs
from the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation
module is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance
pathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively
learn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant
information, achieving efficient brain graph learning. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate that BrainPoG exhibits superiority in both
model performance and computational efficiency across various brain disease
detection tasks.

TL;DR: HyperCore是一个针对噪声环境的鲁棒自适应核心集选择框架，利用轻量级超球面模型和Youden's J统计量自动选择剪枝阈值，无需超参数调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心集选择方法通常忽略标注错误并需要固定剪枝比例，在实际应用中不实用。

Method: 使用每类轻量级超球面模型，将类内样本嵌入到超球面中心附近，基于距离自然分离类外样本，通过Youden's J统计量自适应选择剪枝阈值。

Result: 在噪声和低数据情况下，HyperCore始终优于最先进的核心集选择方法，有效丢弃错误标注和模糊点。

Conclusion: HyperCore产生紧凑且信息丰富的子集，适用于可扩展和无噪声学习。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection methods is to identify representative subsets
of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing methods often ignore
the possibility of annotation errors and require fixed pruning ratios, making
them impractical in real-world settings. We present HyperCore, a robust and
adaptive coreset selection framework designed explicitly for noisy
environments. HyperCore leverages lightweight hypersphere models learned per
class, embedding in-class samples close to a hypersphere center while naturally
segregating out-of-class samples based on their distance. By using Youden's J
statistic, HyperCore can adaptively select pruning thresholds, enabling
automatic, noise-aware data pruning without hyperparameter tuning. Our
experiments reveal that HyperCore consistently surpasses state-of-the-art
coreset selection methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes.
HyperCore effectively discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding
compact yet highly informative subsets suitable for scalable and noise-free
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心集选择方法需要在整个数据集上计算昂贵的训练信号（如梯度、决策边界估计），这与避免训练样本的初衷相矛盾。

Method: 提出SubZeroCore方法，将子模覆盖和密度整合到统一目标中，基于闭式解的最优平衡采样策略，通过单一超参数控制局部密度测量的期望覆盖。

Result: 无需训练即可匹配基于训练的基线方法，在高剪枝率下显著优于它们，计算开销大幅减少，对标签噪声具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SubZeroCore展示了实际有效性和可扩展性，为现实场景提供了高效的核心集选择解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection is to identify representative subsets of
datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing approaches paradoxically
require expensive training-based signals, e.g., gradients, decision boundary
estimates or forgetting counts, computed over the entire dataset prior to
pruning, which undermines their very purpose by requiring training on samples
they aim to avoid. We introduce SubZeroCore, a novel, training-free coreset
selection method that integrates submodular coverage and density into a single,
unified objective. To achieve this, we introduce a sampling strategy based on a
closed-form solution to optimally balance these objectives, guided by a single
hyperparameter that explicitly controls the desired coverage for local density
measures. Despite no training, extensive evaluations show that SubZeroCore
matches training-based baselines and significantly outperforms them at high
pruning rates, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. SubZeroCore
also demonstrates superior robustness to label noise, highlighting its
practical effectiveness and scalability for real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出基于神经场的4DVAR重构方法，将时空状态表示为神经网络参数化的连续函数，实现并行优化并降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统4DVAR成本函数优化困难且计算量大，需要更高效的数据同化方法

Method: 使用神经网络参数化时空状态，通过物理约束损失函数直接融入物理规律，实现并行时间优化

Result: 在二维不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程上测试，相比基线4DVAR产生更稳定的初始条件估计，无伪振荡

Conclusion: 该方法无需真实状态或再分析数据，在参考信息有限的情况下具有更广泛适用性

Abstract: Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) is a cornerstone of
numerical weather prediction, but its cost function is difficult to optimize
and computationally intensive. We propose a neural field-based reformulation in
which the full spatiotemporal state is represented as a continuous function
parameterized by a neural network. This reparameterization removes the
time-sequential dependency of classical 4DVAR, enabling parallel-in-time
optimization in parameter space. Physical constraints are incorporated directly
through a physics-informed loss, simplifying implementation and reducing
computational cost. We evaluate the method on the two-dimensional
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with Kolmogorov forcing. Compared to a
baseline 4DVAR implementation, the neural reparameterized variants produce more
stable initial condition estimates without spurious oscillations. Notably,
unlike most machine learning-based approaches, our framework does not require
access to ground-truth states or reanalysis data, broadening its applicability
to settings with limited reference information.

Motivation: 多发性硬化症患者常报告手部灵巧性和认知疲劳问题，但损伤往往细微难以检测。研究旨在发现解释认知疲劳的脑活动生物标志物，为未来脑刺激治疗提供靶点。

Method: 招募15名无手部、活动或认知障碍的MS患者和12名匹配对照，完成单任务和双任务手部灵巧测试，使用fNIRS测量双侧前额叶和感觉运动皮层活动，应用机器学习分类和可解释AI分析。

Result: KNN分类器在单任务和双任务中分别达到75.0%和66.7%的准确率。MS组在对侧半球的缘上回/角回和中央前回区域活动抑制且神经血管反应较慢，脱氧血红蛋白比常规氧合血红蛋白是更好的预测指标。

Conclusion: 这种非传统的fNIRS数据分析方法揭示了新的脑活动生物标志物，有助于开发个性化的脑刺激靶点。

Abstract: People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) complain of problems with hand dexterity
and cognitive fatigue. However, in many cases, impairments are subtle and
difficult to detect. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a
non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain hemodynamic responses
during cognitive or motor tasks. We aimed to detect brain activity biomarkers
that could explain subjective reports of cognitive fatigue while completing
dexterous tasks and provide targets for future brain stimulation treatments. We
recruited 15 people with MS who did not have a hand (Nine Hole Peg Test
[NHPT]), mobility, or cognitive impairment, and 12 age- and sex-matched
controls. Participants completed two types of hand dexterity tasks with their
dominant hand, single task and dual task (NHPT while holding a ball between the
fifth finger and hypothenar eminence of the same hand). We analyzed fNIRS data
(oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels) using a machine learning
framework to classify MS patients from controls based on their brain activation
patterns in bilateral prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. The K-Nearest
Neighbor classifier achieved an accuracy of 75.0% for single manual dexterity
tasks and 66.7% for the more complex dual manual dexterity tasks. Using XAI, we
found that the most important brain regions contributing to the machine
learning model were the supramarginal/angular gyri and the precentral gyrus
(sensory integration and motor regions) of the ipsilateral hemisphere, with
suppressed activity and slower neurovascular response in the MS group. During
both tasks, deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than the
conventional measure of oxygenated hemoglobin. This nonconventional method of
fNIRS data analysis revealed novel brain activity biomarkers that can help
develop personalized brain stimulation targets.

TL;DR: 提出有效信息准则(EIC)来衡量符号回归公式的结构合理性，通过检测数值不稳定性和舍入噪声放大来识别不合理结构，提升公式可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法仅使用复杂度指标作为可解释性代理，忽略了公式内部数学结构。物理公式通常具有数值稳定性，这启发了EIC的提出。

Method: 将公式视为具有特定内部结构的信息处理系统，通过检测有效数字损失或舍入噪声放大来识别不合理结构。将EIC与搜索式和生成式符号回归算法结合。

Result: 结合EIC改善了Pareto前沿性能，减少了结果中的不合理结构。与生成式算法结合使预训练样本需求减少2-4倍。EIC与108位人类专家对公式可解释性偏好的吻合度达70.2%。

Conclusion: EIC通过衡量公式中的不合理结构，实际反映了公式的可解释性，为符号回归提供了更好的结构合理性评估标准。

Abstract: Symbolic regression discovers accurate and interpretable formulas to describe
given data, thereby providing scientific insights for domain experts and
promoting scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods
often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only
considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical
structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the
discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or
interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that
physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation
precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats
formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures
and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant
digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system.
We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality
of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world
physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression
algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the
irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based
algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving
sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar
accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts'
preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring
the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's
interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种并发感知的推测解码框架，通过动态调整草稿和验证策略来加速GRPO训练过程，并引入在线草稿学习机制来解决分布漂移问题，实现了2.35-2.72倍的端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在提升大语言模型推理能力方面表现出色，但其训练过程过于缓慢，主要瓶颈在于每个查询需要自回归生成多个响应。虽然推测解码提供了加速方向，但在高并发训练条件下直接应用效果有限。

Method: 1) 并发感知推测解码框架：根据实时并发水平动态调整草稿和验证策略；2) 在线草稿学习机制：使用目标模型的反馈信号让草稿模型持续适应，解决分布漂移问题。

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集和模型上的实验结果表明，该方法实现了2.35倍到2.72倍的端到端加速，显著超越了基线方法的效率。

Conclusion: 提出的并发感知推测解码框架和在线草稿学习机制有效解决了GRPO训练中的性能瓶颈，显著提升了训练效率，为大规模语言模型的高效训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated significant
potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) via reinforcement learning. However, its practical deployment is impeded
by an excessively slow training process, primarily attributed to the
computationally intensive autoregressive generation of multiple responses per
query, which makes the generation phase the primary performance bottleneck.
Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration,
its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency
training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the
drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels,
thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process. Furthermore, to
address performance degradation arising from distributional drift between the
evolving target model and the fixed draft model during training, we introduce
an online draft learning mechanism that enables the draft model to continuously
adapt using feedback signals from the target model. Experimental results across
multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves end-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x, significantly
surpassing baseline approaches in efficiency. The code is available at

Abstract: Fatigue detection using physiological signals is critical in domains such as

combinations and evaluated them with Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, and XGBoost. Results show that XGBoost with the EMG EEG combination
achieved the best performance. SHAP analysis highlighted ECG EOG correlation as
a key feature, and multi signal models consistently outperformed single signal

Conclusion: 科学基础模型的泛化能力源于训练系统的多样性而非数据量，为科学基础模型提供了指导原则。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather
prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The
inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a
scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling
approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system,
they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications,
which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited
scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a
foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics.
ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented
with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and
system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a
large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it
improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40%
compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world
applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global
weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error
below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning.
Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding
principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems
from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.

Result: 发现了损失函数与超参数之间的幂律关系：L = α·N^(-β)，其中α和β是常数，N是相关超参数。还开发了命令行参数来改变训练设置。

Conclusion: 建立了材料特性预测神经网络的缩放规律，未来可以进一步研究其他神经网络模型（如GemNet和全连接网络）的缩放规律进行比较。

Abstract: Predicting material properties is crucial for designing better batteries,
semiconductors, and medical devices. Deep learning helps scientists quickly
find promising materials by predicting their energy, forces, and stresses.
Companies scale capacities of deep learning models in multiple domains, such as
language modeling, and invest many millions of dollars into such models. Our
team analyzes how scaling training data (giving models more information to
learn from), model sizes (giving models more capacity to learn patterns), and
compute (giving models more computational resources) for neural networks
affects their performance for material property prediction. In particular, we
trained both transformer and EquiformerV2 neural networks to predict material
properties. We find empirical scaling laws for these models: we can predict how
increasing each of the three hyperparameters (training data, model size, and
compute) affects predictive performance. In particular, the loss $L$ can be
measured with a power law relationship $L = \alpha \cdot N^{-\beta}$, where
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants while $N$ is the relevant hyperparameter. We
also incorporate command-line arguments for changing training settings such as
the amount of epochs, maximum learning rate, and whether mixed precision is
enabled. Future work could entail further investigating scaling laws for other
neural network models in this domain, such as GemNet and fully connected
networks, to assess how they compare to the models we trained.

Motivation: 虽然SAM方法被广泛用于寻找更平坦的极小值点以获得更好的泛化性能，但作者发现该方法可能收敛到不正确的极小值点。

Method: 通过理论证明幻觉极小值点的存在性，建立局部收敛条件，并通过实证研究验证SAM确实会收敛到这些点。

Result: 研究证实了SAM方法存在收敛到幻觉极小值点的问题，这些点不是原始目标的真正极小值。

Conclusion: 作者提出了一个简单而有效的补救措施来避免SAM收敛到幻觉极小值点。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a widely used method that steers
training toward flatter minimizers, which typically generalize better. In this
work, however, we show that SAM can converge to hallucinated minimizers --
points that are not minimizers of the original objective. We theoretically
prove the existence of such hallucinated minimizers and establish conditions
for local convergence to them. We further provide empirical evidence
demonstrating that SAM can indeed converge to these points in practice.
Finally, we propose a simple yet effective remedy for avoiding hallucinated
minimizers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在稀疏奖励环境中，标准MARL算法由于缺乏中间奖励反馈而难以有效指导策略学习，需要新的方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: 构建基于偏好的价值分解网络，生成全局和局部奖励信号，并利用这些信号构建双重优势流，为集中式评论家和分散式执行器提供差异化学习目标。同时利用大语言模型提供偏好标签来提升奖励模型质量。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了在线MARL中的稀疏奖励挑战，证明了所提框架的实用性和有效性。

Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in
environments with sparse rewards, where reward feedback is not provided at each
interaction but only revealed at the end of a trajectory. This setting, though
realistic, presents a fundamental challenge: the lack of intermediate rewards
hinders standard MARL algorithms from effectively guiding policy learning. To
address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse
preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified
architecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent
reward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition
network, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are
further used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated
learning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In
addition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to
provide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model.
Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and
SMACv2, show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing sparse-reward
challenges in online MARL.

Motivation: 现有分析主要关注均匀离散扩散，对掩码扩散的理论理解不足，特别是在高维设置下的复杂度和实际优势缺乏严格分析。

Method: 使用Euler采样器实现ε精度分析，并提出Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU)方法，利用每个token最多被解掩码一次的特性。

Result: Euler采样器达到ε精度需要Õ(d²ε⁻³/²)次离散分数评估，MATU方法实现了O(d ln d·(1-ε²))的复杂度，消除了ln(1/ε)因子。

Conclusion: 研究为掩码离散扩散提供了严格理论基础，展示了其在文本生成中相对于均匀扩散的实际优势，为基于掩码范式的扩散语言模型分析铺平了道路。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion -- a flexible paradigm for text generation
in which tokens are progressively corrupted by special mask symbols before
being denoised. Although this approach has demonstrated strong empirical
performance, its theoretical complexity in high-dimensional settings remains
insufficiently understood. Existing analyses largely focus on uniform discrete
diffusion, and more recent attempts addressing masked diffusion either (1)
overlook widely used Euler samplers, (2) impose restrictive bounded-score
assumptions, or (3) fail to showcase the advantages of masked discrete
diffusion over its uniform counterpart. To address this gap, we show that Euler
samplers can achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy in total variation (TV) with
$\tilde{O}(d^{2}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ discrete score evaluations, thereby providing
the first rigorous analysis of typical Euler sampler in masked discrete
diffusion. We then propose a Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU)
approach that both removes bounded-score assumptions and preserves unbiased
discrete score approximation. By exploiting the property that each token can be
unmasked at most once, MATU attains a nearly $\epsilon$-free complexity of
$O(d\,\ln d\cdot (1-\epsilon^2))$. This result surpasses existing
uniformization methods under uniform discrete diffusion, eliminating the
$\ln(1/\epsilon)$ factor and substantially speeding up convergence. Our
findings not only provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for masked discrete
diffusion, showcasing its practical advantages over uniform diffusion for text
generation, but also pave the way for future efforts to analyze diffusion-based

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个分析草图双线性形式的通用框架，基于相关集合的几何复杂度推导统一边界，并扩展到多独立草图矩阵求和的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代分析中涉及草图双线性形式，但现有统一边界要么不适用，要么在一般集合上不够锐利，需要开发更通用的分析框架。

Method: 采用通用链式方法和处理集合对极值的新技术，分析草图双线性形式，并扩展到T个独立草图矩阵求和的情况。

Result: 推导出基于几何复杂度的统一边界，偏差尺度为√T，恢复Johnson-Lindenstrauss引理等已知结果，扩展RIP型保证，改进联邦学习和多臂老虎机算法的收敛边界。

Conclusion: 该框架为草图双线性形式提供了统一分析工具，在机器学习和随机算法中具有广泛应用，能获得比现有方法更锐利的边界。

Abstract: Uniform bounds on sketched inner products of vectors or matrices underpin
several important computational and statistical results in machine learning and
randomized algorithms, including the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) lemma, the
Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), randomized sketching, and approximate
linear algebra. However, many modern analyses involve *sketched bilinear
forms*, for which existing uniform bounds either do not apply or are not sharp
on general sets. In this work, we develop a general framework to analyze such
sketched bilinear forms and derive uniform bounds in terms of geometric
complexities of the associated sets. Our approach relies on generic chaining
and introduces new techniques for handling suprema over pairs of sets. We
further extend these results to the setting where the bilinear form involves a
sum of $T$ independent sketching matrices and show that the deviation scales as
$\sqrt{T}$. This unified analysis recovers known results such as the J-L lemma
as special cases, while extending RIP-type guarantees. Additionally, we obtain
improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning algorithms where
such cross terms arise naturally due to sketched gradient compression, and
design sketched variants of bandit algorithms with sharper regret bounds that
depend on the geometric complexity of the action and parameter sets, rather
than the ambient dimension.

TL;DR: 提出Graph of Agents (GoA)框架，将长上下文建模问题形式化为压缩问题，通过动态构建输入依赖的协作结构来最大化信息理论压缩目标，显著提升多智能体系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统作为模型无关的长上下文建模方法，无需重新训练或架构修改即可处理超出LLM上下文窗口的输入，但其性能严重依赖手工设计的协作策略和提示工程，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出Graph of Agents (GoA)框架，将长上下文建模问题形式化为压缩问题，建立信息理论压缩目标，并动态构建输入依赖的协作结构来最大化该目标。

Result: 在六个文档问答基准测试中，GoA将检索增强生成的平均F1分数提高了5.7%，比使用固定协作结构的强多智能体基线提高了16.35%。即使只有2K上下文窗口，GoA在LongBench上仍超越了128K上下文窗口的Llama 3.1 8B。

Conclusion: GoA框架通过信息理论方法显著提高了多智能体系统的长上下文建模能力，有效扩展了模型的上下文处理长度，展示了在有限上下文窗口下处理长文档的潜力。

Abstract: As a model-agnostic approach to long context modeling, multi-agent systems
can process inputs longer than a large language model's context window without
retraining or architectural modifications. However, their performance often
heavily relies on hand-crafted multi-agent collaboration strategies and prompt
engineering, which limit generalizability. In this work, we introduce a
principled framework that formalizes the model-agnostic long context modeling
problem as a compression problem, yielding an information-theoretic compression
objective. Building on this framework, we propose Graph of Agents (GoA), which
dynamically constructs an input-dependent collaboration structure that
maximizes this objective. For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document
question answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of
retrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using
a fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K
context window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on
LongBench, showing a dramatic increase in effective context length. Our source

TL;DR: MolSpectLLM是一个基于Qwen2.5-7B预训练的分子基础模型，将实验光谱与分子3D结构统一建模，在光谱相关任务和分子结构生成方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子基础模型主要依赖SMILES表示，忽略了实验光谱和3D结构信息，而这些在真实场景中对于捕捉分子行为至关重要，特别是在立体化学、空间构型和实验验证相关的任务中。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-7B预训练，通过显式建模分子光谱，将实验光谱与分子3D结构统一起来。

Result: 在光谱相关任务上平均准确率达到0.53（NMR、IR、MS基准测试）；在光谱分析任务中，光谱到SMILES的序列准确率为15.5%，标记准确率为41.7%，显著优于大型通用LLM；能够从SMILES或光谱输入直接生成准确的3D分子结构。

Conclusion: MolSpectLLM不仅能在分子解析任务中表现优异，还能连接光谱分析、分子解析和分子设计，为分子基础模型提供了更全面的能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive
performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with
promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction.
Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES
representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural
information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in
real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks
where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are
critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular
foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental
spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular
spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related
tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks.
MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task,
obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on
Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More
importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular
elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly
from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular
elucidation, and molecular design.

TL;DR: 提出了LDAR（学习分心感知检索），一种自适应检索器，通过学习检索能减少干扰段落影响的上文，在减少token使用的同时显著优于长上下文方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM上下文窗口增大至128K tokens以上，直接提供完整文档上下文成为RAG的替代方案，但这种方法存在token效率低、加剧'中间迷失'现象、在有限模型容量下放大干扰等问题。

Method: LDAR是一种自适应检索器，通过学习检索能减轻干扰段落干扰的上文，平衡信息覆盖与干扰之间的权衡。

Result: 在多种LLM架构和六个知识密集型基准测试上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LDAR方法在减少token使用的同时实现了显著更高的性能，突显了平衡信息覆盖与干扰之间权衡的重要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large
Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent
advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K
tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document
context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset
of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable
limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially
redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon;
and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately
degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning
Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve
contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages,
thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage
compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM
architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of
balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单独使用ILP需要指定背景知识且计算成本高，或单独使用MLLMs存在感知幻觉的问题，利用MLLMs即使在幻觉下也能提出结构正确规则的特点。

Method: 基于MLLMs提出的规则结构自动构建ILP任务并修剪搜索空间，然后使用ILP系统基于修正的逻辑事实和形式归纳推理输出规则。

Result: 在具有挑战性的逻辑归纳基准测试中验证了有效性，并展示了在文本到图像定制生成中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: ILP-CoT成功融合了ILP和MLLMs的优势，为从少量非结构化输入中归纳逻辑规则提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose ILP-CoT, a method that bridges Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for abductive logical rule
induction. The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing
logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs,
which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the
requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or
MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key
observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under
hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search
spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP
system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive
reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction
benchmarks, as well as a potential application of our approach, namely
text-to-image customized generation with rule induction. Our code and data are
released at https://github.com/future-item/ILP-CoT.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Zubov-Net自适应稳定学习框架，通过将Zubov方程重新表述为吸引区域与预设吸引区域之间的一致性表征，解决了神经ODE中鲁棒性与准确性的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经ODE由于其动力学系统特性在输入扰动下具有内在鲁棒性，但现有方法往往需要施加Lyapunov稳定性条件来提供形式化鲁棒性保证，这导致了鲁棒性与准确性之间的紧张关系。

Method: 提出Zubov-Net框架，通过三方损失（一致性、分类和分离损失）和并行边界采样算法共同优化神经ODE和Lyapunov函数。设计了基于输入注意力的凸神经网络，通过softmax注意力机制聚焦于平衡点相关特征。

Result: 实验表明，Zubov-Net在保持高分类准确性的同时，显著提高了对各种随机噪声和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Zubov-Net通过主动控制吸引区域几何形状，成功调和了神经ODE的准确性与鲁棒性，为稳定学习提供了新的范式。

Abstract: Despite neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) exhibiting
intrinsic robustness under input perturbations due to their dynamical systems
nature, recent approaches often involve imposing Lyapunov-based stability
conditions to provide formal robustness guarantees. However, a fundamental
challenge remains: the tension between robustness and accuracy, primarily
stemming from the difficulty in imposing appropriate stability conditions. To
address this, we propose an adaptive stable learning framework named Zubov-Net,
which innovatively reformulates Zubov's equation into a consistency
characterization between regions of attraction (RoAs) and prescribed RoAs
(PRoAs). Building on this consistency, we introduce a new paradigm for actively
controlling the geometry of RoAs by directly optimizing PRoAs to reconcile
accuracy and robustness. Our approach is realized through tripartite losses
(consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary
sampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function.
To enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an
input-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism
that focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight
normalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures.
Theoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees
consistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping
PRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter
probability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex
design in Lyapunov functions. Experimentally, Zubov-Net maintains high
classification accuracy while significantly improving robustness against
various stochastic noises and adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 验证RLVR方法在实际应用中的真实效果，解决现有评估中存在的夸大增益问题，提供更可靠的性能测量方法。

Method: 使用部分提示污染审计和匹配预算复现，在清洁、对等控制评估下重新评估RLVR效果；提出税感知训练评估协议，共同优化准确性、基础性和校准弃权。

Result: 在清洁评估下，多个头条性能差距缩小或消失；税感知协议提供了更可靠的推理增益估计，在某些情况下修正了先前结论。

Conclusion: RLVR具有实际价值且已可用于工业应用，但需要保持其实用优势的同时优先考虑可靠性、安全性和测量准确性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a practical and
scalable approach to enhancing large language models in areas such as math,
code, and other structured tasks. Two questions motivate this paper: how much
of the reported gains survive under strictly parity-controlled evaluation, and
whether RLVR is cost-free or exacts a measurable tax. We argue that progress is
real, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax,
evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt
contamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models,
we show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean,
parity-controlled evaluation. We then propose a tax-aware training and
evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated
abstention and standardizes budgeting and provenance checks. Applied to recent
RLVR setups, this protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains
and, in several cases, revises prior conclusions. Our position is constructive:
RLVR is valuable and industry-ready; we advocate keeping its practical benefits
while prioritizing reliability, safety, and measurement.

Result: 推导出适用于更广泛模型类型的Rademacher复杂度边界，解释了高秩权重矩阵模型泛化良好的现象

Conclusion: 该工作为基于Koopman理论的Rademacher复杂度边界在更实际场景中的应用铺平了道路

Abstract: We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using
Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight
matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to
describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types
of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a
kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of
realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for
Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.

<details>

Motivation: 发现oracle解通常与先前任务最优解保持低损失线性连接，这为解决灾难性遗忘提供了新思路

Method: 提出增量向量变换(IVT)框架，周期性将模型参数变换到保持与先前任务最优解线性连接性的解，使用对角Fisher信息矩阵高效近似变换

Result: 在CIFAR-100上提升PASS基线最后准确率5.12%，在FGVCAircraft上提升CLIP预训练SLCA基线平均准确率14.93%和最后准确率21.95%

Conclusion: IVT是有效的即插即用框架，能显著缓解灾难性遗忘，适用于无示例和有示例场景，与多种初始化策略兼容

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of
new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent
progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps
compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to
historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC),
we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a
fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss
linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding,
we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play
framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather
than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model
parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to
previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths,
IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The
transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information
Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based
scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full
demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL
baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the
PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the
CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in
average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注使用一阶泰勒近似进行引导以提高采样效率，但在离散状态空间中这种近似可能不准确，因为近似误差可能很大。

Method: 推导出给定离散流匹配模型的期望分布的确切转移率，实现只需单次前向传播的引导方法，该框架足够通用，包含现有引导方法作为特例，并可无缝应用于掩码扩散模型。

Conclusion: 提出的离散引导匹配框架为离散数据提供了一种高效且精确的引导方法，显著提升了采样效率，并在多个任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by
steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling
discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the
first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However,
such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the
approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete
data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate
for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model,
leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling
step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is
general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it
can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and
preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding
tasks. The code is available through

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAMs为了可解释性牺牲高阶交互效应，CESR包含全特征交互但性能不如GAMs，需要平衡可解释性和预测性能

Method: MACMs包含乘法部分和加法部分，分离交互项和独立项的系数，扩展假设空间，两部分形状函数都可可视化

Result: 基于神经网络的MACMs在预测性能上显著优于CESR和最先进的GAMs

Conclusion: MACMs在保持可解释性的同时，通过结合乘法和加法模型有效提升了预测性能，是对CESR和GAMs的改进

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

Conclusion: 理论分析揭示了有限训练样本下生成模型的行为特性，实验在生成任务和分类等下游任务中验证了理论结果。

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical behavior of generative models under
finite training populations. Within the stochastic interpolation generative
framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal velocity field and
score function when only a finite number of training samples are available. We
demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the deterministic
generative process exactly recovers the training samples, while the stochastic
generative process manifests as training samples with added Gaussian noise.
Beyond the idealized setting, we consider model estimation errors and introduce
formal definitions of underfitting and overfitting specific to generative
models. Our theoretical analysis reveals that, in the presence of estimation
errors, the stochastic generation process effectively produces convex
combinations of training samples corrupted by a mixture of uniform and Gaussian
noise. Experiments on generation tasks and downstream tasks such as
classification support our theory.

Conclusion: 该工作连接了时间序列分析和可视化，为能源分析提供了一个可扩展且可解释的框架。

Abstract: The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and
recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale
characteristics of energy data. To address this, we propose a framework that
fine-tunes visual language large models (VLLMs) on 3D graphical representations
of the data. The approach converts 1D time-series into 3D representations using
continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture
temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable
VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and
provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on
real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully
monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate
optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves
validation losses of 0.0952 with CWTs and 0.1064 with RPs on the University of
Sharjah energy dataset, outperforming direct fine-tuning on raw time-series
data (0.1176) for anomaly detection. This work bridges time-series analysis and
visualization, providing a scalable and interpretable framework for energy
analytics.

Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation.
Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear)

easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap
through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the
output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random
location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of
attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization
performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population
level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention
fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to
identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we
analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of
the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it
consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with
optimization by gradient-based algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出SIHD框架，基于结构信息构建自适应层次扩散模型，用于稀疏奖励的长时域离线强化学习，在多个任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有层次扩散方法通常采用固定的两层扩散层次和单一时间尺度，限制了在不同下游任务中的适应性和决策灵活性。

Method: 分析离线轨迹中的结构信息来自适应构建扩散层次，使用状态社区的结构信息增益作为扩散层条件信号，并引入结构熵正则化器减少对离线数据集的过度依赖。

Result: 在具有挑战性的离线RL任务上的广泛评估表明，SIHD在决策性能上显著优于最先进的基线方法，并在多样化场景中展现出优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SIHD框架通过自适应层次扩散和结构信息利用，有效解决了长时域稀疏奖励环境中的离线策略学习问题，提供了更灵活和稳定的决策能力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative methods have shown promising potential for
modeling trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, and
hierarchical diffusion has been introduced to mitigate variance accumulation
and computational challenges in long-horizon planning tasks. However, existing
approaches typically assume a fixed two-layer diffusion hierarchy with a single
predefined temporal scale, which limits adaptability to diverse downstream
tasks and reduces flexibility in decision making. In this work, we propose
SIHD, a novel Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion framework for
effective and stable offline policy learning in long-horizon environments with
sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze structural information embedded in
offline trajectories to construct the diffusion hierarchy adaptively, enabling
flexible trajectory modeling across multiple temporal scales. Rather than
relying on reward predictions from localized sub-trajectories, we quantify the
structural information gain of each state community and use it as a
conditioning signal within the corresponding diffusion layer. To reduce
overreliance on offline datasets, we introduce a structural entropy regularizer
that encourages exploration of underrepresented states while avoiding
extrapolation errors from distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on
challenging offline RL tasks show that SIHD significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in decision-making performance and demonstrates
superior generalization across diverse scenarios.

*Taeyoung Yun,Pierre-Luc St-Charles,Jinkyoo Park,Yoshua Bengio,Minsu Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Active Attacks算法，通过自适应探索策略生成多样化的攻击提示，用于LLM安全微调，显著提升攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RL的攻击方法在找到高奖励提示后容易陷入局部最优，难以覆盖多种有害行为模式，需要显式的多样性目标来发现更广泛的漏洞。

Method: 引入Active Attacks算法，通过定期用收集的攻击提示对受害者LLM进行安全微调，使已利用区域的奖励减少，迫使攻击者寻找新的漏洞，形成从易到难的探索课程。

Result: Active Attacks将对抗GFlowNets的跨攻击成功率从0.07%提升至31.28%（相对增益超过400倍），计算成本仅增加6%。

Conclusion: Active Attacks作为一种即插即用模块，能有效发现广泛的本地攻击模式，在RL-based红队测试中表现优异。

Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large
language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual
content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual
prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning
(RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as
a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant
challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing
diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward
prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the
active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce
\textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its
attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim
LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which
forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally
induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses
beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active
Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their
combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active
Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing
RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including
GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates
against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a
relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in
computation. Our code is publicly available

TL;DR: 提出了一种难度自适应推理方法，让大型音频语言模型能够根据问题复杂度动态调整推理深度，避免简单问题过度推理和复杂问题推理不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常采用固定的推理深度，导致简单问题产生冗余推理，而复杂问题推理不足，缺乏细粒度的推理深度调节机制。

Method: 提出奖励函数，将推理长度与模型感知的问题难度动态关联，鼓励对简单任务使用简短推理，对复杂任务使用深入推理。

Result: 实验表明该方法既有效又高效，同时提升任务性能并显著减少平均推理长度。

Conclusion: 难度自适应推理方法为大型音频语言模型提供了智能推理机制，未来工作可从推理结构范式获得有价值的见解。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), powered by the chain-of-thought (CoT)
paradigm, have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities. Intuitively, different
problems often require varying depths of reasoning. While some methods can
determine whether to reason for a given problem, they typically lack a
fine-grained mechanism to modulate how much to reason. This often results in a
``one-size-fits-all'' reasoning depth, which generates redundant overthinking
for simple questions while failing to allocate sufficient thought to complex
ones. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LALMs and find that an
effective and efficient LALM should reason smartly by adapting its reasoning
depth to the problem's complexity. To achieve this, we propose a
difficulty-adaptive reasoning method for LALMs. Specifically, we propose a
reward function that dynamically links reasoning length to the model's
perceived problem difficulty. This reward encourages shorter, concise reasoning
for easy tasks and more elaborate, in-depth reasoning for complex ones.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and
efficient, simultaneously improving task performance and significantly reducing
the average reasoning length. Further analysis on reasoning structure paradigm
offers valuable insights for future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRAMDTI是一个多模态预训练框架，通过整合小分子和蛋白质的多模态信息来提升药物-靶点相互作用预测性能，采用体积对比学习和自适应模态丢弃技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DTI预测方法主要依赖SMILES-蛋白质对，未能充分利用小分子和蛋白质的丰富多模态信息，限制了预测性能。

Method: 提出GRAMDTI框架：1）整合四种分子和蛋白质模态的统一表示；2）扩展体积对比学习到四模态；3）引入自适应模态丢弃动态调节各模态贡献；4）结合IC50活性测量作为弱监督。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，GRAMDTI持续优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究证明了高阶多模态对齐、自适应模态利用和辅助监督对于构建鲁棒且可泛化的DTI预测模型的重要性。

Abstract: Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a cornerstone of computational
drug discovery, enabling rational design, repurposing, and mechanistic
insights. While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches
primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal
information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a
pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs
into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning
to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond
conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we
propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's
contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements,
when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations
in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly
available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of
the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order
multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision
for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.

*Cheng Jin,Qitan Shi,Yuantao Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 分析了分类器自由引导(CFG)在扩散模型中的采样动态，揭示了其在多模态条件分布下的三阶段过程：方向偏移、模式分离和集中阶段，解释了为什么强引导会提高语义对齐但减少多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG被广泛用于提高扩散模型的条件保真度，但其对采样动态的影响尚未被充分理解。现有研究多局限于单模态条件分布或简化情况，无法提供完整的理论解释。

Method: 通过分析CFG在多模态条件分布下的行为，将采样过程分解为三个连续阶段，并通过实验验证理论预测。

Result: 实验证实早期强引导会侵蚀全局多样性，而晚期强引导会抑制细粒度变化。提出的时变引导调度方案能同时改善质量和多样性。

Conclusion: CFG的采样过程遵循三阶段动态，强引导在提高语义对齐的同时不可避免地减少多样性，时变引导调度是有效的改进方案。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used to improve conditional fidelity
in diffusion models, but its impact on sampling dynamics remains poorly
understood. Prior studies, often restricted to unimodal conditional
distributions or simplified cases, provide only a partial picture. We analyze
CFG under multimodal conditionals and show that the sampling process unfolds in
three successive stages. In the Direction Shift stage, guidance accelerates
movement toward the weighted mean, introducing initialization bias and norm
growth. In the Mode Separation stage, local dynamics remain largely neutral,
but the inherited bias suppresses weaker modes, reducing global diversity. In
the Concentration stage, guidance amplifies within-mode contraction,
diminishing fine-grained variability. This unified view explains a widely
observed phenomenon: stronger guidance improves semantic alignment but
inevitably reduces diversity. Experiments support these predictions, showing
that early strong guidance erodes global diversity, while late strong guidance
suppresses fine-grained variation. Moreover, our theory naturally suggests a
time-varying guidance schedule, and empirical results confirm that it
consistently improves both quality and diversity.

Result: 在Crafter和Craftax-Classic环境上的实验结果表明，SGRL方法相比现有最优方法取得了更优越的性能

Conclusion: SGRL方法通过结构化目标规划和动作剪枝机制，有效解决了LLM增强RL中的语义不匹配问题，显著提升了探索效率和决策性能

Abstract: Real-world decision-making tasks typically occur in complex and open
environments, posing significant challenges to reinforcement learning (RL)
agents' exploration efficiency and long-horizon planning capabilities. A
promising approach is LLM-enhanced RL, which leverages the rich prior knowledge
and strong planning capabilities of LLMs to guide RL agents in efficient
exploration. However, existing methods mostly rely on frequent and costly LLM
invocations and suffer from limited performance due to the semantic mismatch.
In this paper, we introduce a Structured Goal-guided Reinforcement Learning
(SGRL) method that integrates a structured goal planner and a goal-conditioned
action pruner to guide RL agents toward efficient exploration. Specifically,
the structured goal planner utilizes LLMs to generate a reusable, structured
function for goal generation, in which goals are prioritized. Furthermore, by
utilizing LLMs to determine goals' priority weights, it dynamically generates
forward-looking goals to guide the agent's policy toward more promising
decision-making trajectories. The goal-conditioned action pruner employs an
action masking mechanism that filters out actions misaligned with the current
goal, thereby constraining the RL agent to select goal-consistent policies. We
evaluate the proposed method on Crafter and Craftax-Classic, and experimental
results demonstrate that SGRL achieves superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器发现的特征具有模糊性和无基础性，无法可靠地用于模型行为的主动因果探测。

Method: 采用双重监督的混合解缠策略，创建语义基础的概念标记。

Result: 产生的标记具有显著忠实性和空间局部性，在解缠方面优于其他方法，支持直接干预和对抗漏洞定位。

Conclusion: Concept-SAE为超越相关性解释，实现模型行为的机制性因果探测提供了验证蓝图。

Abstract: Standard Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) excel at discovering a dictionary of a
model's learned features, offering a powerful observational lens. However, the
ambiguous and ungrounded nature of these features makes them unreliable
instruments for the active, causal probing of model behavior. To solve this, we
introduce Concept-SAE, a framework that forges semantically grounded concept
tokens through a novel hybrid disentanglement strategy. We first quantitatively
demonstrate that our dual-supervision approach produces tokens that are
remarkably faithful and spatially localized, outperforming alternative methods
in disentanglement. This validated fidelity enables two critical applications:
(1) we probe the causal link between internal concepts and predictions via
direct intervention, and (2) we probe the model's failure modes by
systematically localizing adversarial vulnerabilities to specific layers.
Concept-SAE provides a validated blueprint for moving beyond correlational
interpretation to the mechanistic, causal probing of model behavior.

TL;DR: AEGIS是一个针对稀疏二分知识图谱的边增强框架，通过重采样现有训练边来提升链接预测性能，避免伪造节点端点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小众领域二分知识图谱数据稀缺和边稀疏的问题，这些特性阻碍了链接预测的性能。

Method: 使用边重采样方法（均匀简单采样或逆度偏置采样），保持原始节点集不变。在自然稀疏图和人工稀疏化基准数据集上测试，评估AUC-ROC和Brier分数。

Result: 在Amazon和MovieLens上，基于复制的AEGIS变体与基线相当，而语义KNN增强是唯一能恢复AUC和校准的方法。在GDP图上，语义KNN获得最大AUC提升和Brier分数降低。

Conclusion: 真实性约束的重采样是稀疏二分链接预测的数据高效策略，当有信息丰富的节点描述时，语义增强能提供额外提升。

Abstract: Bipartite knowledge graphs in niche domains are typically data-poor and
edge-sparse, which hinders link prediction. We introduce AEGIS (Authentic Edge
Growth In Sparsity), an edge-only augmentation framework that resamples
existing training edges -either uniformly simple or with inverse-degree bias
degree-aware -thereby preserving the original node set and sidestepping
fabricated endpoints. To probe authenticity across regimes, we consider
naturally sparse graphs (game design pattern's game-pattern network) and induce
sparsity in denser benchmarks (Amazon, MovieLens) via high-rate bond
percolation. We evaluate augmentations on two complementary metrics: AUC-ROC
(higher is better) and the Brier score (lower is better), using two-tailed
paired t-tests against sparse baselines. On Amazon and MovieLens, copy-based
AEGIS variants match the baseline while the semantic KNN augmentation is the
only method that restores AUC and calibration; random and synthetic edges
remain detrimental. On the text-rich GDP graph, semantic KNN achieves the
largest AUC improvement and Brier score reduction, and simple also lowers the
Brier score relative to the sparse control. These findings position
authenticity-constrained resampling as a data-efficient strategy for sparse
bipartite link prediction, with semantic augmentation providing an additional
boost when informative node descriptions are available.

Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法无法有效处理天气下游任务的独特挑战，如变量异质性、分辨率多样性和时空覆盖变化，导致在天气基础模型上性能不佳。

Method: WeatherPEFT包含两个创新：1) 前向传播中的任务自适应动态提示，通过内外模式提取动态注入嵌入权重；2) 反向传播中的随机Fisher引导自适应选择，利用Fisher信息识别关键参数并引入随机性稳定选择。

Result: 在三个下游任务上，WeatherPEFT实现了与全参数微调相当的性能，同时使用更少的可训练参数，而现有PEFT方法与全参数微调存在显著差距。

Conclusion: WeatherPEFT为天气基础模型提供了一种高效微调解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算需求，有利于实际部署。

Abstract: While recent advances in machine learning have equipped Weather Foundation
Models (WFMs) with substantial generalization capabilities across diverse
downstream tasks, the escalating computational requirements associated with
their expanding scale increasingly hinder practical deployment. Current
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language
tasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such
as variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage
variations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge
this gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs
incorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass,
Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding
weights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via
internal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature
recalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during
backpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only
leverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical
parameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also
introduces randomness to stabilize the selection. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of WeatherPEFT on three downstream tasks, where
existing PEFT methods show significant gaps versus Full-Tuning, and WeatherPEFT
achieves performance parity with Full-Tuning using fewer trainable parameters.
The code of this work will be released.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在各种语言任务上表现出色，但在组合问题（如可满足性、旅行商问题、基本算术）上表现不佳，需要填补这一能力空白。

Method: 使用普通解码器Transformer（GPT-2），整合数独规则的模仿学习与显式深度优先搜索策略，包括有根据的猜测和回溯机制。

Result: 在数独问题上达到了99%的准确率，相比之前的神经符号方法实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将模仿学习与搜索策略结合，并建立了与上下文变体的Min-Sum Set Cover问题的形式化联系，为LLM解决组合问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite their proficiency in various language tasks, Large Language Models
(LLMs) struggle with combinatorial problems like Satisfiability, Traveling
Salesman Problem, or even basic arithmetic. We address this gap through a novel
approach for solving problems in the class NP. We focus on the paradigmatic
task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99\%) compared to prior
neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures,
our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external
tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple
Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy
involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning,
we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. We provide
a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual
variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and
stochastic optimization.

TL;DR: MCGM是一个轻量级模块，通过高效聚类操作赋予几何图神经网络分层全局上下文，解决了传统GNN在长程相互作用建模上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何GNN擅长捕捉分子几何结构，但其局部偏置的消息传递机制难以建模长程相互作用。现有解决方案存在根本性限制：扩展截断半径导致计算成本随距离立方增长；物理启发核缺乏通用性；傅里叶空间方法需要复杂参数调优且计算开销大。

Method: MCGM通过多阶段聚类全局建模，构建原子簇的多分辨率层次结构，通过动态分层聚类提取全局信息，并通过学习变换传播这些上下文，最终通过残差连接增强原子特征。

Result: 在四个不同骨干架构中无缝集成MCGM，将OE62能量预测误差平均降低26.2%。在AQM上，MCGM实现了最先进的精度（能量17.0 meV，力4.9 meV/Å），同时比Neural P3M少使用20%的参数。

Conclusion: MCGM是一个轻量级、即插即用的模块，能够有效增强几何GNN的全局建模能力，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升长程相互作用建模性能。

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing molecular geometry,
yet their locality-biased message passing hampers the modeling of long-range
interactions. Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff
radii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance;
physics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific
and lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple
parameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead.
We introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight,
plug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global
context through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution
hierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic
hierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned
transformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual
connections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures,
MCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\AA} for
forces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made

Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器存在特征吸收（专用特征捕获通用特征实例）和特征组合（独立特征合并为复合表示）的问题，限制了特征的解耦和可解释性。

Method: 引入新的训练过程，惩罚SAE特征之间的高余弦相似度，强制学习正交特征，计算复杂度随SAE大小线性增长。

Result: OrtSAE发现更多独特特征（+9%），显著减少特征吸收（-65%）和组合（-15%），在虚假相关性移除任务上性能提升6%，其他下游任务性能与传统SAE相当。

Conclusion: 正交约束是解决稀疏自编码器特征吸收和组合问题的有效方法，能够提高特征解耦能力而不显著增加计算开销。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a technique for sparse decomposition of neural
network activations into human-interpretable features. However, current SAEs
suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of
general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where
independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we
introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), a novel approach aimed to mitigate these
issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing
a new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between
SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while
scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational
overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it
with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features,
reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves
performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par
performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.

and aggregates their normalized directions to form a positive semidefinite
non-convexity structure matrix. The projection uses the top-$k$ eigenvectors of
the structure matrix. We give two verifiable guarantees. A pairwise
a-posteriori certificate that bounds the post-projection distortion for each
admissible pair, and an average-case spectral bound that links expected
captured direction energy to the spectrum of the structure matrix, yielding
quantile statements for typical distortion. Our evaluation protocol reports
fixed- and reselected-pairs detour errors and certificate quantiles, enabling
practitioners to check guarantees on their data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MO-GRPO是GRPO的扩展，通过简单的归一化方法自动重新加权奖励函数，解决了GRPO在多目标设置中容易出现的奖励黑客问题，确保所有奖励函数对损失函数的贡献均匀。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO算法在存在准确奖励模型时表现良好，但在许多现实任务中缺乏高可靠性的奖励模型。特别是在多目标设置中，GRPO容易受到奖励黑客攻击，只优化其中一个目标而牺牲其他目标。

Method: 提出MO-GRPO，通过基于奖励函数值方差的归一化方法自动重新加权奖励函数，确保所有奖励函数对损失函数的贡献均匀，同时保持偏好顺序，无需手动调整奖励函数尺度。

Result: 在四个领域进行评估：(i)多臂老虎机问题，(ii)模拟控制任务(Mo-Gymnasium)，(iii)WMT基准的机器翻译任务(En-Ja, En-Zh)，(iv)指令跟随任务。MO-GRPO通过均匀分布奖励组件间的相关性实现稳定学习，性能优于GRPO。

Conclusion: MO-GRPO是多目标强化学习问题中一个有前景的算法，能够稳定学习并均匀优化所有目标。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has been shown to be an effective
algorithm when an accurate reward model is available. However, such a highly
reliable reward model is not available in many real-world tasks. In this paper,
we particularly focus on multi-objective settings, in which we identify that
GRPO is vulnerable to reward hacking, optimizing only one of the objectives at
the cost of the others. To address this issue, we propose MO-GRPO, an extension
of GRPO with a simple normalization method to reweight the reward functions
automatically according to the variances of their values. We first show
analytically that MO-GRPO ensures that all reward functions contribute evenly
to the loss function while preserving the order of preferences, eliminating the
need for manual tuning of the reward functions' scales. Then, we evaluate
MO-GRPO experimentally in four domains: (i) the multi-armed bandits problem,
(ii) simulated control task (Mo-Gymnasium), (iii) machine translation tasks on
the WMT benchmark (En-Ja, En-Zh), and (iv) instruction following task. MO-GRPO
achieves stable learning by evenly distributing correlations among the
components of rewards, outperforming GRPO, showing MO-GRPO to be a promising
algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BrainPro是一个大型EEG基础模型，通过检索式空间学习模块和脑状态解耦模块，解决了现有模型在通道间交互和状态感知表示学习方面的不足，在多个BCI数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型未能显式捕捉通道间和脑区间的交互信息，且由于数据集通道配置不同，要么用自注意力近似空间结构，要么限制在有限通道上训练。此外，当前模型在自监督预训练中很少学习状态感知表示。

Method: 提出BrainPro模型，包含检索式空间学习模块（灵活捕捉不同电极布局下的通道和脑区级交互）和脑状态解耦模块（通过并行编码器与解耦及区域感知重建损失实现状态感知表示学习）。

Result: 在大规模EEG语料库上预训练后，BrainPro在9个公共BCI数据集上实现了最先进的性能和鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: BrainPro能够无缝适应多样化任务和硬件设置，其代码和预训练权重将公开发布。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain
electrical activity, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) and
healthcare. Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have
shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding
methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to
explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which
are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to
varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial
structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common
channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG
datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others,
current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised
pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model
that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture
channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a
brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning
through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction
losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and
hardware settings. Pre-trained on an extensive EEG corpus, BrainPro achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI
datasets. Our codes and the pre-trained weights will be released.

TL;DR: 提出在教师模型训练中引入类内对比损失来丰富软标签中的类内信息，并集成边界损失来解决训练不稳定和收敛慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法中，教师模型主要遵循真实标签作为目标，没有考虑同一类别内的多样性表示，限制了学生模型的泛化能力。

Method: 在教师训练中引入类内对比损失来丰富软标签的类内信息，同时集成边界损失以改善训练稳定性和收敛速度。

Result: 理论分析证明类内对比损失能丰富类内多样性，实验结果表明所提方法有效。

Conclusion: 通过类内对比损失和边界损失的结合，能够有效提升知识蒸馏中软标签的质量，增强学生模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how
the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively.
Existing studies points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels
originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature
variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to
generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing
distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth
labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the
same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss
during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft
labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in
training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is
integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training
stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the
impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It
has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对部分参数迁移在何种条件下有益的理论理解，需要分析参数迁移有效性的关键因素。

Method: 在ReLU CNN的理论框架下分析参数迁移机制，通过数值实验和真实数据实验验证理论发现。

Result: 识别了继承参数作为通用知识载体的作用方式，发现了放大其对目标任务有益影响的关键因素。

Conclusion: 建立了参数迁移的理论基础，解释了参数迁移效果差异的原因，为迁移学习提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Parameter transfer is a central paradigm in transfer learning, enabling
knowledge reuse across tasks and domains by sharing model parameters between
upstream and downstream models. However, when only a subset of parameters from
the upstream model is transferred to the downstream model, there remains a lack
of theoretical understanding of the conditions under which such partial
parameter reuse is beneficial and of the factors that govern its effectiveness.
To address this gap, we analyze a setting in which both the upstream and
downstream models are ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within this
theoretical framework, we characterize how the inherited parameters act as
carriers of universal knowledge and identify key factors that amplify their
beneficial impact on the target task. Furthermore, our analysis provides
insight into why, in certain cases, transferring parameters can lead to lower
test accuracy on the target task than training a new model from scratch.
Numerical experiments and real-world data experiments are conducted to
empirically validate our theoretical findings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 激活导向技术通过向LLM隐藏状态添加语义向量来控制模型行为，但研究发现这种技术会系统性破坏模型的安全防护机制，使其更容易响应有害请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在验证激活导向技术是否真的如宣传那样是精确、可解释且安全的替代微调方法，还是实际上会破坏模型的安全对齐。

Method: 在不同模型家族上进行广泛实验，包括随机方向导向、使用稀疏自编码器提取的良性特征导向，以及组合多个随机向量创建通用攻击。

Result: 随机方向导向可将有害请求的响应概率从0%提升到2-27%；使用SAE良性特征导向进一步增加2-4%；组合20个随机向量可创建通用攻击，显著提高对未见请求的有害响应率。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了"通过可解释性实现安全"的范式，表明对模型内部的精确控制并不能保证对模型行为的精确控制。

Abstract: Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by
adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states
during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and
potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite:
steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply
with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model
families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the
probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign
features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable
directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that
combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a
universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen
requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through
interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not
guarantee precise control over model behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了非线性代理模型扩展(NL-SME)方法，通过可学习的二次贝塞尔曲线建模SGD的非线性参数轨迹，显著提升了联邦学习中梯度反转攻击的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习通过本地数据保护隐私，但梯度反转攻击构成严重威胁。现有方法假设线性参数轨迹，严重低估了SGD的非线性复杂性，限制了攻击效果。

Method: 提出NL-SME方法，用可学习的二次贝塞尔曲线替代线性插值，通过控制点捕捉SGD的曲线特性，结合正则化和dvec缩放机制增强表达能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和FEMNIST数据集上的实验表明，NL-SME在所有指标上显著优于基线方法，在余弦相似度损失上实现了数量级改进，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了联邦学习多步更新范式中的隐私漏洞，并为开发鲁棒防御策略提供了新视角。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, yet
Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) pose significant threats. In FedAVG
multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data
reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume
linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates
SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We
propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to
introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach
replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that
capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with
regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME
significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving
order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining
computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities
in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing
robust defense strategies.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a range

challenge, especially for graph-level tasks. In this work, we introduce
SHAKE-GNN, a novel scalable graph-level GNN framework based on a hierarchy of
Kirchhoff Forests, a class of random spanning forests used to construct
stochastic multi-resolution decompositions of graphs. SHAKE-GNN produces
multi-scale representations, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency
and performance. We introduce an improved, data-driven strategy for selecting
the trade-off parameter and analyse the time-complexity of SHAKE-GNN.
Experimental results on multiple large-scale graph classification benchmarks

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注模型更新的鲁棒性，但忽视了补救建议的时间动态特性，特别是在竞争性资源受限环境中，建议会影响未来申请者群体

Method: 开发了时间感知的算法性补救框架，建模候选人群对建议的适应性响应，并引入基于强化学习的补救算法来捕捉环境演化动态

Conclusion: 将时间和行为动态纳入实际补救系统设计至关重要，提出的方法能够生成在预定时间范围内保持有效的持久性建议

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable
recommendations that increase their chances of receiving favorable outcomes
from automated decision systems (e.g., loan approvals). While prior research
has emphasized robustness to model updates, considerably less attention has
been given to the temporal dynamics of recourse--particularly in competitive,
resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant
pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic
recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to
recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the
environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We
design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined
time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after
taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments
in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially
outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility
and long-term validity. Together, these results underscore the importance of
incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics into the design of practical
recourse systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为运动心理学特质分析提供了可解释的数据驱动框架，可用于运动员发展的决策支持。

Abstract: Psychological attributes rarely operate in isolation: coaches reason about
networks of related traits. We analyze a new dataset of 164 female volleyball
players from Italy's C and D leagues that combines standardized psychological
profiling with background information. To learn directed relationships among
mixed-type variables (ordinal questionnaire scores, categorical demographics,
continuous indicators), we introduce latent MMHC, a hybrid structure learner
that couples a latent Gaussian copula and a constraint-based skeleton with a
constrained score-based refinement to return a single DAG. We also study a
bootstrap-aggregated variant for stability. In simulations spanning sample
size, sparsity, and dimension, latent Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) attains
lower structural Hamming distance and higher edge recall than recent
copula-based learners while maintaining high specificity. Applied to
volleyball, the learned network organizes mental skills around goal setting and
self-confidence, with emotional arousal linking motivation and anxiety, and
locates Big-Five traits (notably neuroticism and extraversion) upstream of
skill clusters. Scenario analyses quantify how improvements in specific skills
propagate through the network to shift preparation, confidence, and
self-esteem. The approach provides an interpretable, data-driven framework for
profiling psychological traits in sport and for decision support in athlete
development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的悲观双层优化方法主要针对分类问题，尚未适应回归场景。在对抗性机器学习中，攻击者会调整数据来影响预测模型的结果，这在垃圾邮件过滤、恶意软件检测等应用中很常见。

Method: 提出了一种悲观双层优化程序，专门针对回归场景设计，不假设攻击者策略的凸性或唯一性。

Result: 该方法能够有效建模回归场景中的对抗性规避攻击，并训练出具有弹性的预测器。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了悲观双层优化的应用范围，为回归场景中的对抗性机器学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial machine learning challenges the assumption that the underlying
distribution remains consistent throughout the training and implementation of a
prediction model. In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where
adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established
prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email
filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods
must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of
malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at
modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such
adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation
which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's
optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats
to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the
adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression
scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation
program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or
uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无critic方法如GRPO虽然降低了内存需求，但由于大量无信息样本和token稀释了关键学习信号，导致收敛缓慢。

Method: D$^3$S框架包含两个层级：样本级选择优势方差最大的rollouts子集，token级选择优势幅度与策略熵乘积高的token。采用动态下采样调度防止过拟合。

Result: 在Qwen2.5和Llama3.1上的实验表明，D$^3$S集成到先进RL算法中实现了最先进的性能和泛化能力，同时需要更少的样本和token。

Conclusion: D$^3$S通过动态双级下采样有效解决了无critic方法收敛慢的问题，在多个推理基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Critic-free methods like GRPO reduce memory demands by estimating advantages
from multiple rollouts but tend to converge slowly, as critical learning
signals are diluted by an abundance of uninformative samples and tokens. To
tackle this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling
(D$^3$S)} framework that prioritizes the most informative samples and tokens
across groups to improve the efficient of policy optimization. D$^3$S operates
along two levels: (1) the sample-level, which selects a subset of rollouts to
maximize advantage variance ($\text{Var}(A)$). We theoretically proven that
this selection is positively correlated with the upper bound of the policy
gradient norms, yielding higher policy gradients. (2) the token-level, which
prioritizes tokens with a high product of advantage magnitude and policy
entropy ($|A_{i,t}|\times H_{i,t}$), focusing updates on tokens where the
policy is both uncertain and impactful. Moreover, to prevent overfitting to
high-signal data, D$^3$S employs a dynamic down-sampling schedule inspired by
curriculum learning. This schedule starts with aggressive down-sampling to
accelerate early learning and gradually relaxes to promote robust
generalization. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1 demonstrate that
integrating D$^3$S into advanced RL algorithms achieves state-of-the-art
performance and generalization while requiring \textit{fewer} samples and
tokens across diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our code is added in the
supplementary materials and will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: VITAL是一个基于大语言模型的框架，专门用于处理电子健康记录中不规则采样的生理时间序列数据，通过区分生命体征和实验室测试两种变量类型，分别采用不同编码策略，在PhysioNet基准数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的时间序列数据存在不规则采样和高缺失率的问题，临床变量根据工作流程和干预时间以不均匀间隔测量，这给建模带来了固有挑战。

Method: VITAL区分两种临床变量：频繁记录的生命体征和零星测量的实验室测试。将生命体征重新编程到语言空间，使LLM能够捕获时间上下文并通过显式编码处理缺失值；实验室变量则使用代表性汇总值或可学习的[未测量]标记进行嵌入。

Result: 在PhysioNet基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，VITAL优于为不规则时间序列设计的最先进方法，并在高缺失率情况下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: VITAL框架有效解决了电子健康记录中不规则采样时间序列的建模挑战，特别适用于真实临床场景中关键变量经常不可用的情况。

Abstract: Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling
time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical
variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and
intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large
language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly
sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct
types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and
exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured
sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the
language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over
missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are
embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not
measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the
benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state
of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it
maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is
prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often
unavailable.

TL;DR: 提出双切片Wasserstein（DSW）距离作为Wasserstein over Wasserstein（WoW）距离的加速替代方案，通过利用1维Wasserstein空间与分位数函数空间的等距性，避免了高阶矩的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的切片WoW加速方法依赖于参数化元测量或高阶矩的存在，导致数值不稳定。需要一种更稳定且计算效率高的方法来比较数据集或图像和形状的分布。

Method: 利用1维Wasserstein空间与L2([0,1])函数空间中分位数函数的等距性，引入任意Banach空间的通用切片Wasserstein框架，通过高斯过程参数化的无限维L2投影定义1维元测量的切片距离，结合欧几里得单位球上的经典积分得到DSW度量。

Result: DSW最小化与离散化元测量的WoW最小化等价，同时避免了不稳定的高阶矩并实现了计算节省。在数据集、形状和图像上的数值实验验证了DSW作为WoW距离的可扩展替代方案。

Conclusion: DSW提供了一个稳定、可扩展且计算高效的WoW距离替代方案，特别适用于比较复杂的数据分布。

Abstract: Wasserstein distances define a metric between probability measures on
arbitrary metric spaces, including meta-measures (measures over measures). The
resulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but
computationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images
and shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures
or the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an
alternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein
space and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this
purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary
Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a
sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional
$L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d
construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields
the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures. We show
that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized
meta-measures, while avoiding unstable higher-order moments and computational
savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as
a scalable substitute for the WoW distance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 向量量化在现代机器学习中广泛应用，但存在非可微量化步骤阻碍梯度反向传播的问题。平滑向量量化通过将硬分配松弛为码本条目的加权组合来解决这个问题，但需要同时满足两个关键属性：(1)保持接近one-hot向量的紧近似，(2)充分利用所有码本条目防止码本崩溃。现有方法通常分别处理这两个需求。

Method: 引入简单直观的正则化方法，通过最小化每个单纯形顶点与其K个最近平滑量化器之间的距离，同时促进平滑量化器保持接近one-hot向量和充分利用所有码本条目。

Result: 在代表性基准测试（包括离散图像自编码和对比语音表示学习）上的实验表明，该方法实现了更可靠的码本利用率，并相比先前方法提高了性能。

Conclusion: 提出的正则化方法能够同时解决平滑向量量化中的两个关键问题，在多个任务上表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Vector quantization, which discretizes a continuous vector space into a
finite set of representative vectors (a codebook), has been widely adopted in
modern machine learning. Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a
fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient
backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing
the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of
codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the
codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers
should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2)
all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing
methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present
study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both
simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its
$K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks,
including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation
learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook
utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.

TL;DR: 本文对LLM推理中的N:M激活剪枝进行了全面分析，发现相比权重剪枝，激活剪枝在相同稀疏度下能更好地保持生成能力，并提出了硬件友好的8:16稀疏模式作为最佳候选方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管半结构化(N:M)剪枝在权重剪枝中已广泛应用，但在激活剪枝方面的研究仍不足。激活剪枝具有动态、输入自适应的压缩潜力，并能减少I/O开销。

Method: 采用训练后N:M激活剪枝方法，评估了轻量级即插即用的误差缓解技术和剪枝标准，建立了硬件友好的基线方法，仅需最小校准。

Result: 激活剪枝在相同稀疏度下比权重剪枝能更好地保持生成能力；16:32模式性能接近非结构化稀疏度，但8:16模式在灵活性和硬件实现复杂度之间达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 研究为激活剪枝提供了有效的实用方法，并激励未来硬件支持更灵活的稀疏模式。8:16稀疏模式是优越的候选方案。

Abstract: The demand for efficient large language model (LLM) inference has intensified
the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is
well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains
underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and
reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of
methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs,
we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of
generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity
levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and
pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require
minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's
standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par
with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between
flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16
pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical
methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support
more flexible sparsity patterns. Our code is available

TL;DR: DYNAWEIGHT是一种新颖的去中心化学习框架，通过动态分配邻居服务器权重来加速训练，特别适用于数据异构场景，且兼容各种底层优化算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在完全去中心化基础设施中，由于缺乏集中聚合，本地处理变得至关重要。传统静态权重分配方法无法有效处理数据异构问题，需要一种能够动态调整权重以利用多样化信息的方案。

Method: DYNAWEIGHT框架基于邻居服务器在本地数据集上的相对损失动态分配权重，优先选择拥有多样化信息的服务器，而不是使用传统的静态权重分配方法。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和CIFAR100数据集上的实验表明，DYNAWEIGHT在不同服务器数量和图拓扑结构下都能显著提高训练速度，同时仅增加最小的通信和内存开销。

Conclusion: DYNAWEIGHT作为一种兼容性强的聚合方案，能够有效加速去中心化学习，特别在数据异构环境中表现优异，具有广泛的集成潜力。

Abstract: In today's data-sensitive landscape, distributed learning emerges as a vital
tool, not only fortifying privacy measures but also streamlining computational
operations. This becomes especially crucial within fully decentralized
infrastructures where local processing is imperative due to the absence of
centralized aggregation. Here, we introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a novel framework to
information aggregation in multi-agent networks. DYNAWEIGHT offers substantial
acceleration in decentralized learning with minimal additional communication
and memory overhead. Unlike traditional static weight assignments, such as
Metropolis weights, DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring
servers based on their relative losses on local datasets. Consequently, it
favors servers possessing diverse information, particularly in scenarios of
substantial data heterogeneity. Our experiments on various datasets MNIST,
CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 incorporating various server counts and graph topologies,
demonstrate notable enhancements in training speeds. Notably, DYNAWEIGHT
functions as an aggregation scheme compatible with any underlying server-level
optimization algorithm, underscoring its versatility and potential for
widespread integration.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效发现数据中的对称群并构建高效的等变函数学习模型，在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown)
equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$
corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal
groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to
uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is
orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its
inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the
neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and
efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms,
while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant
model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group
action.
  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the
function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group
action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an
angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a
scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple.
This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs
while preserving the underlying group symmetry.
  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including
polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix
prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our
model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and
efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.

Conclusion: 该框架阐明了在不依赖统计假设的情况下解耦表示可被识别的条件，为解耦学习提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: Disentangled representations seek to recover latent factors of variation
underlying observed data, yet their identifiability is still not fully
understood. We introduce a unified framework in which disentanglement is
achieved through mechanistic independence, which characterizes latent factors
by how they act on observed variables rather than by their latent distribution.
This perspective is invariant to changes of the latent density, even when such
changes induce statistical dependencies among factors. Within this framework,
we propose several related independence criteria -- ranging from support-based
and sparsity-based to higher-order conditions -- and show that each yields
identifiability of latent subspaces, even under nonlinear, non-invertible
mixing. We further establish a hierarchy among these criteria and provide a
graph-theoretic characterization of latent subspaces as connected components.
Together, these results clarify the conditions under which disentangled
representations can be identified without relying on statistical assumptions.

Conclusion: KReTTaH提供了一个灵活且可解释的多维数据插补框架，能够有效整合图结构先验，在动态图流估计中表现出色

Abstract: A regression-based framework for interpretable multi-way data imputation,
termed Kernel Regression via Tensor Trains with Hadamard overparametrization
(KReTTaH), is introduced. KReTTaH adopts a nonparametric formulation by casting
imputation as regression via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Parameter
efficiency is achieved through tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank, which
reside on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and is further enhanced via
Hadamard overparametrization, which promotes sparsity within the TT parameter
space. Learning is accomplished by solving a smooth inverse problem posed on
the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. As a representative
application, the estimation of dynamic graph flows is considered. In this
setting, KReTTaH exhibits flexibility by seamlessly incorporating graph-based
(topological) priors via its inverse problem formulation. Numerical tests on
real-world graph datasets demonstrate that KReTTaH consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives-including a nonparametric tensor- and a
neural-network-based methods-for imputing missing, time-varying edge flows.

TL;DR: R-GNS是一个可逆图网络模拟器，通过残差可逆消息传递和共享参数实现前向动力学与逆向推理的统一框架，在耗散流体系统中实现高效准确的正向模拟和逆向状态恢复。


<details>

Conclusion: R-GNS是首个统一正向和逆向模拟的可逆框架，能够为耗散流体系统生成物理一致的轨迹，并高效恢复合理的初始状态。

Abstract: Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a
fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based
simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference
remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are
irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail
to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator
(R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a
single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate
inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse
the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design
based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling
forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and
efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three
dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS
achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the
parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than
optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed
of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates
iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On
goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex
target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically
consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible
framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid
systems.

Motivation: 研究深度学习模型的数据记忆能力，从数据重建角度分析模型参数与训练数据的关系。

Method: 在随机特征模型中，当p > dn时，利用特征空间中的训练样本子空间信息来识别输入空间中的个体样本，并提出优化重建方法。

Result: 提出的重建方法在多种架构（随机特征、两层全连接网络、深度残差网络）上都表现良好，验证了数据重建定律。

Conclusion: 揭示了数据重建定律：当参数数量p超过阈值dn时，可以完整恢复整个训练数据集。

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are known to memorize parts of the training
set. In machine learning theory, memorization is often framed as interpolation
or label fitting, and classical results show that this can be achieved when the
number of parameters $p$ in the model is larger than the number of training
samples $n$. In this work, we consider memorization from the perspective of
data reconstruction, demonstrating that this can be achieved when $p$ is larger
than $dn$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. More specifically, we
show that, in the random features model, when $p \gg dn$, the subspace spanned
by the training samples in feature space gives sufficient information to
identify the individual samples in input space. Our analysis suggests an
optimization method to reconstruct the dataset from the model parameters, and
we demonstrate that this method performs well on various architectures (random
features, two-layer fully-connected and deep residual networks). Our results
reveal a law of data reconstruction, according to which the entire training
dataset can be recovered as $p$ exceeds the threshold $dn$.

Motivation: SO(n)的单参数子群在机器人学、量子力学和分子结构分析等应用中至关重要，需要自动发现这些子群的方法。

Method: 利用斜对称矩阵的标准Jordan形式定义SO(n)的李代数，建立Hγ作用下轨道的规范形式，通过参数学习揭示基础的单参数子群Hγ。

Result: 在双摆建模、转动惯量预测、顶夸克标记和不变多项式回归等任务中，成功恢复了有意义的子群结构并产生了可解释的对称感知表示。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效发现SO(n)的单参数子群，并在多个实际应用中展示了其有效性，为对称感知表示学习提供了新方法。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter
subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter
subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including
robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method
utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the
Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the
action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a
standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning
the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter
subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia
prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it
successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable,
symmetry-aware representations.

Conclusion: 该框架能够帮助利益相关者选择最合适的策略，并为不同问题设置提供了应用指南。

Abstract: Equity in real-world sequential decision problems can be enforced using
fairness-aware methods. Therefore, we require algorithms that can make suitable
and transparent trade-offs between performance and the desired fairness
notions. As the desired performance-fairness trade-off is hard to specify a
priori, we propose a framework where multiple trade-offs can be explored.
Insights provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm regarding the
obtainable performance-fairness trade-offs can then guide stakeholders in
selecting the most appropriate policy. To capture fairness, we propose an
extended Markov decision process, $f$MDP, that explicitly encodes individuals
and groups. Given this $f$MDP, we formalise fairness notions in the context of
sequential decision problems and formulate a fairness framework that computes
fairness measures over time. We evaluate our framework in two scenarios with
distinct fairness requirements: job hiring, where strong teams must be composed
while treating applicants equally, and fraud detection, where fraudulent
transactions must be detected while ensuring the burden on customers is fairly
distributed. We show that our framework learns policies that are more fair
across multiple scenarios, with only minor loss in performance reward.
Moreover, we observe that group and individual fairness notions do not
necessarily imply one another, highlighting the benefit of our framework in
settings where both fairness types are desired. Finally, we provide guidelines
on how to apply this framework across different problem settings.

Motivation: 现有形式化语句相似性度量方法无法平衡语义和结构信息：基于字符串的方法忽略语义，基于证明的方法缺乏分级相似度评分且忽略结构差异。

Method: 将形式化语句转换为操作符树捕获句法结构，使用TransTED相似度度量（增强的树编辑距离，通过变换融入语义感知）计算相似度分数。

Conclusion: ASSESS框架有效整合语义和结构信息，为形式化语句相似性评估提供了更全面的解决方案，TransTED相似度在EPLA基准上表现优异。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from
natural language into formal languages, has seen significant advancements, yet
the development of automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing
metrics for formal statement similarity often fail to balance semantic and
structural information. String-based approaches capture syntactic structure but
ignore semantic meaning, whereas proof-based methods validate semantic
equivalence but disregard structural nuances and, critically, provide no graded
similarity score in the event of proof failure. To address these issues, we
introduce ASSESS (A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement
Similarity), which comprehensively integrates semantic and structural
information to provide a continuous similarity score. Our framework first
transforms formal statements into Operator Trees to capture their syntactic
structure and then computes a similarity score using our novel TransTED
(Transformation Tree Edit Distance) Similarity metric, which enhances
traditional Tree Edit Distance by incorporating semantic awareness through
transformations. For rigorous validation, we present EPLA (Evaluating
Provability and Likeness for Autoformalization), a new benchmark of 524
expert-annotated formal statement pairs derived from miniF2F and ProofNet, with
labels for both semantic provability and structural likeness. Experiments on
EPLA demonstrate that TransTED Similarity outperforms existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest Kappa coefficient. The
benchmark, and implementation code will be made public soon.

recovering the latter in the special case of grid graphs. WIRE also enjoys a
host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node
ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select
assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on
a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic
subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph
benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph
structure is important.

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发鲁棒且忠实的遗忘方法对于语言模型安全部署的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models trained on web-scale data can memorize private or
sensitive knowledge, raising significant privacy risks. Although some
unlearning methods mitigate these risks, they remain vulnerable to "relearning"
during subsequent training, allowing a substantial portion of forgotten
knowledge to resurface. In this paper, we show that widely used unlearning
methods cause shallow alignment: instead of faithfully erasing target
knowledge, they generate spurious unlearning neurons that amplify negative
influence to hide it. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Ssiuu, a new
class of unlearning methods that employs attribution-guided regularization to
prevent spurious negative influence and faithfully remove target knowledge.
Experimental results confirm that our method reliably erases target knowledge
and outperforms strong baselines across two practical retraining scenarios: (1)
adversarial injection of private data, and (2) benign attack using an
instruction-following benchmark. Our findings highlight the necessity of robust
and faithful unlearning methods for safe deployment of language models.

Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety
and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in
machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong
performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to
real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage.
This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing
fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common
dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise
splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To
address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology
centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the
physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate
the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of
co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as
Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset
diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training
bearings is a decisive factor for achieving robust performance. We evaluate our
methodology on three widely adopted datasets: CWRU, Paderborn University (PU),
and University of Ottawa (UORED-VAFCLS). This study highlights the importance
of leakage-aware evaluation protocols and provides practical guidelines for
dataset partitioning, model selection, and validation, fostering the
development of more trustworthy ML systems for industrial fault diagnosis
applications.

Result: 实证评估表明，Spectral Uncertainty在估计偶然不确定性和总不确定性方面优于现有最先进方法，在多种模型和基准数据集上都表现出色。

Conclusion: Spectral Uncertainty为LLMs提供了一种有效的不确定性量化和分解方法，能够更精确地区分不同来源的不确定性，有助于提升模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in diverse
applications, obtaining reliable measures of their predictive uncertainty has
become critically important. A precise distinction between aleatoric
uncertainty, arising from inherent ambiguities within input data, and epistemic
uncertainty, originating exclusively from model limitations, is essential to
effectively address each uncertainty source. In this paper, we introduce
Spectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing
uncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum
information theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical
foundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and
epistemic components. Unlike existing baseline methods, our approach
incorporates a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity, enabling
nuanced differentiation among various semantic interpretations in model
responses. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Spectral Uncertainty
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total
uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE架构在时间序列分析中存在任务无关路由和缺乏通道相关性建模能力的问题，无法适应多样化的时间序列任务需求。

Method: 提出Recurrent Noisy Gating机制利用分层信息进行任务感知路由，在时间和通道维度上操作，并通过精心设计的时空负载平衡损失来建模复杂相关性。

Result: 在五个下游任务上的综合实验表明，PatchMoE实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: PatchMoE通过任务感知的路由策略和时空相关性建模，成功解决了传统MoE在时间序列分析中的局限性，为多样化时间序列任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such
as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data
in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP,
still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due
to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel
correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series
framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization
for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical
representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification,
we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in
routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is
operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and
encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss
to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive
experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of PatchMoE.

TL;DR: 提出基于扩散自编码器的无线语义通信系统，从语义空间映射到真实数据分布，解决了传统自编码器在信号分布探索不足和解码器耦合的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义通信系统主要关注信道自适应神经编解码方案，缺乏对信号分布的充分探索，且采用自编码器架构导致编码与解码紧密耦合，存在可扩展性问题。

Method: 在语义发射器使用神经编码器提取高级语义，在语义接收器使用条件扩散模型进行信号空间去噪，将接收到的语义潜在变量作为条件输入来引导解码过程。

Result: 理论证明所提出的解码器模型是真实数据的一致估计器，在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上的仿真显示其性能优于传统自编码器和变分自编码器。

Conclusion: 扩散自编码器模型为无线语义通信提供了有效的解决方案，能够学习从语义到真实分布的映射，在多用户语义通信场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) systems aim to learn the mapping from
low-dimensional semantics to high-dimensional ground-truth. While this is more
akin to a "domain translation" problem, existing frameworks typically emphasize
on channel-adaptive neural encoding-decoding schemes, lacking full exploration
of signal distribution. Moreover, such methods so far have employed
autoencoder-based architectures, where the encoding is tightly coupled to a
matched decoder, causing scalability issues in practice. To address these gaps,
diffusion autoencoder models are proposed for wireless SemCom. The goal is to
learn a "semantic-to-clean" mapping, from the semantic space to the
ground-truth probability distribution. A neural encoder at semantic transmitter
extracts the high-level semantics, and a conditional diffusion model (CDiff) at
the semantic receiver exploits the source distribution for signal-space
denoising, while the received semantic latents are incorporated as the
conditioning input to "steer" the decoding process towards the semantics
intended by the transmitter. It is analytically proved that the proposed
decoder model is a consistent estimator of the ground-truth data. Furthermore,
extensive simulations over CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets are provided along with
design insights, highlighting the performance compared to legacy autoencoders
and variational autoencoders (VAE). Simulations are further extended to the
multi-user SemCom, identifying the dominating factors in a more realistic
setup.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于多目标非凸约束松弛模型的高效超图划分框架，采用改进的加速近端梯度算法生成多样化顶点特征，结合MST策略和细化策略提升划分质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超图划分方法容易陷入局部最优，划分质量有待提升，需要开发更高效的算法来处理不同规模的数据。

Method: 使用多目标非凸约束松弛模型和加速近端梯度算法生成顶点特征；针对不同数据规模设计两种MST策略：小数据用Prim算法构建MST后剪枝聚类，大数据选择代表节点构建小MST；引入贪心迁移、交换和递归MST聚类等细化策略。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，相比KaHyPar在2、3、4路划分中平均减少2%-5%的割边大小，特定实例提升达35%；在加权顶点集上优于KaHyPar、hMetis、Mt-KaHyPar和K-SpecPart；细化策略可将hMetis划分结果提升达16%。

Conclusion: 该方法在超图划分质量上具有显著优势，特别是在加权顶点集上表现突出，验证了算法的竞争力和性能权衡特征。

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient hypergraph partitioning framework based on a
novel multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation model. A modified
accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is employed to generate diverse
$k$-dimensional vertex features to avoid local optima and enhance partition
quality. Two MST-based strategies are designed for different data scales: for
small-scale data, the Prim algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree
followed by pruning and clustering; for large-scale data, a subset of
representative nodes is selected to build a smaller MST, while the remaining
nodes are assigned accordingly to reduce complexity. To further improve
partitioning results, refinement strategies including greedy migration,
swapping, and recursive MST-based clustering are introduced for partitions.
  Experimental results on public benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm achieves reductions in cut size of approximately 2\%--5\% on average
compared to KaHyPar in 2, 3, and 4-way partitioning, with improvements of up to
35\% on specific instances. Particularly on weighted vertex sets, our algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art partitioners including KaHyPar, hMetis,
Mt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart, highlighting its superior partitioning quality and
competitiveness. Furthermore, the proposed refinement strategy improves hMetis
partitions by up to 16\%. A comprehensive evaluation based on virtual instance
methodology and parameter sensitivity analysis validates the algorithm's
competitiveness and characterizes its performance trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测模型存在两个问题：单模态基础模型无法显式利用文本等模态中的领域知识；端到端多模态监督模型不支持跨域场景的零样本推理。需要开发支持多模态输入和零样本推理的基础模型。

Method: 通过分词、编码和蒸馏提取多模态领域知识，使用模态引导的多头自注意力机制将知识注入时间表示建模，在解码阶段采用原型引导的流匹配进行生成式概率预测。

Result: 在TimeMMD、TSFM-Bench和ProbTS等基准测试中，Aurora在单模态和多模态场景下均取得一致的最先进性能。

Conclusion: Aurora通过有效利用多模态领域知识和支持零样本推理，显著提升了时间序列预测的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting
because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due
to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal
time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models.
Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts,
the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the
performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not
support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we
introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports
multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain
Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key
domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus
possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization,
encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as
guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to
inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding
phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and
prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow
Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on
well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS,
demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both
unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HEAPr是一种新颖的MoE模型剪枝算法，通过将专家分解为原子专家进行细粒度剪枝，利用二阶信息评估重要性，显著降低内存需求同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构虽然性能优异且推理成本低，但参数量巨大导致内存需求过高，限制了实际部署。现有的专家级剪枝方法粒度太粗，会导致显著的精度下降。

Method: 将专家分解为更小的原子专家，利用类似OBS理论的二阶信息评估原子专家重要性。通过转换和简化二阶信息，将空间复杂度从O(d^4)降低到O(d^2)，仅需在小校准集上进行两次前向和一次反向传播。

Result: 在DeepSeek MoE和Qwen MoE等模型上的实验表明，HEAPr在广泛的压缩比和基准测试中优于现有专家级剪枝方法。在20%~25%压缩比下实现近乎无损压缩，同时减少约20%的FLOPs。

Conclusion: HEAPr通过原子专家剪枝和高效二阶信息利用，实现了MoE模型的高效压缩，在保持性能的同时显著降低了内存需求和计算成本。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs)
deliver exceptional performance and reduced inference costs compared to dense
LLMs. However, their large parameter counts result in prohibitive memory
requirements, limiting practical deployment. While existing pruning methods
primarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to
substantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel
pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic
experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure
the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information
based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address
the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information,
HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the
second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert
parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic
expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where
d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward
passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the
importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including
DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing
expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and
benchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at
compression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs
nearly by 20%. The code can be found at

Result: 在最近发布的产率预测数据集上，SoDaDE表现优于之前的表示方法

Conclusion: 数据驱动的指纹可以在小数据集上创建，并建立了可应用于其他领域的工作流程

Abstract: Computational representations have become crucial in unlocking the recent
growth of machine learning algorithms for chemistry. Initially hand-designed,
machine learning has shown that meaningful representations can be learnt from
data. Chemical datasets are limited and so the representations learnt from data
are generic, being trained on broad datasets which contain shallow information
on many different molecule types. For example, generic fingerprints lack
physical context specific to solvents. However, the use of harmful solvents is
a leading climate-related issue in the chemical industry, and there is a surge
of interest in green solvent replacement. To empower this research, we propose
a new solvent representation scheme by developing Solvent Data Driven
Embeddings (SoDaDE). SoDaDE uses a small transformer model and solvent property
dataset to create a fingerprint for solvents. To showcase their effectiveness,
we use SoDaDE to predict yields on a recently published dataset, outperforming
previous representations. We demonstrate through this paper that data-driven
fingerprints can be made with small datasets and set-up a workflow that can be
explored for other applications.

Method: APB是一种元迁移强化学习方法，在共享骨干网络前后插入轻量级线性层，实现参数高效微调。

Result: APB在样本效率上优于标准强化学习，并能适应分布外任务，而现有元强化学习方法在这些任务上通常失败。

Conclusion: APB方法通过参数高效微调有效解决了任务不匹配问题，特别是在分布外设置下表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive results across domains,
yet learning an optimal policy typically requires extensive interaction data,
limiting practical deployment. A common remedy is to leverage priors, such as
pre-collected datasets or reference policies, but their utility degrades under
task mismatch between training and deployment. While prior work has sought to
address this mismatch, it has largely been restricted to in-distribution
settings. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB),
a meta-transfer RL method that inserts lightweight linear layers before and
after a shared backbone, thereby enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) while preserving prior knowledge during adaptation. Our results show
that APB improves sample efficiency over standard RL and adapts to
out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks where existing meta-RL baselines typically
fail.

Result: 在VGG、ResNet和ViT架构上的实验表明，PWL训练的模型保持竞争力蒸馏性能，随着教师层加载逐步提升精度，最终达到完整教师模型精度而不影响初始推理速度

Conclusion: PWL特别适合动态、资源受限的部署场景，在保持响应性的同时确保性能，解决了知识蒸馏中性能与速度的权衡问题

Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in
higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model
loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant
challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model
loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience.
While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large
teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced
performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading
(PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying
a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those
of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we
introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature
representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the
overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG,
ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain
competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher
layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without
compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for
dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and
performance are critical.

Conclusion: Hessian谱崩溃是导致神经网络失去可塑性的关键因素，通过针对性的正则化方法可以有效维持网络的学习能力。

Abstract: We investigate why deep neural networks suffer from \emph{loss of plasticity}
in deep continual learning, failing to learn new tasks without reinitializing
parameters. We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse
at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and
gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition
for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and
show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this
framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker
factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization
enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying $L2$
penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks
confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.

Motivation: 生存数据通常包含不完整的事件信息（如删失），这对合成数据生成提出了独特挑战。需要忠实复现事件时间分布和删失机制，以支持临床研究。

Method: 提出SurvDiff扩散模型，使用生存定制的损失函数联合生成混合类型协变量、事件时间和右删失，该损失函数编码时间到事件结构并直接优化下游生存任务。

Conclusion: SurvDiff是第一个明确设计用于生成合成生存数据的扩散模型，能够真实复现事件时间分布并保持删失机制。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a cornerstone of clinical research by modeling
time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis, disease relapse, or patient death.
Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event
information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up. This poses unique challenges
for synthetic data generation, where it is crucial for clinical research to
faithfully reproduce both the event-time distribution and the censoring
mechanism. In this paper, we propose SurvDiff, an end-to-end diffusion model
specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis.
SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly
generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a
survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure
and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that
SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii) preserves
the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that \survdiff
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both
distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics across multiple
medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, SurvDiff is the first diffusion
model explicitly designed for generating synthetic survival data.

Abstract: The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological
neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet
prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted
with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment
learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth
and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1)
we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core
mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive
error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge;
and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world
model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture
affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the
potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind
the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse
environments.

TL;DR: 提出随机激活策略，在LLM前馈层中随机选择SILU或RELU非线性函数，解决RELU的梯度流问题，可用于预训练和文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RELU激活函数在负输入区域梯度为零的问题，同时利用RELU的稀疏性优势来减少推理计算量。

Method: 在预训练阶段使用伯努利分布随机选择SILU或RELU激活函数，微调时固定使用RELU；在生成任务中直接使用随机激活策略。

Result: 预训练+微调方案比直接训练RELU效果更好，推理时CPU速度显著提升；生成任务中性能略低于最佳确定性方法但提供了文本多样性控制。

Conclusion: 随机激活策略有效解决了RELU的优化问题，在保持性能的同时实现了推理加速和生成多样性控制。

Abstract: We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects
between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large
language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a
Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated
with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the
gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:
  (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model
with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors.
This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in
the CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from
scratch with the RELU activation function.
  (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs
reasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic
non-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an
alternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase
the diversity of the generated text.

Abstract: Deep neural networks learn feature representations via complex geometric
transformations of the input data manifold. Despite the models' empirical
success across domains, our understanding of neural feature representations is
still incomplete. In this work we investigate neural feature geometry through
the lens of discrete geometry. Since the input data manifold is typically
unobserved, we approximate it using geometric graphs that encode local
similarity structure. We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these
graphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role
in shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we
discover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on
these graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to
Ricci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000
feedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both
synthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class
separability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the
associated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci
flow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for
locally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete
Ricci flow dynamics. Our results suggest practical design principles, including
a geometry-informed early-stopping heuristic and a criterion for selecting
network depth.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型音频语言模型（LALMs）中思维链（CoT）表示的真实性，通过多种干预方法在SAKURA和MMAR数据集上进行测试，发现LALMs生成的CoT通常能忠实反映其决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明文本LLMs的思维链往往不真实，但LALMs中的真实性问题尚未探索。由于LALMs需要先从音频中提取线索再进行推理，其真实性对安全敏感应用至关重要。

Method: 应用多种针对性干预方法：改写、填充标记注入、提前回答和引入错误，在两个具有挑战性的推理数据集SAKURA和MMAR上测试LALMs的CoT真实性。

Result: 经过多个数据集和任务的干预实验，结果表明LALMs通常能生成忠实反映其底层决策过程的CoT表示。

Conclusion: 与文本LLMs不同，LALMs生成的思维链在大多数情况下是真实的，这对于安全敏感应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations
accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable
explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often
unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models
(LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications.
Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract
relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we
investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying
targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early
answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets:
SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across
several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally
produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在信用风险评估中面临高维数据、有限可解释性、罕见事件检测和多类别不平衡等挑战，需要更稳健的模型来支持金融决策。

Method: 提出元学习框架，整合监督学习算法（XGBoost、随机森林、SVM、决策树）、无监督方法（K近邻）、深度学习架构（多层感知机）、LASSO正则化进行特征选择，以及纠错输出码作为元分类器处理不平衡多类别问题，并使用排列特征重要性分析增强模型透明度。

Conclusion: 该研究通过解决信用风险建模中的三个基本挑战，为开发更准确可靠的金融决策支持计算模型做出了贡献，提供了更全面的信用风险评估方法。

Abstract: Effective credit risk management is fundamental to financial decision-making,
necessitating robust models for default probability prediction and financial
entity classification. Traditional machine learning approaches face significant
challenges when confronted with high-dimensional data, limited
interpretability, rare event detection, and multi-class imbalance problems in
risk assessment. This research proposes a comprehensive meta-learning framework
that synthesizes multiple complementary models: supervised learning algorithms,
including XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree;
unsupervised methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors; deep learning architectures
like Multilayer Perceptron; alongside LASSO regularization for feature
selection and dimensionality reduction; and Error-Correcting Output Codes as a
meta-classifier for handling imbalanced multi-class problems. We implement
Permutation Feature Importance analysis for each prediction class across all
constituent models to enhance model transparency. Our framework aims to
optimize predictive performance while providing a more holistic approach to
credit risk assessment. This research contributes to the development of more
accurate and reliable computational models for strategic financial decision
support by addressing three fundamental challenges in credit risk modeling. The
empirical validation of our approach involves an analysis of the Corporate
Credit Ratings dataset with credit ratings for 2,029 publicly listed US
companies. Results demonstrate that our meta-learning framework significantly
enhances the accuracy of financial entity classification regarding credit
rating migrations (upgrades and downgrades) and default probability estimation.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在实际应用中广泛使用，但其内部结构和复杂性使其难以解释。模型透明度和可解释性是在高性能不足以采用解决方案的多个场景中的关键要求。

Method: 将L0正则化的可微分近似应用于多层逻辑感知器(MLLP)，并与随机二值化等替代启发式方法进行比较，研究基于损失函数稀疏化网络而非随机分布的方法效果。

Result: 研究了CRS复杂度与性能之间的权衡关系，比较了不同稀疏化方法的效果。

Conclusion: 使用基于损失函数的稀疏化技术相比随机分布方法可以获得更好的结果，在保持性能的同时有效降低概念规则集的复杂度。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely used in practical applications of AI,
however, their inner structure and complexity made them generally not easily
interpretable. Model transparency and interpretability are key requirements for
multiple scenarios where high performance is not enough to adopt the proposed
solution. In this work, a differentiable approximation of $L_0$ regularization
is adapted into a logic-based neural network, the Multi-layer Logical
Perceptron (MLLP), to study its efficacy in reducing the complexity of its
discrete interpretable version, the Concept Rule Set (CRS), while retaining its
performance. The results are compared to alternative heuristics like Random
Binarization of the network weights, to determine if better results can be
achieved when using a less-noisy technique that sparsifies the network based on
the loss function instead of a random distribution. The trade-off between the
CRS complexity and its performance is discussed.

TL;DR: 提出了SpinGPT，这是首个针对三人在线扑克格式Spin & Go的LLM，通过两阶段训练在多人不完全信息游戏中取得良好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFR算法在多人游戏中计算复杂度呈指数增长，且纳什均衡不再保证不输结果，限制了其在锦标赛等流行格式中的应用。受LLM在棋类和外交游戏中成功的启发，希望用LLM处理多人不完全信息游戏。

Method: 两阶段训练：1）在32万手高额专家决策上进行监督微调；2）在27万手求解器生成的手牌上进行强化学习。

Result: SpinGPT在78%的决策中与求解器行动一致（容忍准确率）。使用简单深筹码启发式方法，在3万手牌中对Slumbot达到13.4±12.9 BB/100的表现（95%置信区间）。

Conclusion: 结果表明LLM可能是处理多人不完全信息游戏（如扑克）的新方法。

Abstract: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm and its variants have
enabled the development of pokerbots capable of beating the best human players
in heads-up (1v1) cash games and competing with them in six-player formats.
However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of
players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash
equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along
with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most
popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language
Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored
to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in
two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions;
(2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show
that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant
accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100
versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest
that LLMs could be a new way to deal with multi-player imperfect-information
games like poker.

Result: 基于12个数据集和21个模型的实验结果显示，ARIMA-LSTM混合模型使用递归方法在大多数情况下优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 多步预测方法和ML模型的选择对提高混合系统性能至关重要，ARIMA-LSTM混合模型在递归方法下表现最优。

Abstract: The decline in interest rates and economic stabilization has heightened the
importance of accurate mortality rate forecasting, particularly in insurance
and pension markets. Multi-step-ahead predictions are crucial for public
health, demographic planning, and insurance risk assessments; however, they
face challenges when data are limited. Hybrid systems that combine statistical
and Machine Learning (ML) models offer a promising solution for handling both
linear and nonlinear patterns. This study evaluated the impact of different
multi-step forecasting approaches (Recursive, Direct, and Multi-Input
Multi-Output) and ML models on the accuracy of hybrid systems. Results from 12
datasets and 21 models show that the selection of both the multi-step approach
and the ML model is essential for improving performance, with the ARIMA-LSTM
hybrid using a recursive approach outperforming other models in most cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实世界视觉环境中，由于感知限制，无法获得精确的位置信息来设计传统基于距离的奖励函数

Method: 使用关键点提取空间距离，学习预测模型作为规划器提出中间子目标，在分层强化学习框架下训练低层策略

Result: 在复杂长视野操作任务中显著加速学习并达到优于现有方法的性能

Conclusion: ReLAM通过自动生成结构化奖励有效解决了视觉强化学习中的奖励设计问题

Abstract: Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning
(RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are
conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However,
such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual
settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a
method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted
from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation
Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured
rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an
anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate
keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a
structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric
objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is
provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound.
Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that
ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoveFM-R是一个融合移动基础模型和大型语言模型的新框架，通过语义增强位置编码、渐进式课程学习和交互式自反机制，解决地理坐标与语言标记的词汇不匹配问题，显著提升移动轨迹生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动基础模型在数据规模和语义理解方面存在局限，而大型语言模型虽然具备强大的语义推理能力，但缺乏对时空统计的固有理解。需要结合两者的优势来生成物理上合理的移动轨迹。

Method: 提出三个核心创新：语义增强位置编码来弥合地理与语言之间的差距；渐进式课程学习来对齐LLM推理与移动模式；交互式自反机制用于条件轨迹生成。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoveFM-R显著优于现有的基于MFM和LLM的基线方法，在零样本设置下表现出强大的泛化能力，并能从自然语言指令生成真实的轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过将MFM的统计能力与LLM的深度语义理解相结合，MoveFM-R开创了一个更全面、可解释和强大的人类移动建模新范式。

Abstract: Mobility Foundation Models (MFMs) have advanced the modeling of human
movement patterns, yet they face a ceiling due to limitations in data scale and
semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful
semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal
statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories.
To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the
full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven
semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary
mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language
tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the
semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a
semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a
progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and
an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms
existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization
in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from
natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs
with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm
that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of
human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoveFM-R-CDE7/.

Motivation: 晶格玻尔兹曼方程虽然能捕捉复杂流动行为，但数值求解计算量大，受碰撞核的严格时间步长限制。

Result: 在复杂流动场景中表现出鲁棒性，包括冯卡门涡街脱落、韧带断裂和气泡粘附等。

Conclusion: 为建模动力学系统建立了一条新的数据驱动途径，适用于不同碰撞模型和动力学数据集。

Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), rooted in kinetic theory, provides a
powerful framework for capturing complex flow behaviour by describing the
evolution of single-particle distribution functions (PDFs). Despite its
success, solving the LBE numerically remains computationally intensive due to
strict time-step restrictions imposed by collision kernels. Here, we introduce
a physics-informed neural operator framework for the LBE that enables
prediction over large time horizons without step-by-step integration,
effectively bypassing the need to explicitly solve the collision kernel. We
incorporate intrinsic moment-matching constraints of the LBE, along with global
equivariance of the full distribution field, enabling the model to capture the
complex dynamics of the underlying kinetic system. Our framework is
discretization-invariant, enabling models trained on coarse lattices to
generalise to finer ones (kinetic super-resolution). In addition, it is
agnostic to the specific form of the underlying collision model, which makes it
naturally applicable across different kinetic datasets regardless of the
governing dynamics. Our results demonstrate robustness across complex flow
scenarios, including von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, and bubble
adhesion. This establishes a new data-driven pathway for modelling kinetic
systems.

Method: 理论分析现有GPL方法，提出UniPrompt方法，该方法适配任何预训练模型，释放预训练模型能力同时保持输入图结构。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法能有效整合各种预训练模型，在领域内和跨领域场景下均取得强劲性能。

Conclusion: 图提示学习应聚焦于释放预训练模型能力，让分类器适应下游场景，UniPrompt方法为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that bridges
graph pretraining models and downstream scenarios, mitigating label dependency
and the misalignment between upstream pretraining and downstream tasks.
Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their
effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two
critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite
current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts
interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying
spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and
representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods
fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data
distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these
issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that
representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple
downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on
unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier adapts to
downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL
method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of
pretrained models while preserving the structure of the input graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various
pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and
cross-domain scenarios.

Motivation: 现有低通信方法通过不频繁的全局同步来减少通信，但其效率仍有提升空间，特别是在内存使用和计算开销方面。

Method: 在本地更新步骤中，每个节点只更新固定的参数子集，其余参数保持冻结，同时保持完整的前向传播以避免跨节点激活交换。

Result: 在32个节点上训练13亿参数语言模型的实验表明，该方法在相同token和带宽预算下达到了先前低通信方法的困惑度，同时减少了训练FLOPs和峰值内存。

Conclusion: 通过限制反向传播范围，可以在保持模型性能的同时显著提升分布式训练的内存和计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce a memory- and compute-efficient method for low-communication
distributed training. Existing methods reduce communication by performing
multiple local updates between infrequent global synchronizations. We
demonstrate that their efficiency can be significantly improved by restricting
backpropagation: instead of updating all the parameters, each node updates only
a fixed subset while keeping the remainder frozen during local steps. This
constraint substantially reduces peak memory usage and training FLOPs, while a
full forward pass over all parameters eliminates the need for cross-node
activation exchange. Experiments on a $1.3$B-parameter language model trained
across $32$ nodes show that our method matches the perplexity of prior
low-communication approaches under identical token and bandwidth budgets while
reducing training FLOPs and peak memory.

Conclusion: 加权乐观跟随正则化领导者算法能有效解决博弈学习中的时间延迟问题，当乐观权重设置适当时，可以恢复无延迟情况下的良好性能表现。

Abstract: This study raises and addresses the problem of time-delayed feedback in
learning in games. Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents
independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often
emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the
future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the
past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that
even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of
regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where
the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We
further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time
delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our
WOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant
($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge
to the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in
poly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and
strengthened by our experiments.

Motivation: 现有方法如Vietoris-Rips复形在计算大规模点云数据的持久同调时面临指数级复杂度问题，Alpha复形和稀疏Rips近似虽然更可扩展，但仍会产生过多单纯形，限制了在大规模点云上的应用。

Method: 引入Flood complex，灵感来自Alpha和Witness复形的优势。在给定过滤值r下，包含点云小子集Delaunay三角剖分中所有被半径为r的球完全覆盖的单纯形，这个过程称为"淹没"。该方法支持GPU并行化。

Result: 在3D点云数据上的扩展实验表明，可以在数百万个点上计算到维度2的持久同调。在真实世界和合成数据的物体分类任务中，性能优于其他基于持久同调的方法和点云数据的神经网络。

Conclusion: Flood complex为大规模点云数据的持久同调计算提供了高效的解决方案，特别适用于几何或拓扑复杂的物体，证明了这种扩展能力在现实应用中的必要性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing persistent homology (PH) for large-scale
Euclidean point cloud data, aimed at downstream machine learning tasks, where
the exponential growth of the most widely-used Vietoris-Rips complex imposes
serious computational limitations. Although more scalable alternatives such as
the Alpha complex or sparse Rips approximations exist, they often still result
in a prohibitively large number of simplices. This poses challenges in the
complex construction and in the subsequent PH computation, prohibiting their
use on large-scale point clouds. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the
Flood complex, inspired by the advantages of the Alpha and Witness complex
constructions. Informally, at a given filtration value $r\geq 0$, the Flood
complex contains all simplices from a Delaunay triangulation of a small subset
of the point cloud $X$ that are fully covered by balls of radius $r$ emanating
from $X$, a process we call flooding. Our construction allows for efficient PH
computation, possesses several desirable theoretical properties, and is
amenable to GPU parallelization. Scaling experiments on 3D point cloud data
show that we can compute PH of up to dimension 2 on several millions of points.
Importantly, when evaluating object classification performance on real-world
and synthetic data, we provide evidence that this scaling capability is needed,
especially if objects are geometrically or topologically complex, yielding
performance superior to other PH-based methods and neural networks for point
cloud data.

Conclusion: 激活函数的平滑性和非线性是神经ODE训练成功的关键，为实际应用中的扩展提供了理论指导

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been successful in various
applications due to their continuous nature and parameter-sharing efficiency.
However, these unique characteristics also introduce challenges in training,
particularly with respect to gradient computation accuracy and convergence
analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by investigating the
impact of activation functions. We demonstrate that the properties of
activation functions, specifically smoothness and nonlinearity, are critical to
the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique
solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is
essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the
global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized
regimes. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments, which
not only support our analysis but also provide practical guidelines for scaling
Neural ODEs, potentially leading to faster training and improved performance in
real-world applications.

Result: 证明了渐近最优目标在Transformer中存在，构建的变分目标在算法任务上能够选择低复杂度解并实现强泛化，但标准优化器难以从随机初始化找到此类解。

Conclusion: 通过提供具有强渐近保证的描述长度目标理论框架，为训练具有更好压缩和泛化能力的神经网络指明了潜在路径。

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for
applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural
networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled,
universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical
notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an
objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive
constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that
asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new
demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such
objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a
variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our
empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a
low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but
standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization,
highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a
theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong
asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural
networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

*Daniil Shlenskii,Alexander Korotin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM)蒸馏框架，用于加速静电生成模型(PFGM++)的采样过程，通过将蒸馏问题转化为逆向问题来学习生成器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFGM++等静电生成模型虽然性能优异，但依赖昂贵的ODE模拟进行采样，计算成本高昂。需要开发高效的蒸馏方法来加速采样过程。

Method: 将蒸馏问题重新表述为逆向问题：学习一个生成器，使其诱导的静电场与教师模型匹配。推导了可处理的训练目标，当D→∞时，该方法接近Score Identity Distillation (SiD)。

Result: IPFM生成的蒸馏生成器仅需少量函数评估就能达到接近甚至优于教师模型的样本质量。有限D值的蒸馏收敛速度比D→∞(扩散模型)时更快。

Conclusion: IPFM是有效的静电生成模型蒸馏框架，有限D值的PFGM++模型具有更优的优化和采样特性，蒸馏效果更好。

Abstract: Electrostatic generative models such as PFGM++ have recently emerged as a
powerful framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image synthesis.
PFGM++ operates in an extended data space with auxiliary dimensionality $D$,
recovering the diffusion model framework as $D\to\infty$, while yielding
superior empirical results for finite $D$. Like diffusion models, PFGM++ relies
on expensive ODE simulations to generate samples, making it computationally
costly. To address this, we propose Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM), a
novel distillation framework that accelerates electrostatic generative models
across all values of $D$. Our IPFM reformulates distillation as an inverse
problem: learning a generator whose induced electrostatic field matches that of
the teacher. We derive a tractable training objective for this problem and show
that, as $D \to \infty$, our IPFM closely recovers Score Identity Distillation
(SiD), a recent method for distilling diffusion models. Empirically, our IPFM
produces distilled generators that achieve near-teacher or even superior sample
quality using only a few function evaluations. Moreover, we observe that
distillation converges faster for finite $D$ than in the $D \to \infty$
(diffusion) limit, which is consistent with prior findings that finite-$D$
PFGM++ models exhibit more favorable optimization and sampling properties.

TL;DR: PIGNN-Attn-LS结合边缘感知注意力机制和回溯线搜索全局化校正算子，显著提升了物理信息图神经网络在AC潮流计算中的精度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理信息图神经网络(PIGNNs)在精度和速度平衡方面仍需改进，特别是物理损失在推理时无效，这阻碍了其在电力系统运行中的实际应用。

Method: 提出PIGNN-Attn-LS方法：1) 边缘感知注意力机制，通过每边偏置显式编码线路物理特性，捕捉电网各向异性；2) 基于回溯线搜索的全局化校正算子，在推理时恢复有效的下降准则。

Result: 在4-32节点高压电网测试中，电压测试RMSE为0.00033 p.u.，角度为0.08°，相比PIGNN-MLP基线分别提升99.5%和87.1%。在4-1024节点电网上的批量推理速度比牛顿-拉夫逊法快2-5倍。

Conclusion: PIGNN-Attn-LS通过结合物理感知的注意力机制和全局化校正，显著提升了AC潮流计算的精度和效率，为电力系统运行提供了可靠的快速求解器。

Abstract: Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC
power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers,
especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current
PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the
physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption.
We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism
that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's
anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction
operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training
and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR
used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of
4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage
and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and
87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$
faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统完整空间公式在优化神经网络时向求解器暴露所有中间变量和约束，导致求解效率较低。本文旨在通过简化空间公式提高优化效率。

Method: 将神经网络视为"灰盒"，只暴露输入输出和导数给优化求解器，在GPU上评估网络输出和导数，避免暴露中间变量和约束。

Result: 在内部点方法中，简化空间公式相比完整空间公式实现了更快的求解速度和更少的迭代次数。在两个优化问题上验证了方法的优势。

Conclusion: 简化空间公式是优化训练好的神经网络的有效方法，特别适合在GPU上执行，能显著提高求解效率。

Abstract: We propose a reduced-space formulation for optimizing over trained neural
networks where the network's outputs and derivatives are evaluated on a GPU. To
do this, we treat the neural network as a "gray box" where intermediate
variables and constraints are not exposed to the optimization solver. Compared
to the full-space formulation, in which intermediate variables and constraints
are exposed to the optimization solver, the reduced-space formulation leads to
faster solves and fewer iterations in an interior point method. We demonstrate
the benefits of this method on two optimization problems: Adversarial
generation for a classifier trained on MNIST images and security-constrained
optimal power flow with transient feasibility enforced using a neural network
surrogate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高阶数值方法虽然提升了Transformer在NLP和CV任务中的性能，但带来了性能与效率的权衡问题，传统效率技术（如蒸馏）可能损害这些模型的性能。

Method: 使用迭代隐式欧拉方法简化高阶方法，提出IIET架构；引入IIAD（迭代影响感知蒸馏）技术，通过灵活阈值来平衡性能与效率。

Result: 在lm-evaluation-harness上，IIET比原始Transformer平均准确率提升2.65%，比PCformer提升0.8%；高效变体E-IIET减少55%推理开销，保留99.4%原始任务准确率；最高效变体在可比速度下比原始Transformer性能提升超过1.6%。

Conclusion: IIET通过迭代隐式欧拉方法有效优化了基于ODE的Transformer架构，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了效率，IIAD技术为性能-效率权衡提供了灵活解决方案。

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like
NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased
computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency
techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of
these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based
Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit
\textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies
high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This
simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates
model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we
introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD
allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On
lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla
Transformers and 0.8\% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET,
significantly cuts inference overhead by 55\% while retaining 99.4\% of the
original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an
average performance gain exceeding 1.6\% over vanilla Transformer with
comparable speed.

TL;DR: C-FREE是一种结合2D图和3D构象的自监督分子表示学习框架，通过预测子图在潜在空间中的互补邻域嵌入来学习分子表示，无需负样本或复杂预处理，在MoleculeNet上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子表示学习方法依赖手工增强或复杂生成目标，且主要使用2D拓扑信息，未能充分利用有价值的3D结构信息。

Method: 使用固定半径的ego-nets作为建模单元，结合2D图和3D构象集成，通过预测子图在潜在空间中的互补邻域嵌入来学习表示，采用混合GNN-Transformer架构。

Result: 在GEOM数据集上预训练后，在MoleculeNet上达到最先进结果，超越了对比学习、生成式和其他多模态自监督方法。

Conclusion: 预训练能有效迁移到新的化学领域，证明了3D信息增强的分子表示的重要性。

Abstract: High-quality molecular representations are essential for property prediction
and molecular design, yet large labeled datasets remain scarce. While
self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many
existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex
generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable
3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce
C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework
that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns
molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their
complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as
modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate
both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or
expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich
3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on
MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal
self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and
molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to
new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular
representations.

<details>

Motivation: Koopman算子作为非线性动力系统的线性表示方法，与再生核希尔伯特空间结合后存在两个主要问题：计算规模大需要稀疏化近似，以及超参数优化和字典学习困难。

Method: 将高斯过程回归与动态模态分解相结合，利用高斯过程方法缓解核方法的计算需求，同时提高对传感器噪声的鲁棒性。

Result: 该方法不仅降低了计算需求，还展示了对传感器噪声更强的抵抗能力，并改进了超参数优化和字典学习过程。

Conclusion: 高斯过程回归与动态模态分解的统一为解决Koopman算子方法中的关键挑战提供了有效途径，特别是在计算效率和噪声鲁棒性方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical
system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently,
Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular
in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into
Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two
pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being
sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to
become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be
reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The
second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to
adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of
this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode
decomposition.

TL;DR: 提出OFMU框架，通过双层优化和相似性感知惩罚机制解决机器遗忘中的梯度冲突问题，在保持模型效用的同时有效移除目标数据的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在敏感应用中，大语言模型需要能够遗忘特定知识（如用户请求、版权材料、过时信息）以满足监管要求、用户隐私和安全需求，但现有方法存在训练不稳定和模型效用下降的问题。

Method: 提出基于惩罚的双层优化框架OFMU，通过内层最大化步骤强制遗忘并引入相似性感知惩罚来解耦遗忘和保留目标的梯度，外层最小化步骤恢复模型效用，并开发了具有收敛保证的两循环算法。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，OFMU在遗忘效果和保留效用方面均优于现有遗忘方法，实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: OFMU框架通过分层优化结构有效解决了机器遗忘中的多目标冲突问题，为大规模模型的安全部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models deployed in sensitive applications increasingly require
the ability to unlearn specific knowledge, such as user requests, copyrighted
materials, or outdated information, without retraining from scratch to ensure
regulatory compliance, user privacy, and safety. This task, known as machine
unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while
maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is
to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a
single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention
losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in
unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting
gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a
penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes
forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our
method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a
similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and
retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step.
To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable
convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further
provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our
approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model
utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and
language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing
unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.

Abstract: We present a machine learning pipeline for biomarker discovery in Multiple

Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). After robust preprocessing we
trained an XGBoost classifier optimized via Bayesian search. SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) were used to identify key features for model prediction,
indicating thus possible biomarkers. These were compared with genes identified
through classical Differential Expression Analysis (DEA). Our comparison
revealed both overlapping and unique biomarkers between SHAP and DEA,
suggesting complementary strengths. Enrichment analysis confirmed the
biological relevance of SHAP-selected genes, linking them to pathways such as
sphingolipid signaling, Th1/Th2/Th17 cell differentiation, and Epstein-Barr

Motivation: 约束优化是神经网络施加要求的强大框架，但传统一阶方法在min-max拉格朗日公式上存在振荡问题且无法找到所有局部解。虽然增广拉格朗日方法解决了这些问题，但实践中更偏好缺乏理论保证的对偶乐观上升方法。

Method: 建立了拉格朗日对偶乐观上升与增广拉格朗日梯度下降上升的等价关系，将ALM的理论保证转移到乐观方法上。

Result: 证明了对偶乐观方法能够线性收敛到所有局部解，并为乐观超参数调优提供了原则性指导。

Conclusion: 填补了经验成功的对偶乐观方法与理论基础之间的关键空白，为实践提供了坚实的理论支撑。

Abstract: Constrained optimization is a powerful framework for enforcing requirements
on neural networks. These constrained deep learning problems are typically
solved using first-order methods on their min-max Lagrangian formulation, but
such approaches often suffer from oscillations and can fail to find all local
solutions. While the Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) addresses these issues,
practitioners often favor dual optimistic ascent schemes (PI control) on the
standard Lagrangian, which perform well empirically but lack formal guarantees.
In this paper, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between these
approaches: dual optimistic ascent on the Lagrangian is equivalent to gradient
descent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian. This finding allows us to transfer
the robust theoretical guarantees of the ALM to the dual optimistic setting,
proving it converges linearly to all local solutions. Furthermore, the
equivalence provides principled guidance for tuning the optimism
hyper-parameter. Our work closes a critical gap between the empirical success
of dual optimistic methods and their theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning
(DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising
user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently
assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however,
not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in
their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical
heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can
lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these
challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to
encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these
challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates
efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the
context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully
heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an
incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated
learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated
learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the
performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of
complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model
architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID
scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease
communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and
model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and
baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH
achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.

Motivation: 生成模型通常将连续数据和离散事件视为独立过程，这限制了在复杂系统中对两者同步交互的建模能力。

Result: 在体育领域验证了该框架的有效性，实现了最先进的性能，并创建了包含文本描述的统一样准数据集。

Conclusion: 联合建模对于构建真实且可控的交互系统生成模型至关重要。

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate
processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact
synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion
framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating
continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate
its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent
trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with
non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios:
weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game
dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance,
which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the
conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective
conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified
sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football
datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that
joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative
models for interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型EEG模型主要关注编码器架构，缺乏同等能力的解码器，限制了学习特征的充分利用。需要一种能够更好利用学习特征并适应多样化任务的模型架构。

Method: ECHO采用序列到序列学习范式，在序列空间中捕捉信号、标签和任务的层次关系，并整合离散支持样本构建上下文线索，赋予模型上下文学习能力。

Conclusion: ECHO通过解码器中心的序列到序列学习范式，成功解决了传统LEM模型解码能力不足的问题，为EEG建模提供了更灵活和强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), with its broad range of applications,
necessitates models that can generalize effectively across various tasks and
datasets. Large EEG Models (LEMs) address this by pretraining encoder-centric
architectures on large-scale unlabeled data to extract universal
representations. While effective, these models lack decoders of comparable
capacity, limiting the full utilization of the learned features. To address
this issue, we introduce ECHO, a novel decoder-centric LEM paradigm that
reformulates EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning. ECHO captures
layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space,
while incorporating discrete support samples to construct contextual cues. This
design equips ECHO with in-context learning, enabling dynamic adaptation to
heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that, even with basic model components, ECHO
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task
settings, showing superior generalization and adaptability.

Conclusion: GCN框架在捆绑定价问题中表现出色，能够高效处理大规模复杂实例，为解决组合优化问题提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Bundle pricing refers to designing several product combinations (i.e.,
bundles) and determining their prices in order to maximize the expected profit.
It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries,
such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typically
intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper,
we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the
bundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation
of the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a
specific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal
bundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to
derive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further
proposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN
trained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve
near-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational
time for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions
for larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as
bundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions
for instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where
product utilities are non-additive.

*Lute Lillo,Nick Cheney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 激活函数选择是缓解持续学习中可塑性损失的关键因素，作者提出了两种新的非线性激活函数（Smooth-Leaky和Randomized Smooth-Leaky），在监督学习和强化学习的持续学习场景中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习中，模型不仅面临灾难性遗忘问题，还会逐渐失去适应能力（可塑性损失），而激活函数在这种失效模式中的作用尚未得到充分探索。作者旨在研究激活函数如何影响持续学习中的可塑性保持。

Method: 基于对负分支形状和饱和行为的属性级分析，引入了两种即插即用的非线性激活函数（Smooth-Leaky和Randomized Smooth-Leaky），并在监督类增量基准和非平稳MuJoCo环境的强化学习中进行评估。

Result: 研究表明，经过深思熟虑的激活函数设计能够在不增加额外容量或任务特定调整的情况下，为持续学习提供轻量级、领域通用的可塑性保持方法。

Conclusion: 激活函数选择是缓解持续学习中可塑性损失的主要架构无关杠杆，为持续学习提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation
functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink
once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the
picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively
lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of
the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that
activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating
plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape
and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky
and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings:
(i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning
with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled
distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and
diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under
change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a
lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning
without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督方法，将高维策略参数空间压缩到低维潜在空间，通过行为重建损失训练生成模型，使潜在空间按功能相似性而非参数邻近性组织。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习样本效率低，特别是在多任务设置中，这源于直接在高维冗余参数空间中优化策略。

Method: 训练生成模型将策略参数空间压缩到低维潜在空间，使用行为重建损失确保潜在空间按功能相似性组织。

Result: 在连续控制领域验证，标准策略网络的参数化可压缩达五个数量级，同时保留大部分表达能力。

Conclusion: 学习的流形支持在潜在空间中进行策略梯度的任务特定适应，证明了环境复杂性而非网络大小决定内在维度。

Abstract: Despite its recent successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is
notoriously sample-inefficient. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the
standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and
highly redundant parameter space $\Theta$. This challenge is greatly compounded
in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach
that compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensional
latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model
$g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which
ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than
proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality
of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the
size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control
domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be
compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its
expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables
task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space
$\mathcal{Z}$.

Motivation: 捷克东北部是地震活跃区，既有构造地震也有采矿诱发地震，虽然采矿活动已停止但诱发地震仍会发生。快速区分不同类型地震事件对于地震监测和灾害评估具有重要意义。

Method: 应用机器学习方法（长短期记忆循环神经网络和XGBoost）对SPF数据集进行二元分类，该数据集包含标记的构造地震和采矿诱发地震记录。

Abstract: The northeastern region of the Czech Republic is among the most seismically
active areas in the country. The most frequent seismic events are
mining-induced since there used to be strong mining activity in the past.
However, natural tectonic events may also occur. In addition, seismic stations
often record explosions in quarries in the region. Despite the cessation of
mining activities, mine-induced seismic events still occur. Therefore, a rapid
differentiation between tectonic and anthropogenic events is still important.
  The region is currently monitored by the OKC seismic station in
Ostrava-Kr\'{a}sn\'{e} Pole built in 1983 which is a part of the Czech Regional
Seismic Network. The station has been providing digital continuous waveform
data at 100 Hz since 2007. In the years 1992--2002, the region was co-monitored
by the Seismic Polygon Fren\v{s}t\'{a}t (SPF) which consisted of five seismic
stations using a triggered STA/LTA system.
  In this study, we apply and compare machine learning methods to the SPF
dataset, which contains labeled records of tectonic and mining-induced events.
For binary classification, a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network
and XGBoost achieved an F1-score of 0.94 -- 0.95, demonstrating the potential
of modern machine learning techniques for rapid event characterization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮稀疏奖励环境中，智能体面临探索-利用级联失败：早期策略过早收敛到低熵策略，后期熵正则化反而导致策略崩溃和混沌探索。

Method: EPO框架包含三个机制：(1)多轮环境中的熵正则化增强探索；(2)熵平滑正则化器限制策略熵在历史平均值范围内；(3)自适应阶段权重平衡训练中的探索与利用。

Result: EPO在ScienceWorld上实现最高152%的性能提升，在ALFWorld上实现19.8%的性能提升，证明其能有效解决多轮稀疏奖励环境中的训练问题。

Conclusion: 多轮稀疏奖励环境需要与传统RL不同的熵控制方法，EPO通过系统性的熵管理机制成功解决了探索-利用级联失败问题。

Abstract: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where
completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode,
presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a
critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation
cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature
convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,
low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,
where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting
chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized
Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle
through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in
multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing
regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent
abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances
exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO
guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining
convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld
and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn
sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than
traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

TL;DR: 论文提出EDGE评估协议，通过识别极端类别序列来更准确地评估类增量学习的性能分布，解决传统采样方法低估性能方差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIL评估协议仅从少量随机序列计算均值和方差，无法捕捉完整性能范围，导致有偏估计和方差严重低估。需要能准确表征整个性能分布的鲁棒评估方法。

Method: 提出EDGE评估协议：1）引入极端序列概念；2）利用任务间相似性与性能的正相关性指导搜索极端序列；3）自适应采样极端类别序列来逼近真实性能分布。

Result: 实验表明EDGE能有效捕捉性能极值，更准确地估计分布边界，为模型选择和鲁棒性检查提供可行见解。

Conclusion: 基于任务间相似性识别极端序列的EDGE协议能提供更可靠的CIL评估，更好地反映模型在不同类别序列下的真实性能分布。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new
classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable
performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the
order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model
performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream
evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of
randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results
demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance
range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the
true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a
robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the
entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of
extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role
in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive
correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation
that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on
these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and
Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies
and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a
closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and
yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing
actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流匹配生成模型虽然效果优异，但推理速度慢，需要多步采样。Mean Flow虽然能实现单步生成，但在许多连续域中无法准确近似原始多步流匹配过程的行为。

Method: 将最优传输采样策略整合到Mean Flow框架中，使单步生成器能够更好地保持原始多步流过程的保真度和多样性。

Result: 在低维控制设置和高维任务（如图像生成、图像到图像转换、点云生成）上的实验表明，该方法在单步生成建模中实现了更优的推理精度。

Conclusion: 通过结合最优传输策略，提出的方法在保持流匹配模型生成质量的同时，显著提升了单步生成的推理效率。

Abstract: Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains
such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these
models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential
sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the
number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation
approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative
performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully
approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In
this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based
sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators
that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow
process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on
high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation,
and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic
tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,
yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but
such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to
the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive
exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own
experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway
divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)
recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a
replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy
update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range
of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum
to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster
skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.
At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the
accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar
distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As
training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing
successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level
exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.
To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in
the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such
as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and
advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb
over-confidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练中存在熵崩溃和熵爆炸的振荡问题，这源于无价值RL中使用的均值基线在奖励异常值情况下对负优势样本的不当惩罚。

Method: 提出QAE方法，用分组K分位数基线替代均值基线，在困难查询中强化罕见成功，在简单查询中针对剩余失败，实现响应级别的双机制门控。

Result: QAE稳定了熵，稀疏化了信用分配（约80%响应获得零优势），在Qwen3-8B/14B-Base模型上对AIME 2024/2025和AMC 2023任务实现了持续的pass@1提升。

Conclusion: 基线设计（而非token级启发式）是扩展RLVR的主要机制，QAE通过最小修改实现了训练稳定性和性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM
reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and
{entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in
value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes
negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile
Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile
baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <=
1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it
targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove
{two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy
change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal
modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K,
roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1
gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results
identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the
primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.

Motivation: ICL在数据稀缺环境下比SFT具有更好的泛化性和校准响应，但推理计算成本更高。研究能否利用ICL的内部计算来改进SFT的质量。

Method: 首先展示ICL和SFT产生不同的激活模式，然后引入ICL激活对齐(IA2)自蒸馏技术，在SFT前作为预训练步骤，激励模型进行ICL式的内部推理。

Result: 在12个流行基准测试和2个模型家族上的广泛实证结果显示，IA2显著提高了模型输出的准确性和校准性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅具有实际应用价值，还为理解模型适应的内部机制提供了概念窗口。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training
weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast,
In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or
demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more
calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of
more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal
computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL
and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods
achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this
observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation
Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's
activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.
Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy
and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results
on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only
practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner
mechanics of model adaptation.

Abstract: We provide a theoretical analysis for end-to-end training Discrete Flow
Matching (DFM) generative models. DFM is a promising discrete generative
modeling framework that learns the underlying generative dynamics by training a
neural network to approximate the transformative velocity field. Our analysis
establishes a clear chain of guarantees by decomposing the final distribution
estimation error. We first prove that the total variation distance between the
generated and target distributions is controlled by the risk of the learned
velocity field. We then bound this risk by analyzing its two primary sources:
(i) Approximation Error, where we quantify the capacity of the Transformer
architecture to represent the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error, where
we derive statistical convergence rates that bound the error from training on a
finite dataset. By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof
that the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to
the true data distribution as the training set size increases.

Abstract: Heuristic functions are central to the performance of search algorithms such
as A-star, where admissibility - the property of never overestimating the true
shortest-path cost - guarantees solution optimality. Recent deep learning
approaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on
generalization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these
limitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization
problem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that
enforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method
yields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than
compressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the
sample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and
the structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the
bound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize.
Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds
that depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph
size. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization
guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.

Abstract: Bilateral trade models the task of intermediating between two strategic
agents, a seller and a buyer, willing to trade a good for which they hold
private valuations. We study this problem from the perspective of a broker, in
a regret minimization framework. At each time step, a new seller and buyer
arrive, and the broker has to propose a mechanism that is incentive-compatible
and individually rational, with the goal of maximizing profit.
  We propose a learning algorithm that guarantees a nearly tight
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the stochastic setting when seller and buyer
valuations are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed and possibly correlated unknown
distribution. We further show that it is impossible to achieve sublinear regret
in the non-stationary scenario where valuations are generated upfront by an
adversary. Our ambitious benchmark for these results is the best
incentive-compatible and individually rational mechanism. This separates us
from previous works on efficiency maximization in bilateral trade, where the
benchmark is a single number: the best fixed price in hindsight.
  A particular challenge we face is that uniform convergence for all
mechanisms' profits is impossible. We overcome this difficulty via a careful
chaining analysis that proves convergence for a provably near-optimal mechanism
at (essentially) optimal rate. We further showcase the broader applicability of
our techniques by providing nearly optimal results for the joint ads problem.

Motivation: 程序验证依赖循环不变式，但自动发现强不变式仍是长期挑战，需要建立原则性框架来评估LLMs在此任务上的表现。

Method: 使用基于验证器的决策过程，具有形式化正确性保证，评估不变式的正确性和验证加速效果。采用监督微调和Best-of-N采样技术提升性能。

Result: LLM验证器相比UAutomizer尚无显著优势，模型能力是关键因素。监督微调使Qwen3-Coder-480B的加速案例从8%提升到29.2%，Best-of-N采样使Claude-sonnet-4从8.8%提升到22.1%。

Conclusion: LLM验证器是有前景的方向但尚未超越传统方法，当前基准对LLMs仍是开放挑战，监督微调和采样技术能有效提升性能。

Abstract: Program verification relies on loop invariants, yet automatically discovering
strong invariants remains a long-standing challenge. We introduce a principled
framework for evaluating LLMs on invariant synthesis. Our approach uses a
verifier-based decision procedure with a formal soundness guarantee and
assesses not only correctness but also the speedup that invariants provide in
verification. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, and existing LLM-based
verifiers against the traditional solver UAutomizer. While LLM-based verifiers
represent a promising direction, they do not yet offer a significant advantage
over UAutomizer. Model capability also proves critical, as shown by sharp
differences in speedups across models, and our benchmark remains an open
challenge for current LLMs. Finally, we show that supervised fine-tuning and

Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs) promise faster materials discovery by coupling
automation with machine learning, but a central challenge is predicting costly,
slow-to-measure properties from inexpensive, automatable readouts. We address
this for doped conjugated polymers by learning interpretable spectral
fingerprints from optical spectroscopy to predict electrical conductivity.
Optical spectra are fast, non-destructive, and sensitive to aggregation and
charge generation; we automate their featurization by combining a genetic
algorithm (GA) with area-under-the-curve (AUC) computations over adaptively
selected spectral windows. These data-driven spectral features, together with
processing parameters, are used to train a quantitative structure-property
relationship (QSPR) linking optical response and processing to conductivity. To
improve accuracy and interpretability in the small-data regime, we add
domain-knowledge-based feature expansions and apply SHAP-guided selection to
retain a compact, physically meaningful feature set. The pipeline is evaluated
under a leak-free train/test protocol, and GA is repeated to assess feature
stability. The data-driven model matches the performance of a baseline built
from expert-curated descriptors while reducing experimental effort (about 33%)
by limiting direct conductivity measurements. Combining data-driven and expert
features yields a hybrid QSPR with superior predictive performance,
highlighting productive human-ML collaboration. The learned features recover
known descriptors in pBTTT (0-0/0-1 vibronic intensity ratio) and reveal a
tail-state region correlated with polymer bleaching during successful doping.
This approach delivers interpretable, noise-robust, small-data-friendly
features that convert rapid measurements into reliable predictions of costly
properties and readily extends to other spectral modalities (e.g., XANES,
Raman, FTIR).

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 开发了一个自动化机器学习管道(AMLP)，用于简化机器学习原子间势(MLIPs)的开发流程，从数据集创建到模型验证实现全流程自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发可靠的MLIPs仍然困难，需要生成高质量数据集、预处理原子结构、仔细训练和验证模型，因此需要一个统一的工作流程来简化整个过程。

Method: 引入自动化机器学习管道(AMLP)，使用大语言模型代理协助电子结构代码选择、输入准备和输出转换，基于ASE的分析套件支持分子模拟，采用MACE架构。

Result: 在吖啶多晶型物上验证，通过基础模型的简单微调，实现了能量误差约1.7 meV/原子和力误差约7.0 meV/Å，MLIP能够以亚Å精度重现DFT几何结构，并在微正则和正则系综的分子动力学模拟中表现出稳定性。

Conclusion: AMLP提供了一个高效可靠的MLIP开发解决方案，显著简化了工作流程，实现了接近量子精度的性能，为分子模拟提供了强大的工具。

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become powerful tools to
extend molecular simulations beyond the limits of quantum methods, offering
near-quantum accuracy at much lower computational cost. Yet, developing
reliable MLIPs remains difficult because it requires generating high-quality
datasets, preprocessing atomic structures, and carefully training and
validating models. In this work, we introduce an Automated Machine Learning
Pipeline (AMLP) that unifies the entire workflow from dataset creation to model
validation. AMLP employs large-language-model agents to assist with
electronic-structure code selection, input preparation, and output conversion,
while its analysis suite (AMLP-Analysis), based on ASE supports a range of
molecular simulations. The pipeline is built on the MACE architecture and
validated on acridine polymorphs, where, with a straightforward fine-tuning of
a foundation model, mean absolute errors of ~1.7 meV/atom in energies and ~7.0
meV/{\AA} in forces are achieved. The fitted MLIP reproduces DFT geometries
with sub-{\AA} accuracy and demonstrates stability during molecular dynamics
simulations in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仪器开发中的测试阶段（特别是探测器表征和参数优化）已成为主要瓶颈，传统方法需要专家投入一年以上的时间进行设备特性分析和最优参数寻找。

Method: 采用闭环贝叶斯优化(BO)技术，利用实时测量数据指导参数选择，自动识别传感器的最佳工作状态。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了仪器开发周期中测试阶段的瓶颈问题，大幅提升了传感器校准和优化的效率。

Abstract: The development of novel instrumentation requires an iterative cycle with
three stages: design, prototyping, and testing. Recent advancements in
simulation and nanofabrication techniques have significantly accelerated the
design and prototyping phases. Nonetheless, detector characterization continues
to be a major bottleneck in device development. During the testing phase, a
significant time investment is required to characterize the device in different
operating conditions and find optimal operating parameters. The total effort
spent on characterization and parameter optimization can occupy a year or more
of an expert's time. In this work, we present a novel technique for automated
sensor calibration that aims to accelerate the testing stage of the development
cycle. This technique leverages closed-loop Bayesian optimization (BO), using
real-time measurements to guide parameter selection and identify optimal
operating states. We demonstrate the method with a novel low-noise CCD, showing
that the machine learning-driven tool can efficiently characterize and optimize
operation of the sensor in a couple of days without supervision of a device
expert.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多物体场景中稳定放置物体是机器人操作的基本挑战，现有方法依赖仿真引擎或启发式评估，需要更高效准确的稳定性评估方法

Method: 使用离线采样规划器收集多模态放置标签，训练条件扩散模型生成稳定放置，结合基于分数的生成模型组合性和稳定性感知损失

Result: 在四个基准场景中，物理引导模型实现的放置对强力扰动的鲁棒性提高56%，运行时间减少47%

Conclusion: 该方法成功将物理稳定性直接集成到生成模型中，无需额外训练即可显著提升放置稳定性和效率

Abstract: Stably placing an object in a multi-object scene is a fundamental challenge
in robotic manipulation, as placements must be penetration-free, establish
precise surface contact, and result in a force equilibrium. To assess
stability, existing methods rely on running a simulation engine or resort to
heuristic, appearance-based assessments. In contrast, our approach integrates
stability directly into the sampling process of a diffusion model. To this end,
we query an offline sampling-based planner to gather multi-modal placement
labels and train a diffusion model to generate stable placements. The diffusion
model is conditioned on scene and object point clouds, and serves as a
geometry-aware prior. We leverage the compositional nature of score-based
generative models to combine this learned prior with a stability-aware loss,
thereby increasing the likelihood of sampling from regions of high stability.
Importantly, this strategy requires no additional re-training or fine-tuning,
and can be directly applied to off-the-shelf models. We evaluate our method on
four benchmark scenes where stability can be accurately computed. Our
physics-guided models achieve placements that are 56% more robust to forceful
perturbations while reducing runtime by 47% compared to a state-of-the-art
geometric method.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出可学习一致性预测（LCP）方法，通过轻量级神经网络生成上下文感知的不确定性集合，在保持理论保证的同时显著减小预测集大小，提高机器人任务的安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在机器人应用中输出点估计且置信度校准不佳，缺乏量化预测可靠性的机制。传统一致性预测依赖固定非一致性分数，忽略了上下文信息，导致区间过于保守或不安全。

Method: 使用轻量级神经网络函数替代固定非一致性分数，利用几何、语义和任务特定特征生成上下文感知的不确定性集合，保持一致性预测的理论保证。

Result: 在分类任务中预测集大小减少18%，检测区间缩小52%，路径规划安全性从72%提升至91%。在7个基准测试中持续优于标准CP和集成方法，运行时开销仅4.8%，内存占用42KB。

Conclusion: LCP是一种轻量级、高效的方法，适用于资源受限的自主系统，在保持理论保证的同时显著提升预测精度和任务安全性。

Abstract: Deep learning models in robotics often output point estimates with poorly
calibrated confidences, offering no native mechanism to quantify predictive
reliability under novel, noisy, or out-of-distribution inputs. Conformal
prediction (CP) addresses this gap by providing distribution-free coverage
guarantees, yet its reliance on fixed nonconformity scores ignores context and
can yield intervals that are overly conservative or unsafe. We address this
with Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP), which replaces fixed scores with a
lightweight neural function that leverages geometric, semantic, and
task-specific features to produce context-aware uncertainty sets.
  LCP maintains CP's theoretical guarantees while reducing prediction set sizes
by 18% in classification, tightening detection intervals by 52%, and improving
path planning safety from 72% to 91% success with minimal overhead. Across
three robotic tasks on seven benchmarks, LCP consistently outperforms Standard
CP and ensemble baselines. In classification on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, it
achieves smaller set sizes (4.7-9.9% reduction) at target coverage. For object
detection on COCO, BDD100K, and Cityscapes, it produces 46-54% tighter bounding
boxes. In path planning through cluttered environments, it improves success to
91.5% with only 4.5% path inflation, compared to 12.2% for Standard CP.
  The method is lightweight (approximately 4.8% runtime overhead, 42 KB memory)
and supports online adaptation, making it well suited to resource-constrained
autonomous systems. Hardware evaluation shows LCP adds less than 1% memory and
15.9% inference overhead, yet sustains 39 FPS on detection tasks while being
7.4 times more energy-efficient than ensembles.

TL;DR: FlowDrive是一个基于流匹配的轨迹规划器，通过条件修正流将噪声直接映射到轨迹分布，并使用调节引导机制增加轨迹多样性，在nuPlan和interPlan基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决学习型规划器对驾驶数据长尾分布的敏感性问题，常见操作在数据集中占主导，而危险或罕见场景稀疏，这种不平衡会导致模型偏向频繁情况，在关键场景上性能下降。

Method: 提出FlowDrive，一个流匹配轨迹规划器，学习条件修正流以少量流匹配步骤将噪声直接映射到轨迹分布；引入调节的循环内引导，在流步骤之间注入小扰动来系统性地增加轨迹多样性，同时保持场景一致性。

Result: 在nuPlan和交互重点的interPlan基准测试中，FlowDrive在学习型规划器中达到最先进结果，接近基于规则优化的方法。添加调节引导和轻量后处理后，在几乎所有基准测试分割中都实现了整体最先进性能。

Conclusion: FlowDrive通过流匹配和调节引导有效解决了数据不平衡问题，在轨迹规划任务中表现出色，证明了该方法在处理长尾分布和提升关键场景性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Learning-based planners are sensitive to the long-tailed distribution of
driving data. Common maneuvers dominate datasets, while dangerous or rare
scenarios are sparse. This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases
and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we
compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by
trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a
flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to
map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We
further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small
perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity
while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused
interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among
learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements.
After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it
achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark
splits.

Motivation: 现有基于VLM的方法将动作预测视为文本生成任务，但作者认为航空视觉语言导航的动作预测更适合作为2D空间定位任务来处理。

Method: 利用VLM将模糊语言指令分解为输入图像上的迭代2D路径点标注，结合预测的行驶距离，将2D路径点转换为3D位移向量作为无人机动作命令，并自适应调整行驶距离以提高导航效率。

Result: 在DRL仿真基准测试中创造了新的最先进水平，比之前最佳方法绝对提升了63%。在真实世界评估中大幅超越强基线方法，且对不同VLM表现出显著泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPF框架通过将动作预测重新定义为2D空间定位任务，实现了无需训练的高效航空视觉语言导航，在仿真和真实环境中都表现出色，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language
navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is
capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions
in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that
treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to
consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF
harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative
annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted
traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement
vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the
traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF
performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow
dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL
simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute
margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong
baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to
highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable
generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多模态行为分析的自闭症谱系障碍（ASC）计算机辅助诊断方法，通过整合面部表情、声音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性和注视行为等特征，提高了诊断准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自闭症谱系障碍诊断过程复杂且资源密集，现有计算机辅助诊断方法在注视特征性能不佳和缺乏现实世界泛化能力方面存在局限，需要开发更有效的诊断支持工具。

Method: 使用包含168名ASC参与者（46%女性）和157名非自闭症参与者（46%女性）的标准化视频数据集，进行多模态行为分析。针对注视模型局限性，引入了量化眼球注视角度变异性的新型统计描述符，并采用后期融合方法整合各模态特征。

Result: 新型注视描述符将基于注视的分类准确率从64%提升至69%，与临床研究中关于ASC注视回避的发现一致。通过后期融合方法，整体分类准确率达到74%，证明了多模态行为标记整合的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明基于视频的筛查工具在支持自闭症评估方面具有可扩展的潜力，多模态行为分析能够有效提高诊断准确性。

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

TL;DR: LongiMam是一个端到端的深度学习模型，整合当前和最多四个既往乳腺X光片，通过卷积神经网络和循环神经网络结合空间和时间模式来预测乳腺癌风险，在真实世界不平衡数据中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数深度学习模型仅使用单次或有限次数的既往乳腺X光片，缺乏对真实世界不平衡结果分布和异质性随访的适应性。

Method: 开发LongiMam模型，结合卷积神经网络和循环神经网络，整合当前和最多四个既往乳腺X光片，捕捉预测乳腺癌的空间和时间模式。

Result: 在多种包含不同数量和组成的既往检查场景中，LongiMam在加入既往乳腺X光片后持续改善预测性能。结合既往和当前访问优于单次访问模型，而仅使用既往检查效果较差。在关键风险群体（包括致密乳腺和55岁以上女性）中均有效，在乳腺密度随时间变化的女性中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 纵向建模增强乳腺癌预测能力，支持在筛查项目中使用重复乳腺X光片来改进风险分层。LongiMam已作为开源软件公开提供。

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的调试框架，通过移除和重新训练两个步骤来修复概念瓶颈模型中的系统性偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型的干预方法无法解决模型与专家推理之间的系统性偏差问题，比如模型从有偏数据中学习捷径。

Method: 采用移除和重新训练两步骤：移除步骤中专家识别并删除不期望的概念；重新训练步骤使用CBDebug方法将概念级用户反馈转化为样本级辅助标签，应用监督偏差缓解和针对性增强。

Result: CBDebug在多个CBM架构（PIP-Net、Post-hoc CBM）和具有已知虚假相关性的基准测试中显著优于先前的重新训练方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效减少了模型对不期望概念的依赖，提高了概念瓶颈模型的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于幅度的剪枝如何影响神经网络的可解释性，发现适度剪枝能改善注意力图的聚焦性和忠实度，而过度剪枝会降低概念一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明神经网络可以大幅剪枝而不损失性能，但剪枝对模型可解释性的影响尚不明确，需要系统研究剪枝如何改变模型的解释性特征。

Method: 使用在ImageNette上训练的ResNet-18，比较不同剪枝程度下Vanilla Gradients和Integrated Gradients的解释结果，评估稀疏性和忠实度，并应用CRAFT方法提取概念表示。

Result: 轻到中度剪枝改善了注意力图的聚焦性和忠实度，同时保持了语义明确的概念；而激进剪枝会合并异质特征，降低注意力图稀疏性和概念一致性，尽管准确率得以保持。

Conclusion: 剪枝可以塑造内部表征使其更符合人类注意力模式，但过度剪枝会损害可解释性，需要在性能和可解释性之间找到平衡。

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

TL;DR: 使用单图像超分辨率模型将气候预测从低分辨率（12.5公里）统计降尺度到高分辨率（1公里），通过基于气候指标的评估方法验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有气候预测空间分辨率低（12.5公里），限制了其在地方决策中的可用性，需要开发高分辨率气候预测方法。

Method: 在观测网格数据集上训练单图像超分辨率模型，然后应用于低分辨率气候预测；提出基于气候指标的评估方法，使用气象站观测数据计算气候指数来评估降尺度结果。

Result: 对日平均温度的实验表明，单图像超分辨率模型能够降尺度气候预测，且不会增加气候指标的误差。

Conclusion: 单图像超分辨率模型可以有效提升气候预测的空间分辨率，为地方决策提供更精细的气候信息。

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyME是一个按需概念擦除框架，通过训练轻量级LoRA适配器并动态组合来实现灵活的多概念擦除，解决了现有静态擦除方法在多概念场景下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型会无意中复制受版权保护的风格和视觉概念，引发法律和伦理问题。现有概念擦除方法无法扩展到需要擦除多个可能冲突概念的实用场景。

Method: 提出DyME框架：训练概念特定的LoRA适配器，在推理时动态组合所需适配器；引入双层正交性约束（特征级和参数级）来解决适配器间的干扰问题。

Result: 在ErasureBench-H和标准数据集上的实验表明，DyME持续优于现有最先进基线，实现了更高的多概念擦除保真度和最小的附带退化。

Conclusion: DyME通过模块化设计和正交性约束，有效解决了多概念擦除中的干扰问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted
styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher
multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LSEP正则化方法，通过促进中间层表示的线性可分性来改进扩散模型的训练，无需外部编码器和对齐，在SiT架构上实现了1.46的FID分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于表示对齐的方法依赖计算成本高昂的大型预训练编码器，需要寻找更高效的训练策略来改进扩散模型的判别特征表示。

Method: 提出LSEP正则化方法，将线性可分性直接融入网络学习动态，无需外部编码器和对齐操作。

Result: 在基于流的Transformer架构（如SiT）上实现了显著的训练效率提升和生成质量改进，在256×256 ImageNet数据集上达到1.46 FID。

Conclusion: LSEP方法有效替代了表示对齐方法，无需依赖外部编码器，同时将线性探测直接整合到学习过程中，提高了训练效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从单张图像预测物体运动轨迹的方法，通过生成密集轨迹网格而非像素来直接建模运动，相比现有视频生成器在运动预测方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成器虽然被视为世界模型，但在从单张图像预测运动方面表现不佳，特别是在简单物理场景中。这是因为生成像素的额外开销限制了直接建模运动的能力。

Method: 将运动预测任务构建为条件生成密集轨迹网格的问题，采用现代视频生成器的架构但输出运动轨迹而非像素，从而直接捕捉场景范围内的动态和不确定性。

Result: 该方法在模拟数据上表现优异，在机器人等下游应用中有效，在真实世界直观物理数据集上显示出有前景的准确性，比先前的回归器和生成器产生更准确和多样化的预测。

Conclusion: 直接建模运动轨迹而非生成像素的方法能更有效地从单张图像预测物体运动，克服了现有视频生成器在运动预测方面的局限性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统灾害评估方法缓慢危险，现有计算机视觉方法只能提供分类标签或分割掩码，无法提供全面的情境理解。

Method: 采用双架构方法：CNN-LSTM模型用于卫星图像，Vision Transformer模型用于无人机图像，结合ConceptNet和WordNet的外部语义知识扩展词汇覆盖并提高描述准确性。

Result: VLCE在InfoMetIC指标上达到最高95.33%，同时保持有竞争力的语义对齐，显著优于LLaVA和QwenVL等基线模型。

Conclusion: 双架构系统在通过自动化生成可操作、信息密集的描述来改进灾害损害评估方面显示出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing
CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness.
Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production
of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

TL;DR: MORPH是一个形状无关的自回归基础模型，用于处理偏微分方程(PDEs)，能够处理不同维度(1D-3D)、分辨率和物理场的异构时空数据集，在多个下游预测任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决科学机器学习中处理异构、多模态数据的挑战，开发一个能够无缝处理不同维度、分辨率和物理场的灵活基础模型。

Method: 基于卷积视觉Transformer架构，结合组件卷积处理标量和矢量通道，跨场交叉注意力建模不同物理场间信息，轴向注意力分解时空自注意力以降低计算负担。

Result: 在多个PDE数据集上预训练后，通过全模型微调和LoRA适配器，MORPH在零样本和全样本泛化中均优于从头训练的模型，达到或超过现有最佳模型性能。

Conclusion: MORPH为从异构和多模态科学观测中学习提供了灵活强大的骨干网络，为可扩展和数据高效的科学机器学习开辟了道路。

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

TL;DR: UISim是一个基于图像的UI模拟器，通过两阶段方法从屏幕图像预测和生成新的UI状态，为移动界面测试和AI代理训练提供动态交互平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖物理设备或静态截图分析，难以应对现实移动环境的动态多样性，限制了可扩展测试和智能UI代理的开发。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：给定初始屏幕图像和用户操作，首先预测下一个UI状态的抽象布局，然后基于预测布局合成视觉一致的新图像。

Result: 实验显示UISim在生成真实连贯的后续UI状态方面优于端到端UI生成基线方法，证明了其保真度和实用性。

Conclusion: UISim为UI测试、快速原型设计和合成数据生成提供了实际价值，其交互能力为AI代理的UI导航任务规划等高级应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种保持空间完整性的token合并方法，解决了现代ViT架构中空间设计对token缩减的挑战，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代ViT骨干网络采用空间架构设计（如窗口注意力、相对位置编码等），现有token缩减方法无法保持这些架构所依赖的空间结构，导致兼容性问题。

Method: 采用2D缩减策略保持结构化token布局，空间感知合并算法维持相对token位置，以及新颖的每维度最大幅度token表示来保留显著特征。

Result: 在SAM-H上实现1.25倍加速，仅0.7% mIOU下降；在DeiT-B上实现1.15倍加速，ImageNet top-1准确率无损失。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能够与空间架构无缝兼容，在各种视觉任务上达到最先进性能，既支持即插即用也支持微调使用。

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERGO提出了一种从粗到精的推理框架，通过两阶段处理高分辨率图像：首先分析下采样图像识别任务相关区域，然后仅对这些区域进行全分辨率裁剪处理，从而在保持细粒度视觉细节的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致计算开销巨大。随着'图像思维'模型的出现，推理能力扩展到视觉领域，这促使开发更高效的推理方法。

Method: 采用两阶段'从粗到精'推理流程：第一阶段分析下采样图像识别任务相关区域；第二阶段仅对相关区域进行全分辨率裁剪处理。通过强化学习框架开发奖励组件，实现推理驱动的感知，能够考虑感知不确定性并扩展裁剪区域覆盖视觉模糊区域。

Result: 在多个数据集上，ERGO比原始模型和竞争方法获得更高准确率且效率更高。例如，在V*基准测试中超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B 4.7分，仅使用23%的视觉token，实现3倍推理加速。

Conclusion: ERGO通过推理驱动的感知方法，在保持准确性的同时显著提高了高分辨率图像处理的效率，为现实世界视觉语言应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

Motivation: 旨在提升GAN生成图像的潜在空间效率和可控性，通过结合多种技术实现更高效、直观的图像编辑。

Method: 将StyleGAN的结构化潜在空间、DragGAN的直观图像操作与PCA降维技术结合，在AFHQ数据集上进行实验，特别在W+层引入PCA。

Result: PCA能显著减少总优化时间，同时保持良好视觉质量，在浅层潜在空间（W+层=3）中甚至能提升SSIM指标。成功实现了AFHQ-Dog和AFHQ-Cat两个相似但不同数据域的模型对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法为广泛的图像合成和编辑应用提供了高效且可解释的潜在空间控制可能性。

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动量的采样技术HiGS，通过整合历史预测信息来提升扩散模型采样质量和效率，无需额外训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了显著进展，但在使用较少神经函数评估次数或较低引导尺度时，输出仍可能显得不真实且缺乏细节。

Method: HiGS利用当前预测与过去预测加权平均之间的差异来引导采样过程，向更真实的输出和更好的细节结构方向发展。

Result: 实验表明HiGS在不同模型和架构下都能持续提升图像质量，使用预训练SiT模型在ImageNet 256×256无引导生成中仅用30步就达到了1.61的FID新记录。

Conclusion: HiGS作为一种即插即用的增强技术，能够实现更快速度、更高保真度的扩散采样。

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARK框架通过协同进化策略和奖励模型，在RLVR基础上回收丢弃的轨迹和正确性数据，让模型自我训练作为生成式奖励模型，无需单独奖励模型和人类偏好数据，实现高效稳定的强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF成本高和奖励-策略不匹配问题，以及RLVR浪费监督信号的问题，提出更高效的强化学习方法。

Method: 在RLVR基础上回收轨迹和正确性数据，同时训练模型作为生成式奖励模型，使用点式奖励评分、成对比较和反思条件评估等混合目标。

Result: SPARK-VL-7B在7个推理基准上平均提升9.7%，2个奖励基准上提升12.1%，8个通用基准上提升1.5%，表现出鲁棒性和广泛泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPARK框架通过策略和奖励模型的协同进化，实现了无需外部奖励模型的高效强化学习，在多个基准上取得显著性能提升。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIPSY提出了一种无需训练的小样本图像分类方法，利用IP-Adapter进行图像到图像转换，通过正负图像条件独立控制和类相似性采样策略生成判别性合成图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小样本图像分类中标记样本有限的问题，避免现有方法需要模型微调或外部信息源的依赖。

Method: 使用IP-Adapter进行图像到图像转换，引入扩展的无分类器引导方案实现正负图像条件独立控制，采用类相似性采样策略选择对比样本，构建无需模型微调或外部工具的简单流程。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到或接近最先进性能，无需生成模型适应或依赖外部工具进行标题生成和图像过滤。

Conclusion: 利用正负引导的双重图像提示生成类判别特征的方法特别适用于细粒度分类任务，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

Motivation: 重新审视VAR模型，发现其与扩散模型的理论联系，旨在结合两者的优势来改进视觉生成。

Method: 通过马尔可夫注意力掩码使VAR等价于离散扩散，建立SRDD框架，引入扩散模型的迭代优化特性。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了SRDD能实现更快的收敛、更低的推理成本和更好的零样本重建效果。

Conclusion: 扩散模型的视角为VAR带来了效率和生成质量的一致提升，建立了自回归变换器与扩散模型之间的理论桥梁。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

Abstract: The properties of complexes with transuranium elements have long been the
object of research in various fields of chemistry. However, their experimental
study is complicated by their rarity, high cost and special conditions
necessary for working with such elements, and the complexity of quantum
chemical calculations does not allow their use for large systems. To overcome
these problems, we used modern machine learning methods to create a novel
neural network architecture that allows to use available experimental data on a

models. We also described the applicability domain of the presented model and
identified the molecular fragments that most influence the stability of the
complexes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将遗憾最小化算法的理论保证扩展到定点迭代问题，为寻找非自算子的定点提供新的简单迭代方法。

Method: 提出转换方案，将遗憾最小化算法转化为定点迭代，特别是从AdaGrad族算法转换得到具有自适应保证的新迭代方法。

Result: 数值实验表明，基于AdaGrad的定点迭代比Krasnoselskii-Mann迭代收敛更快。

Conclusion: 该转换方案成功将遗憾最小化算法转化为有效的定点迭代方法，为定点问题提供了新的求解工具。

Abstract: We propose a conversion scheme that turns regret minimizing algorithms into
fixed point iterations, with convergence guarantees following from regret
bounds. The resulting iterations can be seen as a grand extension of the
classical Krasnoselskii--Mann iterations, as the latter are recovered by
converting the Online Gradient Descent algorithm. This approach yields new
simple iterations for finding fixed points of non-self operators. We also focus
on converting algorithms from the AdaGrad family of regret minimizers, and thus
obtain fixed point iterations with adaptive guarantees of a new kind. Numerical
experiments on various problems demonstrate faster convergence of AdaGrad-based
fixed point iterations over Krasnoselskii--Mann iterations.

TL;DR: 本文评估了五种深度学习模型在野火蔓延预测中的表现，并与传统FARSITE模型进行比较，发现ConvLSTM及其注意力变体表现最佳，AI模型在数据灵活性方面有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术的快速发展，各种深度学习模型被用于野火蔓延预测，但缺乏对这些模型优势和局限性的理解，也不清楚如何将深度学习模型与现有非AI火灾模型进行比较。

Method: 使用夏威夷州超过十年的野火数据，评估了五种典型的深度学习模型（结合天气和环境变量）的野火蔓延预测能力，并以2023年毛伊岛火灾为案例，将最佳深度学习模型与广泛使用的FARSITE模型进行比较。

Result: ConvLSTM及其注意力变体在五个测试的AI模型中表现最佳。FARSITE显示出更高的精度、更低的召回率和更高的F1分数，而AI模型在输入数据方面提供更高的灵活性。通过可解释AI方法识别了与2023年毛伊岛野火相关的重要天气和环境因素。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型在野火蔓延预测中具有潜力，特别是在数据灵活性方面，而传统模型如FARSITE在某些性能指标上仍具优势，结合可解释AI方法可以识别关键影响因素。

Abstract: Predicting the spread of wildfires is essential for effective fire management
and risk assessment. With the fast advancements of artificial intelligence
(AI), various deep learning models have been developed and utilized for
wildfire spread prediction. However, there is limited understanding of the
advantages and limitations of these models, and it is also unclear how deep
learning-based fire spread models can be compared with existing non-AI fire
models. In this work, we assess the ability of five typical deep learning
models integrated with weather and environmental variables for wildfire spread
prediction based on over ten years of wildfire data in the state of Hawaii. We
further use the 2023 Maui fires as a case study to compare the best deep
learning models with a widely-used fire spread model, FARSITE. The results show
that two deep learning models, i.e., ConvLSTM and ConvLSTM with attention,
perform the best among the five tested AI models. FARSITE shows higher
precision, lower recall, and higher F1-score than the best AI models, while the
AI models offer higher flexibility for the input data. By integrating AI models
with an explainable AI method, we further identify important weather and
environmental factors associated with the 2023 Maui wildfires.

Method: 采用质性研究方法，对20名移动软件设计和开发从业者进行调查，使用in vivo编码分析收集的专家陈述数据。

Result: 开发了一个新颖的框架，包含10条指南和3项具有普遍适用性的活动。研究发现与用户在测试和收集反馈方面的积极协作在移动应用开发的每个阶段都很重要。

Conclusion: 未来研究应考虑进行聚焦的行动研究来评估建议的有效性，并验证其在不同利益相关者群体中的适用性。开发自动化工具以支持在移动应用开发早期检测和缓解可用性问题也值得考虑。

Abstract: Nowadays, mobile applications are essential tools for everyday life,
providing users with anytime, anywhere access to up-to-date information,
communication, and entertainment. Needless to say, hardware limitations and the
diverse needs of different user groups pose a number of design and development
challenges. According to recent studies, usability is one of the most revealing
among many others. However, few have made the direct effort to provide and
discuss what countermeasures can be applied to avoid usability issues in mobile
application development. Through a survey of 20 mobile software design and
development practitioners, this study aims to fill this research gap. Given the
qualitative nature of the data collected, and with the goal of capturing and
preserving the intrinsic meanings embedded in the experts' statements, we
adopted in vivo coding. The analysis of the collected material enabled us to
develop a novel framework consisting of ten guidelines and three activities
with general applications. In addition, it can be noted that active
collaboration with users in testing and collecting feedback was often
emphasized at each stage of mobile application development. Future research
should consider focused action research that evaluates the effectiveness of our
recommendations and validates them across different stakeholder groups. In this
regard, the development of automated tools to support early detection and
mitigation of usability issues during mobile application development could also
be considered.

Motivation: 传统交通信号控制方法（如固定信号控制和感应控制）难以处理动态交通模式，需要更智能的自适应控制来减少拥堵、延误、污染并确保道路安全。

Method: 使用强化学习（PPO算法），通过多种状态表示方法（扩展状态空间、自编码器表示、K-Planes启发表示）来处理高度随机的交通条件，在SUMO模拟器中实现。

Result: 提出的算法在减少排队长度方面优于传统方法和其他RL方法，最佳配置相比传统Webster方法平均排队长度减少约29%。

Conclusion: 基于排队的奖励方法有效，展示了可扩展和自适应城市交通管理的潜力。

Abstract: Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial for reducing congestion,
travel delays, pollution, and for ensuring road safety. Traditional approaches,
such as fixed signal control and actuated control, often struggle to handle
dynamic traffic patterns. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive TSC
framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL), using the Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to minimize total queue lengths across all signal
phases. The challenge of efficiently representing highly stochastic traffic
conditions for an RL controller is addressed through multiple state
representations, including an expanded state space, an autoencoder
representation, and a K-Planes-inspired representation. The proposed algorithm
has been implemented using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic
simulator and demonstrates superior performance over both traditional methods
and other conventional RL-based approaches in reducing queue lengths. The best
performing configuration achieves an approximately 29% reduction in average
queue lengths compared to the traditional Webster method. Furthermore,
comparative evaluation of alternative reward formulations demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed queue-based approach, showcasing the potential
for scalable and adaptive urban traffic management.

Conclusion: 基于决策变换器的去中心化规划框架结合大语言模型，能够高效解决多智能体路径规划问题，在训练时间和环境适应性方面均有显著改进。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) poses a significant and challenging problem
critical for applications in robotics and logistics, particularly due to its
combinatorial complexity and the partial observability inherent in realistic
environments. Decentralized reinforcement learning methods commonly encounter
two substantial difficulties: first, they often yield self-centered behaviors
among agents, resulting in frequent collisions, and second, their reliance on
complex communication modules leads to prolonged training times, sometimes
spanning weeks. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient
decentralized planning framework based on the Decision Transformer (DT),
uniquely leveraging offline reinforcement learning to substantially reduce
training durations from weeks to mere hours. Crucially, our approach
effectively handles long-horizon credit assignment and significantly improves
performance in scenarios with sparse and delayed rewards. Furthermore, to
overcome adaptability limitations inherent in standard RL methods under dynamic
environmental changes, we integrate a large language model (GPT-4o) to
dynamically guide agent policies. Extensive experiments in both static and
dynamically changing environments demonstrate that our DT-based approach,
augmented briefly by GPT-4o, significantly enhances adaptability and
performance.

Conclusion: 提出的两种算法在多智能体在线协调问题上表现有效，特别是MA-MPL算法无需参数调整即可获得良好性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present two effective policy learning algorithms for
multi-agent online coordination(MA-OC) problem. The first one, \texttt{MA-SPL},
not only can achieve the optimal $(1-\frac{c}{e})$-approximation guarantee for
the MA-OC problem with submodular objectives but also can handle the unexplored
$\alpha$-weakly DR-submodular and $(\gamma,\beta)$-weakly submodular scenarios,
where $c$ is the curvature of the investigated submodular functions, $\alpha$
denotes the diminishing-return(DR) ratio and the tuple $(\gamma,\beta)$
represents the submodularity ratios. Subsequently, in order to reduce the
reliance on the unknown parameters $\alpha,\gamma,\beta$ inherent in the
\texttt{MA-SPL} algorithm, we further introduce the second online algorithm
named \texttt{MA-MPL}. This \texttt{MA-MPL} algorithm is entirely
\emph{parameter-free} and simultaneously can maintain the same approximation
ratio as the first \texttt{MA-SPL} algorithm. The core of our \texttt{MA-SPL}
and \texttt{MA-MPL} algorithms is a novel continuous-relaxation technique
termed as \emph{policy-based continuous extension}. Compared with the
well-established \emph{multi-linear extension}, a notable advantage of this new
\emph{policy-based continuous extension} is its ability to provide a lossless
rounding scheme for any set function, thereby enabling us to tackle the
challenging weakly submodular objectives. Finally, extensive simulations are
conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can
incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address
problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward
function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We
apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the
ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to
SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving
careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL
approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no
additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary
models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached
state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without
self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our
model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD
is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly
applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science,
and coding.

TL;DR: 提出了FeatBench基准测试，专门评估大语言模型在"vibe coding"范式下的功能实现能力，弥补现有基准测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试无法充分评估AI代理在vibe coding范式下的能力，因为它们要么需要代码级规范，要么过于关注问题解决，而忽略了功能实现这一关键场景。

Method: 构建FeatBench基准测试，具有纯自然语言提示、严格的数据收集流程、全面的测试用例和多样化的应用领域等特征。

Result: 评估显示vibe coding范式下的功能实现具有显著挑战性，最高成功率仅为29.94%。分析还发现了"激进实现"策略，这种策略既会导致关键失败，又能产生优越的软件设计。

Conclusion: FeatBench为社区研究提供了新的基准测试工具，揭示了vibe coding范式下功能实现的挑战性和复杂性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a
novel software development paradigm known as "vibe coding," where users
interact with coding agents through high-level natural language. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks for code generation inadequately assess an
agent's vibe coding capabilities. Existing benchmarks are misaligned, as they
either require code-level specifications or focus narrowly on issue-solving,
neglecting the critical scenario of feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradiam. To address this gap, we propose FeatBench, a novel benchmark
for vibe coding that focuses on feature implementation. Our benchmark is
distinguished by several key features: 1. Pure Natural Language Prompts. Task
inputs consist solely of abstract natural language descriptions, devoid of any
code or structural hints. 2. A Rigorous & Evolving Data Collection Process.
FeatBench is built on a multi-level filtering pipeline to ensure quality and a
fully automated pipeline to evolve the benchmark, mitigating data
contamination. 3. Comprehensive Test Cases. Each task includes Fail-to-Pass
(F2P) and Pass-to-Pass (P2P) tests to verify correctness and prevent
regressions. 4. Diverse Application Domains. The benchmark includes
repositories from diverse domains to ensure it reflects real-world scenarios.
We evaluate two state-of-the-art agent frameworks with four leading LLMs on
FeatBench. Our evaluation reveals that feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradigm is a significant challenge, with the highest success rate of
only 29.94%. Our analysis also reveals a tendency for "aggressive
implementation," a strategy that paradoxically leads to both critical failures
and superior software design. We release FeatBench, our automated collection
pipeline, and all experimental results to facilitate further community
research.

Conclusion: MoT-G通过保持更高的隐藏状态熵和促进令牌空间探索来提升推理性能，证明了在RLVR中利用分布信息的价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading
approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most
current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which
samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and
adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample
discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional
information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens.
While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven
beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily
constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To
address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in
RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G
approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture
embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate
directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought.
Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive
language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements
(5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the
Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of
trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive
hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's
benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy
throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.

Method: 评估了多个生产和开源系统，采用严格的DER协议对重叠进行评分，并通过在口音匹配数据上微调分割模块进行轻量级领域适应。

Result: 临床语音存在显著的领域惩罚，错误分析显示主要源于误报和漏检。领域适应减少了错误但未能完全消除差距。

Conclusion: 需要开发重叠感知的分割方法和平衡的临床资源作为实际改进方向，同时提供了易于复现的领域适应方案。

Abstract: This study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for
African-accented English. We evaluate multiple production and open systems on
general and clinical dialogues under a strict DER protocol that scores overlap.
A consistent domain penalty appears for clinical speech and remains significant
across models. Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms
and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap. We test
lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on
accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap. Our
contributions include a controlled benchmark across domains, a concise approach
to error decomposition and conversation-level profiling, and an adaptation
recipe that is easy to reproduce. Results point to overlap-aware segmentation
and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps.

TL;DR: OjaKV是一个KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合存储策略和在线子空间自适应来减少长上下文推理的内存瓶颈，同时保持或提高零样本准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型长上下文推理中的KV缓存内存瓶颈问题，现有静态压缩方法在数据分布变化时性能不佳。

Method: 采用混合存储策略：完整保留关键的首尾token，对中间token使用Oja算法进行在线PCA低秩压缩，包括预填充阶段的全面更新和解码阶段的轻量级周期性更新。

Result: 在高压缩比下保持或提高零样本准确性，在需要复杂推理的超长上下文基准测试中表现最佳，证明在线子空间自适应能有效跟踪上下文变化。

Conclusion: OjaKV是一个实用、即插即用的解决方案，无需模型微调即可实现内存高效的长上下文推理。

Abstract: The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are
constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache
required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for
instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of
4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's
weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising
direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that
performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid
storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that
not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial
first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors
for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies
low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's
algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a
comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates
during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving
context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention
modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or
even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular,
OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require
complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in
dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid
framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient
long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在流式应用（如实时翻译）中难以直接使用的问题，需要持续更新输出同时保持合理计算成本以满足延迟要求。

Method: 使用最近输出作为当前增长输入上下文的草稿，在验证阶段偏向草稿token以提高接受率，无需草稿计算，是一种模型无关的即插即用解决方案。

Result: 在同时文本到文本重翻译任务中，相比传统自回归重翻译实现1.7倍加速且不损失质量，结合display-only mask-k技术显著减少80%闪烁。

Conclusion: 提出的自推测偏置解码方法为延迟敏感的流式应用提供了一种有效的加速解决方案，无需草稿计算，具有模型无关性和即插即用特性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging
to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation),
where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while
still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency
requirement.
  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous
translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference
paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a
consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a
draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the
output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance
rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but
also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the
point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end
condition is met.
  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the
need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play
solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications.
Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate
that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional
auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it
significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only
mask-k technique.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究对结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响存在矛盾结论，且评估方法存在测试场景受限、比较设置不严谨、依赖粗粒度指标等局限性。

Method: 基于一个假设和两个保证约束，推导出五种潜在因果结构，在七个公开和一个自建推理任务上进行因果推断分析。

Result: 粗粒度指标显示结构化输出对GPT-4o生成有正、负或中性影响，但因果推断显示48个场景中43个无因果影响，仅5个存在受具体指令影响的多方面因果结构。

Conclusion: 结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响被先前研究夸大，实际因果影响有限，仅在特定指令场景下存在复杂因果效应。

Abstract: Structured output from large language models (LLMs) has enhanced efficiency
in processing generated information and is increasingly adopted in industrial
applications. Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output
on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest
that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others
argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions
in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments
include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings,
and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis
using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we
derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of
structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2)
collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from
output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed
reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or
neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal
inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining
5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete
instructions.

TL;DR: RL-ZVP是一种新的强化学习算法，能够从零方差提示中提取学习信号，在数学推理基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO只关注模型响应正确性不同的情况，忽略了所有响应获得相同奖励的零方差提示，而这些提示实际上可以提供有意义的学习反馈。

Method: RL-ZVP算法直接从零方差提示中提取学习信号，直接奖励正确性和惩罚错误，无需对比不同响应，并通过标记级特征调节反馈以保留信息丰富的细微信号。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，RL-ZVP相比GRPO在准确率上提升了8.61个百分点，通过率提升了7.77个百分点，且始终优于过滤掉零方差提示的其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 零方差提示在RLVR中具有未开发的潜力，RL-ZVP证明了从这些提示中学习的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework
for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to
the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses
receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we
argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful
feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with
Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals
from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes
errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level
characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math
reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61
points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently
outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These
results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts
in RLVR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE)训练框架，解决MoE模型在推理时增加激活专家数量导致性能下降的问题，显著扩展了性能扩展范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型在训练和推理时固定激活专家数量k，直觉上推理时激活更多专家(k'>k)应该提升性能，但实验发现性能反而会快速下降，这源于专家间缺乏学习到的协作。

Method: 引入EMoE训练框架，同时训练专家在多样化组合中协作，并鼓励路由器进行高质量选择，确保在推理时不同计算预算下都能获得稳健性能。

Result: 在多种MoE设置上的实验表明，EMoE显著扩展了有效性能扩展范围，可达训练时k的2-3倍，同时将模型峰值性能推向更高水平。

Conclusion: EMoE框架成功解决了MoE模型在推理时扩展专家数量的性能下降问题，实现了更灵活的计算预算适应性和更高的性能上限。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models typically fix the number of activated experts
$k$ at both training and inference. Intuitively, activating more experts at
inference $k'$ (where $k'> k$) means engaging a larger set of model parameters
for the computation and thus is expected to improve performance. However,
contrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that
performance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the
number of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems
from a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we
introduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that
enables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference
without incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training
experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for
high-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational
budgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings.
Our results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective
performance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2-3$\times$ the
training-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher
level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer模型从训练样本中学习传递关系推断的能力，以及模型规模如何影响这种能力，填补了现有研究主要关注上下文学习而忽视训练学习的空白。

Method: 生成有向图来训练不同规模的Transformer模型，评估它们在不同图大小下推断传递关系的能力，特别关注网格图的维度对学习难度的影响。

Result: Transformer能够学习低维网格状有向图的连通性，图维度是预测学习能力的重要指标，高维网格图更具挑战性。增加模型规模能改善在网格图上的泛化能力，但在包含多个不连通分量的非网格图上表现较差。

Conclusion: Transformer学习传递关系的能力受图结构特性（如维度、连通性）和模型规模的共同影响，在结构简单的网格图上表现良好，但在复杂图上存在学习困难。

Abstract: Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the
responses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust
reasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as
causal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of
transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A
causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive
relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,
knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then
there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can
learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input
prompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from
training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this
study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train
transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer
transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that
transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like'' directed
graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and
connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that
the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of
transformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional
grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In
addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly
better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the
graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components,
transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the
number of components is large.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM主导的时代，了解其在法律等高风险领域的能力和局限性至关重要，特别是在多语言、跨司法管辖区和对抗性环境中的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用LLM-as-a-Judge方法进行人类对齐评估，构建开源模块化评估管道，通过字符和词级扰动测试对抗鲁棒性，涵盖分类、摘要、开放问题和一般推理等法律任务。

Result: 法律推理基准LEXam上准确率常低于50%，而通用任务XNLI上超过70%；英语结果更稳定但不总是更准确；LLaMA弱于Gemini，后者平均优势约24个百分点；语言性能与其与英语的句法相似性相关。

Conclusion: 尽管新LLM有所改进，但在关键多语言法律应用中可靠部署仍面临挑战，法律任务对LLM构成显著困难，需要进一步研究提升其表现。

Abstract: In an era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding their
capabilities and limitations, especially in high-stakes fields like law, is
crucial. While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini,
DeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal
workflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and
adversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA
and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their
adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level
perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation.
We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to
support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and
datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification,
summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that
legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below
50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on
general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields
more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt
sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across
languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a
language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is
weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24
percentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs,
challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM表示提供了高效、可扩展且高度可解释的解决方案，能够实时适应动态扩展的模型库。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results over various tasks,
and ever-expanding public repositories contain an abundance of pre-trained
models. Therefore, identifying the best-performing LLM for a given task is a
significant challenge. Previous works have suggested learning LLM
representations to address this. However, these approaches present limited
scalability and require costly retraining to encompass additional models and
datasets. Moreover, the produced representation utilizes distinct spaces that
cannot be easily interpreted. This work presents an efficient, training-free
approach to representing LLMs as linear operators within the prompts' semantic
task space, thus providing a highly interpretable representation of the models'
application. Our method utilizes closed-form computation of geometrical
properties and ensures exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to
dynamically expanding repositories. We demonstrate our approach on success
prediction and model selection tasks, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art
results with notable performance in out-of-sample scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StateX是一种训练流程，通过后训练有效扩展预训练RNN的状态大小，提升长上下文召回能力，而不显著增加参数或训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的模型在处理长上下文时成本高，而RNN虽然复杂度低但召回能力不足，因为所有上下文信息被压缩到固定大小的循环状态中。

Method: 为线性注意力和状态空间模型设计后训练架构修改，扩展状态大小而不增加或仅轻微增加模型参数。

Result: 在1.3B参数模型上的实验表明，StateX有效提升了RNN的召回和上下文学习能力，且不产生高后训练成本或损害其他能力。

Conclusion: StateX提供了一种高效扩展RNN状态大小的方法，显著提升了长上下文处理能力，同时保持了训练效率。

Abstract: While Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable language modeling
performance, their high complexities result in high costs when processing long
contexts. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear
attention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant
per-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks
that require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts,
because all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent
state. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated
with the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent
states results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a
training pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs
through post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and
state space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to
scale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.
Experiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently
enhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring
high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that
treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through
variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend
it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL
formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We
further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including
GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit
weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a
previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our
method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of
reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic
perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields
stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models. Our

TL;DR: 提出反馈条件策略(FCP)，将语言反馈作为条件信号而非标量奖励，通过最大似然训练学习反馈条件后验，并开发在线自举阶段来优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法将丰富反馈压缩为标量奖励，丢失信息并导致尺度不平衡，需要更直接利用语言反馈的方法。

Method: FCP从响应-反馈对中直接学习，通过最大似然训练近似反馈条件后验，并加入在线自举阶段在正向条件下生成并接收新反馈来优化。

Result: 将反馈驱动学习重新定义为条件生成而非奖励优化，为LLMs提供更丰富的方式直接从语言反馈中学习。

Conclusion: FCP框架为LLMs学习语言反馈提供了更富表达力的方法，超越了传统的标量奖励优化范式。

Abstract: LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods
typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of
their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal
feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image
generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the
feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback
pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum
likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping
stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh
feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as
conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more
expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.

Abstract: Discrete flow models offer a powerful framework for learning distributions
over discrete state spaces and have demonstrated superior performance compared
to the discrete diffusion model. However, their convergence properties and
error analysis remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a unified
framework grounded in stochastic calculus theory to systematically investigate
the theoretical properties of discrete flow. Specifically, we derive the KL
divergence of two path measures regarding two continuous-time Markov chains
(CTMCs) with different transition rates by developing a novel Girsanov-type
theorem, and provide a comprehensive analysis that encompasses the error
arising from transition rate estimation and early stopping, where the first
type of error has rarely been analyzed by existing works. Unlike discrete
diffusion models, discrete flow incurs no truncation error caused by truncating
the time horizon in the noising process. Building on generator matching and
uniformization, we establish non-asymptotic error bounds for distribution
estimation. Our results provide the first error analysis for discrete flow
models.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过直接估计偏差校正项来估计倾向得分，从而提高平均处理效应(ATE)的估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的倾向得分估计方法（如最大似然或协变量平衡）可能无法最优地估计偏差校正项或ATE，因此需要更直接的方法。

Method: 提出通过最小化偏差校正项的预测误差来直接估计倾向得分，采用Bregman散度最小化的通用框架。

Result: 通过模拟研究评估了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 直接估计偏差校正项的方法有望提高ATE估计的准确性。

Abstract: This study considers the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE).
For ATE estimation, we estimate the propensity score through direct
bias-correction term estimation. Let $\{(X_i, D_i, Y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be the
observations, where $X_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ denotes $p$-dimensional covariates,
$D_i \in \{0, 1\}$ denotes a binary treatment assignment indicator, and $Y_i
\in \mathbb{R}$ is an outcome. In ATE estimation, the bias-correction term
$h_0(X_i, D_i) = \frac{1[D_i = 1]}{e_0(X_i)} - \frac{1[D_i = 0]}{1 - e_0(X_i)}$
plays an important role, where $e_0(X_i)$ is the propensity score, the
probability of being assigned treatment $1$. In this study, we propose
estimating $h_0$ (or equivalently the propensity score $e_0$) by directly
minimizing the prediction error of $h_0$. Since the bias-correction term $h_0$
is essential for ATE estimation, this direct approach is expected to improve
estimation accuracy for the ATE. For example, existing studies often employ
maximum likelihood or covariate balancing to estimate $e_0$, but these
approaches may not be optimal for accurately estimating $h_0$ or the ATE. We
present a general framework for this direct bias-correction term estimation
approach from the perspective of Bregman divergence minimization and conduct
simulation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Result: 专用机器学习算法在恢复再电离历史方面平均R²得分超过0.95

Conclusion: 现代深度学习技术有益于早期宇宙研究，能够实现准确精确的宇宙学和天体物理推断

Abstract: Hydrogen is the most abundant element in our Universe. The first generation
of stars and galaxies produced photons that ionized hydrogen gas, driving a
cosmological event known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The upcoming
Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will map the distribution of neutral
hydrogen during this era, aiding in the study of the properties of these
first-generation objects. Extracting astrophysical information will be
challenging, as SKAO will produce a tremendous amount of data where the
hydrogen signal will be contaminated with undesired foreground contamination
and instrumental systematics. To address this, we develop the latest deep
learning techniques to extract information from the 2D power spectra of the
hydrogen signal expected from SKAO. We apply a series of neural network models
to these measurements and quantify their ability to predict the history of
cosmic hydrogen reionization, which is connected to the increasing number and
efficiency of early photon sources. We show that the study of the early
Universe benefits from modern deep learning technology. In particular, we
demonstrate that dedicated machine learning algorithms can achieve more than a
$0.95$ $R^2$ score on average in recovering the reionization history. This
enables accurate and precise cosmological and astrophysical inference of
structure formation in the early Universe.

Abstract: The evaluation of new microprocessor designs is constrained by slow,
cycle-accurate simulators that rely on unrepresentative benchmark traces. This
paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for high-fidelity,
``in-the-wild'' simulation on production hardware. Our core contribution is a
DL model trained on microarchitecture-independent features to predict
cycle-level performance for hypothetical processor designs. This unique
approach allows the model to be deployed on existing silicon to evaluate future
hardware. We propose a complete system featuring a lightweight hardware trace
collector and a principled sampling strategy to minimize user impact. This
system achieves a simulation speed of 5 MIPS on a commodity GPU, imposing a
mere 0.1% performance overhead. Furthermore, our co-designed Neutrino on-chip
accelerator improves performance by 85x over the GPU. We demonstrate that this
framework enables accurate performance analysis and large-scale hardware A/B
testing on a massive scale using real-world applications.

Conclusion: 通过将因果结构学习问题转化为二部图匹配和自适应优化问题，提供了一种高效且理论保证的方法来结合观测和干预数据学习因果图。

Abstract: We study the problem of causal structure learning from a combination of
observational and interventional data generated by a linear non-Gaussian
structural equation model that might contain cycles. Recent results show that
using mere observational data identifies the causal graph only up to a
permutation-equivalence class. We obtain a combinatorial characterization of
this class by showing that each graph in an equivalence class corresponds to a
perfect matching in a bipartite graph. This bipartite representation allows us
to analyze how interventions modify or constrain the matchings. Specifically,
we show that each atomic intervention reveals one edge of the true matching and
eliminates all incompatible causal graphs. Consequently, we formalize the
optimal experiment design task as an adaptive stochastic optimization problem
over the set of equivalence classes with a natural reward function that
quantifies how many graphs are eliminated from the equivalence class by an
intervention. We show that this reward function is adaptive submodular and
provide a greedy policy with a provable near-optimal performance guarantee. A
key technical challenge is to efficiently estimate the reward function without
having to explicitly enumerate all the graphs in the equivalence class. We
propose a sampling-based estimator using random matchings and analyze its bias
and concentration behavior. Our simulation results show that performing a small
number of interventions guided by our stochastic optimization framework
recovers the true underlying causal structure.

Conclusion: 该分析为稀疏贝叶斯学习提供了更深入的理论理解，特别是在非高斯假设下超参数估计的收敛特性，并验证了快速SBL算法在高斯情况下的有效性。

Abstract: Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) associates to each weight in the underlying
linear model a hyperparameter by assuming that each weight is Gaussian
distributed with zero mean and precision (inverse variance) equal to its
associated hyperparameter. The method estimates the hyperparameters by
marginalizing out the weights and performing (marginalized) maximum likelihood
(ML) estimation. SBL returns many hyperparameter estimates to diverge to
infinity, effectively setting the estimates of the corresponding weights to
zero (i.e., pruning the corresponding weights from the model) and thereby
yielding a sparse estimate of the weight vector.
  In this letter, we analyze the marginal likelihood as function of a single
hyperparameter while keeping the others fixed, when the Gaussian assumptions on
the noise samples and the weight distribution that underlies the derivation of
SBL are weakened. We derive sufficient conditions that lead, on the one hand,
to finite hyperparameter estimates and, on the other, to infinite ones.
Finally, we show that in the Gaussian case, the two conditions are
complementary and coincide with the pruning condition of fast SBL (F-SBL),
thereby providing additional insights into this algorithm.

Motivation: 在多模态学习中，共享和模态特定特征对于表征细胞状态和支持下游分析都很关键。理想情况下，模态特定特征应与共享特征独立，同时捕获每个模态内的所有补充信息。

Method: IndiSeek方法结合独立性强制目标和计算高效的重建损失，该重建损失约束条件互信息，明确平衡独立性和完整性。

Result: 在合成模拟、CITE-seq数据集和多个真实世界多模态基准测试中证明了IndiSeek的有效性。

Conclusion: IndiSeek能够原则性地提取模态特定特征，解决了基于互信息的目标在实际中难以可靠估计的问题。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations is a fundamental task in multi-modal
learning. In modern applications such as single-cell multi-omics, both shared
and modality-specific features are critical for characterizing cell states and
supporting downstream analyses. Ideally, modality-specific features should be
independent of shared ones while also capturing all complementary information
within each modality. This tradeoff is naturally expressed through
information-theoretic criteria, but mutual-information-based objectives are
difficult to estimate reliably, and their variational surrogates often
underperform in practice. In this paper, we introduce IndiSeek, a novel
disentangled representation learning approach that addresses this challenge by
combining an independence-enforcing objective with a computationally efficient
reconstruction loss that bounds conditional mutual information. This
formulation explicitly balances independence and completeness, enabling
principled extraction of modality-specific features. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of IndiSeek on synthetic simulations, a CITE-seq dataset and
multiple real-world multi-modal benchmarks.

Abstract: Real-world applications often face scarce labeled data due to the high cost
and time requirements of gold-standard experiments, whereas unlabeled data are
typically abundant. With the growing adoption of machine learning techniques,
it has become increasingly feasible to generate multiple predicted labels using
a variety of models and algorithms, including deep learning, large language
models, and generative AI. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
safely and adaptively aggregates multiple black-box predictions with unknown
quality while preserving valid statistical inference. Our method provides two
key guarantees: (i) it never performs worse than using the labeled data alone,
regardless of the quality of the predictions; and (ii) if any one of the
predictions (without knowing which one) perfectly fits the ground truth, the
algorithm adaptively exploits this to achieve either a faster convergence rate
or the semiparametric efficiency bound. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm through experiments on both synthetic and benchmark
datasets.

Abstract: As data collection and simulation capabilities advance, multi-modal learning,
the task of learning from multiple modalities and sources of data, is becoming
an increasingly important area of research. Surrogate models that learn from
data of multiple auxiliary modalities to support the modeling of a highly
expensive quantity of interest have the potential to aid outer loop
applications such as optimization, inverse problems, or sensitivity analyses
when multi-modal data are available. We develop two multi-modal Bayesian neural
network surrogate models and leverage conditionally conjugate distributions in
the last layer to estimate model parameters using stochastic variational
inference (SVI). We provide a method to perform this conjugate SVI estimation
in the presence of partially missing observations. We demonstrate improved
prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification compared to uni-modal
surrogate models for both scalar and time series data.

Motivation: 传统主动学习策略存在目标不匹配问题，它们旨在减少模型参数或可观测事实结果的不确定性，而非直接针对真正感兴趣的不可观测因果量(如潜在结果和CATE)。

Method: 基于因果目标对齐原则，开发了Causal-EPIG框架，将预期预测信息增益(EPIG)标准应用于因果量。从该框架推导出两种策略：全面方法(通过联合潜在结果建模完整因果机制)和聚焦方法(直接针对CATE估计量)。

Conclusion: 该框架为实践中样本高效的CATE估计提供了原则性指导，解决了主动学习中因果目标不匹配的根本问题。

Abstract: Estimating the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) is often
constrained by the high cost of obtaining outcome measurements, making active
learning essential. However, conventional active learning strategies suffer
from a fundamental objective mismatch. They are designed to reduce uncertainty
in model parameters or in observable factual outcomes, failing to directly
target the unobservable causal quantities that are the true objects of
interest. To address this misalignment, we introduce the principle of causal
objective alignment, which posits that acquisition functions should target
unobservable causal quantities, such as the potential outcomes and the CATE,
rather than indirect proxies. We operationalize this principle through the
Causal-EPIG framework, which adapts the information-theoretic criterion of
Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG) to explicitly quantify the value of
a query in terms of reducing uncertainty about unobservable causal quantities.
From this unified framework, we derive two distinct strategies that embody a
fundamental trade-off: a comprehensive approach that robustly models the full
causal mechanisms via the joint potential outcomes, and a focused approach that
directly targets the CATE estimand for maximum sample efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our strategies consistently outperform standard
baselines, and crucially, reveal that the optimal strategy is
context-dependent, contingent on the base estimator and data complexity. Our
framework thus provides a principled guide for sample-efficient CATE estimation
in practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of distributed mean estimation with 1-bit
communication constraints. We propose a mean estimator that is based on
(randomized and sequentially-chosen) interval queries, whose 1-bit outcome
indicates whether the given sample lies in the specified interval. Our
estimator is $(\epsilon, \delta)$-PAC for all distributions with bounded mean
($-\lambda \le \mathbb{E}(X) \le \lambda $) and variance ($\mathrm{Var}(X) \le
\sigma^2$) for some known parameters $\lambda$ and $\sigma$. We derive a sample
complexity bound $\widetilde{O}\big(
\frac{\sigma^2}{\epsilon^2}\log\frac{1}{\delta} +
\log\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}\big)$, which matches the minimax lower bound for the
unquantized setting up to logarithmic factors and the additional
$\log\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}$ term that we show to be unavoidable. We also
establish an adaptivity gap for interval-query based estimators: the best
non-adaptive mean estimator is considerably worse than our adaptive mean
estimator for large $\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}$. Finally, we give tightened sample
complexity bounds for distributions with stronger tail decay, and present
additional variants that (i) handle an unknown sampling budget (ii) adapt to
the unknown true variance given (possibly loose) upper and lower bounds on the
variance, and (iii) use only two stages of adaptivity at the expense of more
complicated (non-interval) queries.

Abstract: Hawkes process models are used in settings where past events increase the
likelihood of future events occurring. Many applications record events as
counts on a regular grid, yet discrete-time Hawkes models remain comparatively
underused and are often constrained by fixed-form baselines and excitation
kernels. In particular, there is a lack of flexible, nonparametric treatments
of both the baseline and the excitation in discrete time. To this end, we
propose the Gaussian Process Discrete Hawkes Process (GP-DHP), a nonparametric
framework that places Gaussian process priors on both the baseline and the
excitation and performs inference through a collapsed latent representation.
This yields smooth, data-adaptive structure without prespecifying trends,
periodicities, or decay shapes, and enables maximum a posteriori (MAP)
estimation with near-linear-time \(O(T\log T)\) complexity. A closed-form
projection recovers interpretable baseline and excitation functions from the
optimized latent trajectory. In simulations, GP-DHP recovers diverse excitation
shapes and evolving baselines. In case studies on U.S. terrorism incidents and
weekly Cryptosporidiosis counts, it improves test predictive log-likelihood
over standard parametric discrete Hawkes baselines while capturing bursts,
delays, and seasonal background variation. The results indicate that flexible
discrete-time self-excitation can be achieved without sacrificing scalability
or interpretability.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 对回声状态网络(ESN)在教师-学生设置中进行严格渐近分析，推导出偏差、方差和均方误差的闭式表达式，揭示了ESN与经典岭回归的两个关键差异，并提供了最优正则化的显式公式和计算方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为回声状态网络提供可解释的理论基础和实用的调参指南，将最近的实证观察与可证明的性能保证相统一。

Method: 利用随机矩阵理论，在具有oracle权重的线性教师设置下，推导ESN的渐近偏差、方差和均方误差的闭式表达式。

Result: 发现ESN与经典岭回归的两个关键差异：(i) ESN不表现出双下降现象；(ii) 当训练样本数和教师记忆长度都有限时，ESN获得更低的MSE。提供了最优正则化的显式公式和高效数值计算方案。

Conclusion: 该分析为ESN提供了可解释的理论框架和实用的调参指南，有助于统一实证观察与理论性能保证。

Abstract: We present a rigorous asymptotic analysis of Echo State Networks (ESNs) in a
teacher student setting with a linear teacher with oracle weights. Leveraging
random matrix theory, we derive closed form expressions for the asymptotic
bias, variance, and mean-squared error (MSE) as functions of the input
statistics, the oracle vector, and the ridge regularization parameter. The
analysis reveals two key departures from classical ridge regression: (i) ESNs
do not exhibit double descent, and (ii) ESNs attain lower MSE when both the
number of training samples and the teacher memory length are limited. We
further provide an explicit formula for the optimal regularization in the
identity input covariance case, and propose an efficient numerical scheme to
compute the optimum in the general case. Together, these results offer
interpretable theory and practical guidelines for tuning ESNs, helping
reconcile recent empirical observations with provable performance guarantees

TL;DR: 该论文首次提供了带有高斯先验的MAP回归在训练和测试风险上的精确渐近特征，揭示了偏差-方差-先验权衡，解释了双重下降现象，并量化了先验失配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正则化线性回归是机器学习的核心，但在高维情况下使用信息先验时的行为仍未被充分理解，需要统一ridge回归、最小二乘和先验信息估计器的理论框架。

Method: 使用随机矩阵理论，为以领域信息初始化为中心的高斯先验MAP回归提供闭式风险公式，并识别测试风险的最小化闭式解。

Result: 理论框架统一了多种回归方法，揭示了偏差-方差-先验权衡，解释了双重下降现象，并提供了最优正则化参数的简单估计器。模拟验证了理论的高精度。

Conclusion: 通过连接贝叶斯先验、经典正则化和现代渐近理论，该研究为使用结构化先验知识的学习提供了概念清晰性和实践指导。

Abstract: Regularized linear regression is central to machine learning, yet its
high-dimensional behavior with informative priors remains poorly understood. We
provide the first exact asymptotic characterization of training and test risks
for maximum a posteriori (MAP) regression with Gaussian priors centered at a
domain-informed initialization. Our framework unifies ridge regression, least
squares, and prior-informed estimators, and -- using random matrix theory --
yields closed-form risk formulas that expose the bias-variance-prior tradeoff,
explain double descent, and quantify prior mismatch. We also identify a
closed-form minimizer of test risk, enabling a simple estimator of the optimal
regularization parameter. Simulations confirm the theory with high accuracy. By
connecting Bayesian priors, classical regularization, and modern asymptotics,
our results provide both conceptual clarity and practical guidance for learning
with structured prior knowledge.

Motivation: 研究模型崩溃现象，即生成模型在反复使用自身合成输出进行训练时性能下降的问题，探索如何通过混合真实数据和合成数据来防止模型崩溃。

Method: 采用过参数化线性回归框架，分析最小L2范数插值和岭回归在迭代训练过程中的泛化误差，推导最优混合权重公式，并验证理论结果。

Result: 发现最小L2范数插值的最优真实数据比例收敛于黄金分割比的倒数，岭回归的最优混合比例至少为1/2，表明需要优先使用真实数据。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和模拟验证，确定了防止模型崩溃的最优数据混合策略，为生成模型的可持续训练提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Model collapse occurs when generative models degrade after repeatedly
training on their own synthetic outputs. We study this effect in
overparameterized linear regression in a setting where each iteration mixes
fresh real labels with synthetic labels drawn from the model fitted in the
previous iteration. We derive precise generalization error formulae for
minimum-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation and ridge regression under this iterative
scheme. Our analysis reveals intriguing properties of the optimal mixing weight
that minimizes long-term prediction error and provably prevents model collapse.
For instance, in the case of min-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation, we establish that
the optimal real-data proportion converges to the reciprocal of the golden
ratio for fairly general classes of covariate distributions. Previously, this
property was known only for ordinary least squares, and additionally in low
dimensions. For ridge regression, we further analyze two popular model classes
-- the random-effects model and the spiked covariance model -- demonstrating
how spectral geometry governs optimal weighting. In both cases, as well as for
isotropic features, we uncover that the optimal mixing ratio should be at least
one-half, reflecting the necessity of favoring real-data over synthetic. We
validate our theoretical results with extensive simulations.

TL;DR: VecUQ-OT是一个多维不确定性量化框架，通过将互补的不确定性度量堆叠成向量，并使用基于最优传输的排序方法产生Monge-Kantorovich秩来评估预测不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不确定性量化方法通常提供单一标量值来衡量模型可靠性，但不同的不确定性度量可能提供关于预测置信度的互补信息，即使针对相同类型的不确定性也可能捕捉到不同的失效模式。

Method: 将互补的不确定性度量堆叠成向量，使用熵正则化最优传输学习分布内数据得分向量的传输映射，通过Monge-Kantorovich秩对预测不确定性进行排序。

Result: VecUQ-OT在合成、图像和文本数据上表现出高效性，即使单个度量失效时也能保持稳健。支持选择性预测、误分类检测、分布外检测和选择性生成等下游任务。

Conclusion: 该框架支持灵活的非加性不确定性融合，包括偶然性和认知性分量，为下游任务提供稳健的排序，且无需重新训练即可应用于未见输入，包括分布外情况。

Abstract: Most uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches provide a single scalar value
as a measure of model reliability. However, different uncertainty measures
could provide complementary information on the prediction confidence. Even
measures targeting the same type of uncertainty (e.g., ensemble-based and
density-based measures of epistemic uncertainty) may capture different failure
modes.
  We take a multidimensional view on UQ by stacking complementary UQ measures
into a vector. Such vectors are assigned with Monge-Kantorovich ranks produced
by an optimal-transport-based ordering method. The prediction is then deemed
more uncertain than the other if it has a higher rank.
  The resulting VecUQ-OT algorithm uses entropy-regularized optimal transport.
The transport map is learned on vectors of scores from in-distribution data
and, by design, applies to unseen inputs, including out-of-distribution cases,
without retraining.
  Our framework supports flexible non-additive uncertainty fusion (including
aleatoric and epistemic components). It yields a robust ordering for downstream
tasks such as selective prediction, misclassification detection,
out-of-distribution detection, and selective generation. Across synthetic,
image, and text data, VecUQ-OT shows high efficiency even when individual
measures fail. The code for the method is available at:

Motivation: 现代扩散、流和其他匹配模型虽然生成质量优秀，但推理速度慢，需要多步迭代生成。现有的蒸馏方法通常局限于特定框架，且无法有效利用真实数据。

Method: 提出了RealUID框架，基于简单理论基础，覆盖了流匹配和扩散模型的先前蒸馏方法，并可扩展到桥匹配和随机插值等变体。

Result: 该框架能够在不使用GAN的情况下将真实数据整合到蒸馏过程中，提供了一种通用的解决方案。

Conclusion: RealUID为各种匹配模型提供了一个统一且实用的蒸馏框架，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: While achieving exceptional generative quality, modern diffusion, flow, and
other matching models suffer from slow inference, as they require many steps of
iterative generation. Recent distillation methods address this by training
efficient one-step generators under the guidance of a pre-trained teacher
model. However, these methods are often constrained to only one specific
framework, e.g., only to diffusion or only to flow models. Furthermore, these
methods are naturally data-free, and to benefit from the usage of real data, it
is required to use an additional complex adversarial training with an extra
discriminator model. In this paper, we present RealUID, a universal
distillation framework for all matching models that seamlessly incorporates
real data into the distillation procedure without GANs. Our RealUID approach
offers a simple theoretical foundation that covers previous distillation
methods for Flow Matching and Diffusion models, and is also extended to their
modifications, such as Bridge Matching and Stochastic Interpolants.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在估计异质处理效应方面表现出色，但其不透明性限制了在医学、经济学和公共政策等敏感领域的信任和采用。

Method: 基于成熟的因果神经架构，将条件平均处理效应估计器转换为KANs，并融入剪枝和符号简化技术。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，causalKANs在CATE误差指标上与神经基线表现相当，即使是简单的KAN变体也能达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: causalKANs通过结合可靠性和分析可访问性，提供了由闭式表达式和可解释图支持的可审计估计器，能够在高风险环境中实现可信的个性化决策。

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance in estimating
heterogeneous treatment effects, but their opacity limits trust and adoption in
sensitive domains such as medicine, economics, and public policy. Building on
well-established and high-performing causal neural architectures, we propose
causalKANs, a framework that transforms neural estimators of conditional
average treatment effects (CATEs) into Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs). By
incorporating pruning and symbolic simplification, causalKANs yields
interpretable closed-form formulas while preserving predictive accuracy.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that causalKANs perform on par
with neural baselines in CATE error metrics, and that even simple KAN variants
achieve competitive performance, offering a favorable
accuracy--interpretability trade-off. By combining reliability with analytic
accessibility, causalKANs provide auditable estimators supported by closed-form
expressions and interpretable plots, enabling trustworthy individualized
decision-making in high-stakes settings. We release the code for
reproducibility at https://github.com/aalmodovares/causalkans .

Motivation: 传统保形预测方法如CD-split虽然提高了效率，但产生的预测集由多个不连续子区间组成，难以解释。

Method: 在保形预测框架中引入平滑操作，帮助合并子区间，形成更可解释的预测集。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，SCD-split在区间长度和不连续子区间数量之间取得了平衡。理论上证明在特定条件下能减少不连续子区间数量。

Conclusion: SCD-split方法能够生成更可解释的预测集，同时保持与CD-split相当的覆盖保证和区间长度。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a distribution-free framework for constructing
statistically rigorous prediction sets. While popular variants such as CD-split
improve CP's efficiency, they often yield prediction sets composed of multiple
disconnected subintervals, which are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we
propose SCD-split, which incorporates smoothing operations into the CP
framework. Such smoothing operations potentially help merge the subintervals,
thus leading to interpretable prediction sets. Experimental results on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SCD-split balances the
interval length and the number of disconnected subintervals. Theoretically,
under specific conditions, SCD-split provably reduces the number of
disconnected subintervals while maintaining comparable coverage guarantees and
interval length compared with CD-split.

Motivation: 在观察性研究中，当处理变量和结果变量存在未测量的混杂因素但观测到的中介变量无混杂时，前门调整可以通过中介变量识别因果效应。需要开发能够有效估计异质性处理效应的方法。

Method: 引入了两种去偏学习器：FD-DR-Learner和FD-R-Learner，基于前门调整框架，即使在干扰函数收敛速度仅为n^-1/4时也能实现去偏。

Result: 通过误差分析证明了方法的去偏性，在合成研究和真实世界案例（使用FARS数据集分析安全带法律）中表现出稳健的实证性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的学习器在前门调整场景下能够提供可靠且样本效率高的异质性处理效应估计。

Abstract: In observational settings where treatment and outcome share unmeasured
confounders but an observed mediator remains unconfounded, the front-door (FD)
adjustment identifies causal effects through the mediator. We study the
heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) under FD identification and introduce two
debiased learners: FD-DR-Learner and FD-R-Learner. Both attain fast,
quasi-oracle rates (i.e., performance comparable to an oracle that knows the
nuisances) even when nuisance functions converge as slowly as n^-1/4. We
provide error analyses establishing debiasedness and demonstrate robust
empirical performance in synthetic studies and a real-world case study of
primary seat-belt laws using Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset.
Together, these results indicate that the proposed learners deliver reliable
and sample-efficient HTE estimates in FD scenarios. The implementation is
available at https://github.com/yonghanjung/FD-CATE.

Conclusion: 提出的参数化Gromov-Wasserstein距离框架为分析参数化网络数据提供了统一有效的工具，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce a general framework for analyzing data modeled as parameterized
families of networks. Building on a Gromov-Wasserstein variant of optimal
transport, we define a family of parameterized Gromov-Wasserstein distances for
comparing such parametric data, including time-varying metric spaces induced by
collective motion, temporally evolving weighted social networks, and random
graph models. We establish foundational properties of these distances, showing
that they subsume several existing metrics in the literature, and derive
theoretical approximation guarantees. In particular, we develop computationally
tractable lower bounds and relate them to graph statistics commonly used in
random graph theory. Furthermore, we prove that our distances can be
consistently approximated in random graph and random metric space settings via
empirical estimates from generative models. Finally, we demonstrate the
practical utility of our framework through a series of numerical experiments.

Conclusion: 新算法在较弱假设下仍能恢复潜在因果特征到等价类，为因果表示学习提供了更实用的解决方案，并展示了在AI中整合因果关系的潜力。

Abstract: Causal representation learning (CRL) has garnered increasing interests from
the causal inference and artificial intelligence community, due to its
capability of disentangling potentially complex data-generating mechanism into
causally interpretable latent features, by leveraging the heterogeneity of
modern datasets. In this paper, we further contribute to the CRL literature, by
focusing on the stylized linear structural causal model over the latent
features and assuming a linear mixing function that maps latent features to the
observed data or measurements. Existing linear CRL methods often rely on
stringent assumptions, such as accessibility to single-node interventional data
or restrictive distributional constraints on latent features and exogenous
measurement noise. However, these prerequisites can be challenging to satisfy
in certain scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel linear CRL algorithm
that, unlike most existing linear CRL methods, operates under weaker
assumptions about environment heterogeneity and data-generating distributions
while still recovering latent causal features up to an equivalence class. We
further validate our new algorithm via synthetic experiments and an
interpretability analysis of large language models (LLMs), demonstrating both
its superiority over competing methods in finite samples and its potential in
integrating causality into AI.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which learns a reward
model from human preference data and then optimizes a policy to favor preferred
responses, has emerged as a central paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. In this paper, we investigate exploration
principles for online RLHF, where one seeks to adaptively collect new
preference data to refine both the reward model and the policy in a
data-efficient manner. By examining existing optimism-based exploration
algorithms, we identify a drawback in their sampling protocol: they tend to
gather comparisons that fail to reduce the most informative uncertainties in
reward differences, and we prove lower bounds showing that such methods can
incur linear regret over exponentially long horizons. Motivated by this
insight, we propose a new exploration scheme that directs preference queries
toward reducing uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policy
improvement. Under a multi-armed bandit model of RLHF, we establish regret
bounds of order $T^{(\beta+1)/(\beta+2)}$, where $\beta>0$ is a hyperparameter
that balances reward maximization against mitigating distribution shift. To our
knowledge, this is the first online RLHF algorithm with regret scaling
polynomially in all model parameters.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个系统框架来评估白盒监控器的真实性能，避免因行为诱导信息泄露导致的性能虚高。通过内容过滤、分数过滤和微调模型生物三种策略，在欺骗检测案例中验证了监控器性能的下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 白盒监控器在检测大语言模型有害行为方面具有优势，但训练和评估过程中行为诱导信息会泄露到监控数据中，导致性能评估虚高。需要开发能评估监控器真实检测能力的方法。

Method: 提出三种评估策略：内容过滤（移除输入中的欺骗相关文本）、分数过滤（仅聚合任务相关token的分数）、提示蒸馏微调模型生物（训练模型无需显式提示即可展现欺骗行为）。在多个欺骗检测基准上进行实验。

Result: 实验发现：内容过滤能平滑移除诱导信号，使探针AUROC降低30%；分数过滤使AUROC降低15%；微调模型生物虽然改进了监控器评估，但即使重新训练，性能仍下降高达40%。识别出两种泄露形式：诱导泄露和推理泄露。

Conclusion: 当前白盒监控器的性能评估存在显著虚高问题，提出的三种策略能有效揭示真实性能。内容过滤是最有效的缓解策略，而微调模型生物虽然改进了评估方法但显著降低了监控器性能。

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented
nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical
expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges
limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of
scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for
addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph
(KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG
provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while
AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language
interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these
components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate
data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant
datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate
that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic
workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further
supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can
evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward
democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible,

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in
marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The
electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by
providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this
research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior
by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa
dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models,
the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning
models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and
compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a
comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such
as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the
difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results
did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally
performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not
satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and
machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of
consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the
machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the
EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models
which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

TL;DR: 提出可解释的多模态AI框架MultiFIX，整合临床变量和CT影像进行生存分析，在头颈癌数据集上表现优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态数据的增长和临床对透明模型的需求增加，需要准确且可解释的生存分析方法来支持验证和信任

Method: 使用深度学习推断生存相关特征，通过Grad-CAM解释影像特征，通过遗传编程建模临床变量为符号表达式，采用透明Cox回归进行风险估计

Result: 在头颈癌RADCURE数据集上，MultiFIX获得C-index 0.838（预测）和0.826（分层），优于临床和学术基线方法

Conclusion: MultiFIX展示了可解释多模态AI在精准肿瘤学中的潜力

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in
oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent
models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity.
We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival
analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our
MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features
that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM,
while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic
programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling
stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the
open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a
C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the
clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic
markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for
precision oncology with MultiFIX.

TL;DR: 提出基于GRPO的框架，通过多语言预训练、有限配对数据微调和GRPO优化，实现低资源语言的文本到语音合成，显著优于仅微调方法，并在高资源语言中也表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言的文本到语音合成面临配对数据稀缺的挑战，而自动语音识别模型相对更易获得，因此利用ASR等预训练模型来优化TTS系统。

Method: 1. 使用IPA标记训练多语言TTS基线模型；2. 用有限配对数据微调以捕捉目标语言韵律特征；3. 应用GRPO，仅使用非配对文本和说话人提示，通过ASR、说话人验证和音频质量评估模型的多目标奖励进行优化。

Result: 在低资源语言中生成可理解且说话人一致的语音，显著优于仅微调方法；在高资源语言中也超越DPO等离线对齐方法，在可理解性、说话人相似性和音频质量方面表现更优。

Conclusion: GRPO框架能有效利用ASR等预训练模型优化TTS系统，在低资源和高资源语言中均取得优异性能，为低资源语言TTS合成提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource
languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In
contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are
often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts.
We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method
first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training
a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens.
Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to
capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to
optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a
multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio
quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces
intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages,
substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based
framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing
offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding
superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出RoT方法，通过检索和重用先前的推理步骤作为可组合的"思维"模块来指导新问题，显著提高推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通过生成长推理轨迹来提高准确性，但这会增加延迟和成本，因此需要在推理时提高效率

Method: RoT将推理步骤组织成具有顺序和语义边的思维图，通过检索查询相关节点和应用奖励引导遍历来组装问题特定的模板

Result: RoT在保持准确性的同时，输出token减少高达40%，推理延迟降低82%，成本降低59%

Conclusion: RoT通过检索动态构建模板，为高效的大型推理模型推理建立了可扩展的范式

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces,
but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We
propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable
``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought
graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible
recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies
reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides
generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and,
therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on
reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage,
latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial
efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference
latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a
scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction
through retrieval.

TL;DR: 提出LLR-BC框架，解决神经VRP求解器在终身学习场景中的灾难性遗忘问题，通过行为整合方法保持旧任务性能同时学习新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经求解器在遇到新任务时，要么依赖零样本泛化（性能可能较差），要么需要微调（可能导致灾难性遗忘），缺乏有效的终身学习能力。

Method: 提出LLR-BC框架，通过决策导向的行为整合方法，将新任务训练的求解器行为与缓冲区中的旧任务行为对齐，并对低置信度决策赋予更大权重。

Result: 在容量约束车辆路径问题和旅行商问题上的实验表明，LLR-BC能有效训练高性能神经求解器，解决灾难性遗忘，保持可塑性，提升零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLR-BC为神经VRP求解器提供了一种有效的终身学习范式，能够在多任务序列中持续学习而不遗忘先前知识。

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to
solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on
one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and
scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either
zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between
the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on
the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge
acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning
paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse
distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to
effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their
performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called
Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed.
LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the
solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way.
To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater
consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments
on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems
demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers
in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue,
maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究比较了统计参数映射(SPM)和可解释机器学习方法在足底压力数据异常检测中的表现，发现机器学习模型在准确性上优于SPM，而两种方法在可解释性方面都被专家认为是清晰、有用和可信的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足底压力映射在临床诊断和运动科学中很重要，但大型异构数据集常包含技术错误或程序不一致导致的异常值。SPM提供可解释分析但对对齐敏感，其稳健异常检测能力尚不清楚。

Method: 使用来自多个中心的数据，通过专家共识标注并添加合成异常，共798个有效样本和2000个异常值。评估了(i)非参数、配准依赖的SPM方法和(ii)使用SHAP解释的卷积神经网络(CNN)。

Result: ML模型达到高准确率并优于SPM，SPM误分类了临床有意义的变异并漏检了真实异常。专家认为SPM和SHAP解释都清晰、有用且可信，但SPM被认为复杂度较低。

Conclusion: SPM和可解释ML在足底压力数据自动异常检测中具有互补潜力，可解释性在将复杂模型输出转化为可解释见解以有效支持决策方面至关重要。

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports
science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical
errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity
for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM
approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish
transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from
multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic
anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a
non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional
neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a
semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high
accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful
variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP
explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less
complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and
explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar
pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating
complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文表明反转诅咒不是语言模型的固有缺陷，而是知识编码方式的产物。通过在关系知识图谱上训练，模型会形成双线性关系结构，这能显著缓解反转诅咒并支持一致的模型编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究反转诅咒（模型无法从已学事实"A是B"推断反向事实"B是A"）的根本原因，探索这是否是语言模型的固有局限。

Method: 从零开始在合成的关系知识图谱数据集上训练语言模型，分析其隐藏表示中出现的双线性关系结构。

Result: 训练出的模型在隐藏表示中形成了双线性关系结构，这显著缓解了反转诅咒，使模型能够推断未见过的反向事实。该结构还支持一致的模型编辑，编辑一个事实会正确传播到其反向和其他逻辑相关事实。

Conclusion: 反转诅咒不是语言模型的固有缺陷，而是知识表示方式的产物。关系知识训练会诱导双线性内部表示的出现，这使得语言模型在编辑后能保持逻辑一致性。模型编辑的成功不仅取决于编辑算法，还取决于被修改知识的底层表示几何结构。

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen
fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a
fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an
artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a
synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear
relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure
substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen
reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key
role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this
structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically
dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only
suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further
introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a
relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal
representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent
manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends
critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying
representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GSM-Agent基准测试，评估LLM在解决需要主动收集信息的简单数学问题时的代理推理能力，发现即使是前沿模型准确率也只有67%，并提出了基于代理推理图的改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试往往将代理推理与复杂的数学推理、专业知识等能力混在一起，难以单独评估代理推理能力，因此需要构建一个专门评估代理推理的基准。

Method: 构建GSM-Agent基准，要求LLM解决小学水平的数学问题，但只提供问题而不提供前提信息，需要主动使用工具收集必要信息。提出代理推理图概念来分析推理模式，并开发工具增强的测试时扩展方法来改进性能。

Result: 即使是GPT-5这样的前沿模型在GSM-Agent基准上也只能达到67%的准确率。分析发现许多模型缺乏重新访问先前节点的能力，这是静态推理中的关键模式。

Conclusion: GSM-Agent基准和代理推理框架有助于未来理解和推进代理推理能力的研究边界，提出的方法能够有效改进LLM的代理推理性能。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability
to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical
skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in
complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic
reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other
advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,
where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,
but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that
contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively
collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are
grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5
only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning
patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the
environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its
nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the
ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern
in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.
Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to
improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models
to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid
future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic
reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文主张在机器学习评估中应明确考虑标注不确定性，使用直接操作分布的概率度量，而非简单的多数投票等聚合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床数据集的标注很少是确定的，因为标注者之间存在分歧且置信度不统一。传统的聚合方法（如多数投票）掩盖了这种变异性，在医学影像基准测试中，考虑二元标签的置信度显著影响模型排名。

Method: 提出使用概率度量来明确处理标注不确定性，这些度量可以直接操作分布，适用于各种标注生成过程（简单计数、主观置信度评级或概率响应模型），并且计算轻量，一旦按模型分数排序示例，具有线性时间实现的闭式表达式。

Result: 在医学影像基准测试的简单实验中，考虑二元标签的置信度显著影响模型排名，表明传统评估方法可能产生误导性的性能估计。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区发布数据集的原始标注并采用不确定性感知评估，使性能估计能更好地反映临床数据的实际情况。

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PD-SSM方法，通过结构化稀疏参数化状态转移矩阵，在保持计算效率的同时提升状态空间模型的表达能力，能够最优地模拟有限状态自动机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有状态空间模型使用对角化转移矩阵虽然计算高效，但表达能力受限；非结构化转移矩阵虽然表达能力最优但计算成本过高。需要一种既能保持计算效率又能提升表达能力的方法。

Method: 将转移矩阵参数化为列独热矩阵(P)和复值对角矩阵(D)的乘积(PD-SSM)，使并行扫描的计算成本与状态大小呈线性关系。

Result: 理论上模型BIBO稳定，能够用一层维度N和线性读出层模拟任何N状态FSA；实验表明在FSA状态跟踪任务上优于多种现代SSM变体，在时间序列分类上与神经控制微分方程性能相当。

Conclusion: PD-SSM在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了状态空间模型的表达能力，能够有效跟踪复杂FSA状态，为混合Transformer-SSM架构提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which
enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity,
as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA).
While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity,
they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate
state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition
matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and
depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to
that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix
as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal
matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales
linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can
emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout
of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM
guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide
collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On
multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of
neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for
time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid
Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively
track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of
variable-length English sentences. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统基于基准测试的评估方法成本高且需要人工设计任务，无法有效评估语言模型代理在真实世界工具使用中的通用能力。

Method: 开发EELMA算法，通过计算代理行为与未来状态之间的互信息来估计赋权值，在多轮文本交互中近似有效赋权。

Result: 赋权值与平均任务表现强相关，能表征环境复杂性、思维链、模型规模和记忆长度等因素的影响，高赋权状态往往是关键能力时刻。

Conclusion: 赋权作为通用指标，适合在复杂开放环境中评估和监控语言模型代理的能力。

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to
real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of
agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are
costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that
translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we
propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual
information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended
method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of
Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment
from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and
scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly
correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of
environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model
scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment
states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.
Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose
metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework
designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments,
including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and
evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus
input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character
recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a
retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers,
and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with
explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems
that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by
incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading
trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent
evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback
cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively
working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

Motivation: 理解LLM复杂推理机制及其失败原因，为可解释性研究提供可测量的几何分析视角。

Method: 定义推理流形概念，构建REMA框架，通过计算错误表示与正确表示流形的k近邻距离来量化几何偏差，并追踪层间偏差变化定位分歧点。

Result: 实验验证推理流形的低维特性，错误与正确推理表示的高度可分性，REMA框架能有效分析推理失败起源。

Conclusion: 将抽象推理失败与表示中的可测量几何偏差联系起来，为理解黑盒模型内部计算过程提供新途径。

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and
their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To
provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of
the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by
the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned
generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the
effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a
given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the
origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of
internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct
reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation
of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors
distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,
thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence
points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this
deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline
of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where
the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on
diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the
low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability
between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also
validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of
reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to
measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for
in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of
black-box models.

TL;DR: 提出了动态专家搜索（DES），一种测试时缩放策略，通过控制MoE模型中激活的专家数量来生成多样化的推理轨迹，提升推理能力而不增加额外成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法主要依赖输出级采样，忽视了模型架构的作用。在MoE模型中，发现改变激活专家数量能产生互补的解决方案集，这揭示了新的多样性来源。

Method: DES包含两个关键组件：动态MoE（在推理时直接控制专家数量生成多样化推理轨迹）和专家配置继承（在推理路径内保持一致的专家数量，在运行间变化以平衡稳定性和多样性）。

Result: 在MoE架构、验证器和推理基准（数学、代码和知识）上的广泛实验表明，DES可靠地优于TTS基线，在不增加成本的情况下提高了准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: DES作为一种实用且可扩展的架构感知TTS形式，展示了现代LLM中结构灵活性如何推进推理能力的发展。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文通过图论抽象分析强化学习在LLM规划中的理论机制，发现SFT会产生伪相关解，而RL通过探索实现正确规划，但PG存在多样性崩溃问题，Q学习则能保持多样性并避免奖励黑客。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL方法显著提升了LLM的规划能力，但其有效性的理论基础尚不明确，需要系统分析RL在规划任务中的优势和局限。

Method: 采用可处理的图论抽象模型，重点分析策略梯度(PG)和Q学习方法，并在Blocksworld实际规划基准上进行验证。

Result: 理论分析表明：SFT会产生基于共现的伪相关解；RL通过探索实现更好的泛化；PG存在多样性崩溃问题；Q学习能保持多样性且避免奖励黑客。

Conclusion: RL通过探索机制在规划任务中优于SFT，但需要仔细选择RL算法和奖励设计，Q学习在保持多样性和避免奖励黑客方面优于策略梯度方法。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.

### [318] [Comparative Analysis of GAN and Diffusion for MRI-to-CT translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22049)
*Emily Honey,Anders Helbo,Jens Petersen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 比较两种MRI到CT图像转换架构（cGAN和cDDPM）的性能，发现cDDPM在多通道条件输入下表现更优，并提出了评估切片连续性的新指标SIMOS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT图像在治疗和诊断中至关重要，但当CT难以获取时，需要从MRI生成合成CT图像的方法。需要建立参考标准来确定最有效的MRI到CT转换策略。

Method: 使用Pix2Pix代表cGAN架构，Palette代表cDDPM架构，将3D转换问题分解为2D横向切片序列。研究单切片和多切片条件输入的影响，并使用包括新指标SIMOS在内的全面评估协议。

Result: 比较分析显示，MRI到CT生成模型受益于多通道条件输入，且cDDPM架构表现更好。

Conclusion: cDDPM架构在多通道条件输入下对MRI到CT转换任务更有效，提出的SIMOS指标能有效评估3D合成CT的切片连续性。

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is essential for treatment and diagnostics; In case
CT are missing or otherwise difficult to obtain, methods for generating
synthetic CT (sCT) images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are
sought after. Therefore, it is valuable to establish a reference for what
strategies are most effective for MRI-to-CT translation. In this paper, we
compare the performance of two frequently used architectures for MRI-to-CT
translation: a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) and a
conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (cDDPM). We chose
well-established implementations to represent each architecture: Pix2Pix for
cGAN, and Palette for cDDPM. We separate the classical 3D translation problem
into a sequence of 2D translations on the transverse plane, to investigate the
viability of a strategy that reduces the computational cost. We also
investigate the impact of conditioning the generative process on a single MRI
image/slice and on multiple MRI slices. The performance is assessed using a
thorough evaluation protocol, including a novel slice-wise metric Similarity Of
Slices (SIMOS), which measures the continuity between transverse slices when
compiling the sCTs into 3D format. Our comparative analysis revealed that
MRI-to-CT generative models benefit from multi-channel conditional input and
using cDDPM as an architecture.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个用于医学图像分割的度量不确定性量化框架，通过在模型的表示空间中进行校准，生成更紧凑的置信区间，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学应用中，分割模型的效用通常基于下游度量（如器官大小）的准确性，而非像素级分割精度。因此，对这些度量进行不确定性量化对决策至关重要。

Method: COMPASS框架在模型的表示空间中进行校准，通过沿着对目标度量最敏感的低维子空间扰动中间特征，避免了将复杂的分割到度量管道视为黑盒的低效方法。

Result: 在四个医学图像分割任务上，COMPASS产生的区间比传统CP基线显著更紧凑，并且在协变量偏移下也能恢复目标覆盖。

Conclusion: COMPASS为医学图像分割提供了实用的、基于度量的不确定性量化方法，通过利用深度学习模型的归纳偏置实现了更高效的置信区间生成。

Abstract: In clinical applications, the utility of segmentation models is often based
on the accuracy of derived downstream metrics such as organ size, rather than
by the pixel-level accuracy of the segmentation masks themselves. Thus,
uncertainty quantification for such metrics is crucial for decision-making.
Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular framework to derive such principled
uncertainty guarantees, but applying CP naively to the final scalar metric is
inefficient because it treats the complex, non-linear segmentation-to-metric
pipeline as a black box. We introduce COMPASS, a practical framework that
generates efficient, metric-based CP intervals for image segmentation models by
leveraging the inductive biases of their underlying deep neural networks.
COMPASS performs calibration directly in the model's representation space by
perturbing intermediate features along low-dimensional subspaces maximally
sensitive to the target metric. We prove that COMPASS achieves valid marginal
coverage under exchangeability and nestedness assumptions. Empirically, we
demonstrate that COMPASS produces significantly tighter intervals than
traditional CP baselines on four medical image segmentation tasks for area
estimation of skin lesions and anatomical structures. Furthermore, we show that
leveraging learned internal features to estimate importance weights allows
COMPASS to also recover target coverage under covariate shifts. COMPASS paves
the way for practical, metric-based uncertainty quantification for medical
image segmentation.

TL;DR: 本文修正了Krovi量子Schur变换算法的错误，并详细分析了高维版本的BCH Schur变换，填补了文献中的关键空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子Schur变换是基础量子算法，但自2005年BCH论文以来，某些方面仍未充分理解，且Krovi 2018年提出的替代方法存在关键错误。

Method: 提出了Krovi算法的修正版本，并详细处理了高维BCH Schur变换，使两种变换在量子比特数n小于局部维度d时变得实用。

Result: Krovi算法复杂度为O~(n⁴)，BCH算法复杂度为O~(min(n⁵,nd⁴))，为依赖Schur-Weyl对偶性的量子信息理论结果提供了更强算法基础。

Conclusion: 这项工作加强了量子信息理论和量子计算中依赖Schur-Weyl对偶性的广泛结果的算法基础。

Abstract: The quantum Schur transform has become a foundational quantum algorithm, yet
even after two decades since the seminal 2005 paper by Bacon, Chuang, and
Harrow (BCH), some aspects of the transform remain insufficiently understood.
Moreover, an alternative approach proposed by Krovi in 2018 was recently found
to contain a crucial error. In this paper, we present a corrected version of
Krovi's algorithm along with a detailed treatment of the high-dimensional
version of the BCH Schur transform. This high-dimensional focus makes the two
versions of the transform practical for regimes where the number of qudits $n$
is smaller than the local dimension $d$, with Krovi's algorithm scaling as
$\widetilde{O}(n^4)$ and BCH as $\widetilde{O}(\min(n^5,nd^4))$. Our work
addresses a key gap in the literature, strengthening the algorithmic
foundations of a wide range of results that rely on Schur--Weyl duality in
quantum information theory and quantum computation.

Conclusion: 该混合方法能够有效优化量子嵌入，为量子机器学习在复杂数据分类任务中的应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Classification using variational quantum circuits is a promising frontier in
quantum machine learning. Quantum supervised learning (QSL) applied to
classical data using variational quantum circuits involves embedding the data
into a quantum Hilbert space and optimizing the circuit parameters to train the
measurement process. In this context, the efficacy of QSL is inherently
influenced by the selection of quantum embedding. In this study, we introduce a
classical-quantum hybrid approach for optimizing quantum embedding beyond the
limitations of the standard circuit model of quantum computation (i.e.,
completely positive and trace-preserving maps) for general multi-channel data.
We benchmark the performance of various models in our framework using the
CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets and provide theoretical analyses that guide
model design and optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了ConQuER框架，通过模块化电路架构解决IQP量子生成模型的两个关键限制：输出可控性不足和生成偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于IQP电路的量子生成模型存在两个主要问题：缺乏对生成输出的控制能力，以及严重的生成偏差（偏向某些预期模式）。

Method: ConQuER采用模块化电路架构，嵌入轻量级控制器电路，可直接与预训练的IQP电路结合，无需完全重新训练即可精确控制输出分布。还通过数据驱动优化在底层IQP架构中嵌入隐式控制路径。

Result: 在多个量子状态数据集上的实验验证表明，ConQuER具有优越的控制精度和平衡的生成性能，仅比原始IQP电路增加极低的开销成本。

Conclusion: ConQuER框架弥合了量子计算优势与可控生成建模实际需求之间的差距，保持了高效经典训练特性和高可扩展性。

Abstract: Quantum generative models based on instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP)
circuits show great promise in learning complex distributions while maintaining
classical trainability. However, current implementations suffer from two key
limitations: lack of controllability over generated outputs and severe
generation bias towards certain expected patterns. We present a Controllable
Quantum Generative Framework, ConQuER, which addresses both challenges through
a modular circuit architecture. ConQuER embeds a lightweight controller circuit
that can be directly combined with pre-trained IQP circuits to precisely
control the output distribution without full retraining. Leveraging the
advantages of IQP, our scheme enables precise control over properties such as
the Hamming Weight distribution with minimal parameter and gate overhead. In
addition, inspired by the controller design, we extend this modular approach
through data-driven optimization to embed implicit control paths in the
underlying IQP architecture, significantly reducing generation bias on
structured datasets. ConQuER retains efficient classical training properties
and high scalability. We experimentally validate ConQuER on multiple quantum
state datasets, demonstrating its superior control accuracy and balanced
generation performance, only with very low overhead cost over original IQP
circuits. Our framework bridges the gap between the advantages of quantum
computing and the practical needs of controllable generation modeling.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了基于循环闭合的信息拓扑框架，认为记忆和意识源于神经状态空间中潜在循环的重新进入能力，其中不变循环通过过滤噪声和保持跨情境持久性来承载意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统记忆模型将记忆视为静态存储，本文旨在建立动态循环机制作为记忆和意识的基础，解释大脑如何在非遍历环境中实现泛化。

Method: 使用信息拓扑框架，提出点-循环二分法：瞬时点支撑探索，非平凡循环编码低熵内容不变量。通过多时序神经群实现1-循环，嵌套在θ-γ节律中，形成层次化微循环结构。

Result: 建立了感知-行动循环的高阶不变性，通过层-余层对偶形式化全局感知片段整合和行动计划分解的过程，循环闭合使自上而下预测与自下而上循环对齐。

Conclusion: 循环是记忆和意识的核心机制，持久不变量在非遍历环境中以最小能量成本实现长期一致性，支持泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose an information-topological framework in which cycle closure is the
fundamental mechanism of memory and consciousness. Memory is not a static store
but the ability to re-enter latent cycles in neural state space, with invariant
cycles serving as carriers of meaning by filtering order-specific noise and
preserving what persists across contexts. The dot-cycle dichotomy captures
this: transient dots scaffold exploration, while nontrivial cycles encode
low-entropy content invariants that stabilize memory. Biologically,
polychronous neural groups realize 1-cycles through delay-locked spiking
reinforced by STDP, nested within theta-gamma rhythms that enforce boundary
cancellation. These micro-cycles compose hierarchically, extending navigation
loops into general memory and cognition. The perception-action cycle introduces
high-order invariance: closure holds even across sense-act alternations,
generalizing ancestral homing behavior. Sheaf-cosheaf duality formalizes this
process: sheaves glue perceptual fragments into global sections, cosheaves
decompose global plans into actions and closure aligns top-down predictions
with bottom-up cycles. Consciousness then arises as the persistence of
high-order invariants that integrate (unity) yet differentiate (richness)
across contexts. We conclude that cycle is all you need: persistent invariants
enable generalization in non-ergodic environments with long-term coherence at
minimal energetic cost.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种符号化代理建模方法，通过语义保持特征分区和多群体遗传程序，从Transformer嵌入中学习紧凑、可审计的分类器，并实现概率校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究符号化代理建模的目的是获得紧凑、可审计的分类器，同时具有校准的概率，以便更好地理解和解释模型决策。

Method: 使用语义保持特征分区(SPFP)将Transformer嵌入划分为不相交的信息保持视图，然后通过多群体遗传程序(MEGP)学习这些视图上的加法闭式对数程序。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，生成的代理模型实现了强大的判别能力（MNIST、CIFAR10、MSC17的F1约0.99，SST2G约0.95），并通过温度缩放显著降低了预期校准误差。

Conclusion: 该方法能够产生忠实、跨模态的解释，基于明确的程序，展示了符号化代理建模在获得可解释且校准良好的分类器方面的有效性。

Abstract: We study symbolic surrogate modeling of frozen Transformer embeddings to
obtain compact, auditable classifiers with calibrated probabilities. For five
benchmarks (SST2G, 20NG, MNIST, CIFAR10, MSC17), embeddings from ModernBERT,
DINOv2, and SigLIP are partitioned on the training set into disjoint,
information-preserving views via semantic-preserving feature partitioning
(SPFP). A cooperative multi-population genetic program (MEGP) then learns
additive, closed-form logit programs over these views. Across 30 runs per
dataset we report F1, AUC, log-loss, Brier, expected calibration error (ECE),
and symbolic complexity; a canonical model is chosen by a one-standard-error
rule on validation F1 with a parsimony tie-break. Temperature scaling fitted on
validation yields substantial ECE reductions on test. The resulting surrogates
achieve strong discrimination (up to F1 around 0.99 on MNIST, CIFAR10, MSC17;
around 0.95 on SST2G), while 20NG remains most challenging. We provide
reliability diagrams, dimension usage and overlap statistics,
contribution-based importances, and global effect profiles (PDP and ALE),
demonstrating faithful, cross-modal explanations grounded in explicit programs.

Conclusion: SGNNBench填补了SGNN领域缺乏系统性基准的空白，为促进通用SGNN范式的发展提供了重要工具和见解。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are exemplary deep models designed for graph
data. Message passing mechanism enables GNNs to effectively capture graph
topology and push the performance boundaries across various graph tasks.
However, the trend of developing such complex machinery for graph
representation learning has become unsustainable on large-scale graphs. The
computational and time overhead make it imperative to develop more
energy-efficient GNNs to cope with the explosive growth of real-world graphs.
Spiking Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), which integrate biologically plausible
learning via unique spike-based neurons, have emerged as a promising
energy-efficient alternative. Different layers communicate with sparse and
binary spikes, which facilitates computation and storage of intermediate graph
representations. Despite the proliferation of SGNNs proposed in recent years,
there is no systematic benchmark to explore the basic design principles of
these brain-inspired networks on the graph data. To bridge this gap, we present
SGNNBench to quantify progress in the field of SGNNs. Specifically, SGNNBench
conducts an in-depth investigation of SGNNs from multiple perspectives,
including effectiveness, energy efficiency, and architectural design. We
comprehensively evaluate 9 state-of-the-art SGNNs across 18 datasets. Regarding
efficiency, we empirically compare these baselines w.r.t model size, memory
usage, and theoretical energy consumption to reveal the often-overlooked energy
bottlenecks of SGNNs. Besides, we elaborately investigate the design space of
SGNNs to promote the development of a general SGNN paradigm.

TL;DR: TIFNet是一种基于Transformer的台风强度预测模型，通过整合高分辨率全球预报和历史演变融合机制，生成非迭代的5天强度轨迹，在快速增强和减弱等极端情况下显著优于传统数值模型。

Motivation: 热带气旋强度预测，特别是在快速增强和减弱期间，对灾害准备和基础设施韧性至关重要。现有机器学习系统在极端情况下预测性能下降且缺乏长期一致性。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的架构，整合高分辨率全球预报和历史演变融合机制，生成非迭代的5天强度轨迹。模型在再分析数据上训练，并在业务数据上进行微调。

Result: TIFNet在所有预报时效上都优于业务数值模型，在弱、强和超强台风类别中均表现稳健。在快速强度变化情况下，预报误差比当前业务基准降低29-43%。

Conclusion: TIFNet代表了人工智能在台风强度预测领域的重大进步，特别是在传统模型表现不佳的极端条件下表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclone (TC) intensity - particularly during
periods of rapid intensification and rapid weakening - remains a challenge for
operational meteorology, with high-stakes implications for disaster
preparedness and infrastructure resilience. Recent advances in machine learning
have yielded notable progress in TC prediction; however, most existing systems
provide forecasts that degrade rapidly in extreme regimes and lack long-range
consistency. Here we introduce TIFNet, a transformer-based forecasting model
that generates non-iterative, 5-day intensity trajectories by integrating
high-resolution global forecasts with a historical-evolution fusion mechanism.
Trained on reanalysis data and fine-tuned with operational data, TIFNet
consistently outperforms operational numerical models across all forecast
horizons, delivering robust improvements across weak, strong, and super typhoon
categories. In rapid intensity change regimes - long regarded as the most
difficult to forecast - TIFNet reduces forecast error by 29-43% relative to
current operational baselines. These results represent a substantial advance in
artificial-intelligence-based TC intensity forecasting, especially under
extreme conditions where traditional models consistently underperform.

Result: 在多个CRS基准测试中，ReGeS在推荐准确性方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 检索与生成的相互协同对于知识密集型CRS任务非常有效，能够减少幻觉、简化持续更新，且无需额外标注。

Abstract: Connecting conversation with external domain knowledge is vital for
conversational recommender systems (CRS) to correctly understand user
preferences. However, existing solutions either require domain-specific
engineering, which limits flexibility, or rely solely on large language models,
which increases the risk of hallucination. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) holds promise, its naive use in CRS is hindered by noisy dialogues that
weaken retrieval and by overlooked nuances among similar items. We propose
ReGeS, a reciprocal Retrieval-Generation Synergy framework that unifies
generation-augmented retrieval to distill informative user intent from
conversations and retrieval-augmented generation to differentiate subtle item
features. This synergy obviates the need for extra annotations, reduces
hallucinations, and simplifies continuous updates. Experiments on multiple CRS
benchmarks show that ReGeS achieves state-of-the-art performance in
recommendation accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of reciprocal synergy
for knowledge-intensive CRS tasks.

Conclusion: SmartDJ框架成功实现了声明式立体声音频编辑，通过结合语言模型推理和扩散生成能力，提供了更自然和高质量的音频编辑体验。

Abstract: Audio editing plays a central role in VR/AR immersion, virtual conferencing,
sound design, and other interactive media. However, recent generative audio
editing models depend on template-like instruction formats and are restricted
to mono-channel audio. These models fail to deal with declarative audio
editing, where the user declares what the desired outcome should be, while
leaving the details of editing operations to the system. We introduce SmartDJ,
a novel framework for stereo audio editing that combines the reasoning
capability of audio language models with the generative power of latent
diffusion. Given a high-level instruction, SmartDJ decomposes it into a
sequence of atomic edit operations, such as adding, removing, or spatially
relocating events. These operations are then executed by a diffusion model
trained to manipulate stereo audio. To support this, we design a data synthesis
pipeline that produces paired examples of high-level instructions, atomic edit
operations, and audios before and after each edit operation. Experiments
demonstrate that SmartDJ achieves superior perceptual quality, spatial realism,
and semantic alignment compared to prior audio editing methods. Demos are
available at https://zitonglan.github.io/project/smartdj/smartdj.html.

Abstract: Automatic drum transcription (ADT) is traditionally formulated as a
discriminative task to predict drum events from audio spectrograms. In this
work, we redefine ADT as a conditional generative task and introduce
Noise-to-Notes (N2N), a framework leveraging diffusion modeling to transform
audio-conditioned Gaussian noise into drum events with associated velocities.
This generative diffusion approach offers distinct advantages, including a
flexible speed-accuracy trade-off and strong inpainting capabilities. However,
the generation of binary onset and continuous velocity values presents a
challenge for diffusion models, and to overcome this, we introduce an Annealed
Pseudo-Huber loss to facilitate effective joint optimization. Finally, to
augment low-level spectrogram features, we propose incorporating features
extracted from music foundation models (MFMs), which capture high-level
semantic information and enhance robustness to out-of-domain drum audio.
Experimental results demonstrate that including MFM features significantly
improves robustness and N2N establishes a new state-of-the-art performance
across multiple ADT benchmarks.

Abstract: Learning a control policy for a multi-phase, long-horizon task, such as
basketball maneuvers, remains challenging for reinforcement learning approaches
due to the need for seamless policy composition and transitions between skills.
A long-horizon task typically consists of distinct subtasks with well-defined
goals, separated by transitional subtasks with unclear goals but critical to
the success of the entire task. Existing methods like the mixture of experts
and skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share
significant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal
states between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy
integration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor
skills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states.
Based on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless
and robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set
of fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions. Policies trained
by our approach can effectively control the simulated character to interact
with the ball and accomplish the long-horizon task specified by real-time user
commands, without relying on ball trajectory references.

### [332] [MobiLLM: An Agentic AI Framework for Closed-Loop Threat Mitigation in 6G Open RANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21634)
*Prakhar Sharma,Haohuang Wen,Vinod Yegneswaran,Ashish Gehani,Phillip Porras,Zhiqiang Lin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了MobiLLM框架，这是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体系统，用于6G O-RAN环境中的自动化端到端威胁缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G O-RAN的开放性虽然促进了创新，但也扩大了攻击面，而传统防御措施是反应式的、劳动密集型的，无法应对下一代系统的规模和复杂性。

Method: 使用模块化多智能体系统，包括威胁分析智能体（实时数据分类）、威胁分类智能体（使用RAG将异常映射到对策）和威胁响应智能体（通过O-RAN控制接口安全执行缓解措施）。

Result: 初步评估表明，MobiLLM能有效识别和协调复杂缓解策略，显著降低响应延迟，展示了6G中自主安全操作的可行性。

Conclusion: MobiLLM为可信赖的AI驱动网络安全提供了蓝图，基于MITRE FiGHT框架和3GPP规范等可信知识库，并配备强大的安全防护措施。

Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks is being accelerated by the Open Radio
Access Network (O-RAN) paradigm -- an open, interoperable architecture that
enables intelligent, modular applications across public telecom and private
enterprise domains. While this openness creates unprecedented opportunities for
innovation, it also expands the attack surface, demanding resilient, low-cost,
and autonomous security solutions. Legacy defenses remain largely reactive,
labor-intensive, and inadequate for the scale and complexity of next-generation
systems. Current O-RAN applications focus mainly on network optimization or
passive threat detection, with limited capability for closed-loop, automated
response.
  To address this critical gap, we present an agentic AI framework for fully
automated, end-to-end threat mitigation in 6G O-RAN environments. MobiLLM
orchestrates security workflows through a modular multi-agent system powered by
Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework features a Threat Analysis Agent
for real-time data triage, a Threat Classification Agent that uses
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to map anomalies to specific
countermeasures, and a Threat Response Agent that safely operationalizes
mitigation actions via O-RAN control interfaces. Grounded in trusted knowledge
bases such as the MITRE FiGHT framework and 3GPP specifications, and equipped
with robust safety guardrails, MobiLLM provides a blueprint for trustworthy
AI-driven network security. Initial evaluations demonstrate that MobiLLM can
effectively identify and orchestrate complex mitigation strategies,
significantly reducing response latency and showcasing the feasibility of
autonomous security operations in 6G.

*Yue Liu,Yanjie Zhao,Yunbo Lyu,Ting Zhang,Haoyu Wang,David Lo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文首次对高权限AI编程编辑器进行提示注入攻击的实证分析，展示了攻击者如何通过污染外部开发资源来远程利用这些系统，将AI代理变成攻击者的shell。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI编程编辑器的流行，它们拥有更多系统权限来执行复杂编码任务，这虽然提高了开发效率，但也带来了新的安全风险，特别是提示注入攻击的威胁。

Method: 开发了AIShellJack自动化测试框架，包含314个独特攻击载荷，涵盖MITRE ATT&CK框架的70种技术，用于评估AI编程编辑器的提示注入漏洞。

Result: 在GitHub Copilot和Cursor上的大规模评估显示，恶意命令执行的成功率高达84%，攻击在初始访问、系统发现、凭据窃取和数据外泄等广泛目标上都有效。

Conclusion: 高权限AI编程编辑器面临严重的提示注入攻击风险，需要加强安全防护措施来防止AI代理被恶意利用。

Abstract: Agentic AI coding editors driven by large language models have recently
become more popular due to their ability to improve developer productivity
during software development. Modern editors such as Cursor are designed not
just for code completion, but also with more system privileges for complex
coding tasks (e.g., run commands in the terminal, access development
environments, and interact with external systems). While this brings us closer
to the "fully automated programming" dream, it also raises new security
concerns. In this study, we present the first empirical analysis of prompt
injection attacks targeting these high-privilege agentic AI coding editors. We
show how attackers can remotely exploit these systems by poisoning external
development resources with malicious instructions, effectively hijacking AI
agents to run malicious commands, turning "your AI" into "attacker's shell". To
perform this analysis, we implement AIShellJack, an automated testing framework
for assessing prompt injection vulnerabilities in agentic AI coding editors.
AIShellJack contains 314 unique attack payloads that cover 70 techniques from
the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Using AIShellJack, we conduct a large-scale
evaluation on GitHub Copilot and Cursor, and our evaluation results show that
attack success rates can reach as high as 84% for executing malicious commands.
Moreover, these attacks are proven effective across a wide range of objectives,
ranging from initial access and system discovery to credential theft and data
exfiltration.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对使用功能加密进行安全训练的神经网络的攻击方法，使用线性规划重构原始输入，并提出了两种解决方案来确保训练和推理的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习即服务的普及，将敏感数据上传到云端进行训练存在严重的隐私问题。虽然功能加密被用于保护加密数据上的训练，但现有方法存在未考虑的安全漏洞。

Method: 使用线性规划方法重构原始输入，攻击基于功能加密的安全神经网络训练系统。同时提出了两种防御方案：一种是不依赖加密的客户端参与计算方案，另一种是使用函数隐藏内积技术的方案。

Result: 成功展示了针对功能加密安全训练系统的攻击，能够重构原始输入数据，揭示了现有安全承诺的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 当前基于功能加密的机器学习安全训练方法存在安全漏洞，需要采用客户端参与计算或函数隐藏技术等更安全的方案来保护隐私。

Abstract: With the increased interest in artificial intelligence, Machine Learning as a
Service provides the infrastructure in the Cloud for easy training, testing,
and deploying models. However, these systems have a major privacy issue:
uploading sensitive data to the Cloud, especially during training. Therefore,
achieving secure Neural Network training has been on many researchers' minds
lately. More and more solutions for this problem are built around a main
pillar: Functional Encryption (FE). Although these approaches are very
interesting and offer a new perspective on ML training over encrypted data,
some vulnerabilities do not seem to be taken into consideration. In our paper,
we present an attack on neural networks that uses FE for secure training over
encrypted data. Our approach uses linear programming to reconstruct the
original input, unveiling the previous security promises. To address the
attack, we propose two solutions for secure training and inference that involve
the client during the computation phase. One approach ensures security without
relying on encryption, while the other uses function-hiding inner-product
techniques.

### [335] [SBFA: Single Sneaky Bit Flip Attack to Break Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21843)
*Jingkai Guo,Chaitali Chakrabarti,Deliang Fan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SBFA（隐蔽位翻转攻击）是一种针对大语言模型的新型攻击方法，仅需翻转单个比特位就能使模型性能崩溃，同时保持扰动值在良性层间权重分布范围内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位翻转攻击方法通常分别针对整数或浮点数模型，攻击灵活性有限。在浮点数模型中，随机位翻转常导致参数变为极端值，不够隐蔽且可能引发数值运行时错误。

Method: 通过定义的参数敏感度指标ImpactScore（结合梯度敏感性和受良性层间权重分布约束的扰动范围）进行迭代搜索和排序，并提出了轻量级SKIP搜索算法来大幅降低搜索复杂度。

Result: 在Qwen、LLaMA和Gemma模型上，仅翻转单个比特位就能成功将MMLU和SST-2的准确率降至随机水平以下，在BF16和INT8数据格式中均有效。

Conclusion: 仅翻转数十亿参数中的一个比特位就能成功攻击SOTA LLM模型，揭示了严重的安全隐患。

Abstract: Model integrity of Large language models (LLMs) has become a pressing
security concern with their massive online deployment. Prior Bit-Flip Attacks
(BFAs) -- a class of popular AI weight memory fault-injection techniques -- can
severely compromise Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): as few as tens of bit flips
can degrade accuracy toward random guessing. Recent studies extend BFAs to LLMs
and reveal that, despite the intuition of better robustness from modularity and
redundancy, only a handful of adversarial bit flips can also cause LLMs'
catastrophic accuracy degradation. However, existing BFA methods typically
focus on either integer or floating-point models separately, limiting attack
flexibility. Moreover, in floating-point models, random bit flips often cause
perturbed parameters to extreme values (e.g., flipping in exponent bit), making
it not stealthy and leading to numerical runtime error (e.g., invalid tensor
values (NaN/Inf)). In this work, for the first time, we propose SBFA (Sneaky
Bit-Flip Attack), which collapses LLM performance with only one single bit flip
while keeping perturbed values within benign layer-wise weight distribution. It
is achieved through iterative searching and ranking through our defined
parameter sensitivity metric, ImpactScore, which combines gradient sensitivity
and perturbation range constrained by the benign layer-wise weight
distribution. A novel lightweight SKIP searching algorithm is also proposed to
greatly reduce searching complexity, which leads to successful SBFA searching
taking only tens of minutes for SOTA LLMs. Across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma
models, with only one single bit flip, SBFA successfully degrades accuracy to
below random levels on MMLU and SST-2 in both BF16 and INT8 data formats.
Remarkably, flipping a single bit out of billions of parameters reveals a
severe security concern of SOTA LLM models.

### [336] [Seismic Velocity Inversion from Multi-Source Shot Gathers Using Deep Segmentation Networks: Benchmarking U-Net Variants and SeismoLabV3+](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21331)
*Mahedi Hasan*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: 该研究比较了U-Net、U-Net++、DeepLabV3+和优化的SeismoLabV3+四种编码器-解码器架构在地震速度反演中的性能，发现SeismoLabV3+在ThinkOnward 2025数据集上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理驱动的地震速度反演方法计算量大、对初始化敏感且受限于地震数据带宽，需要开发更高效的深度学习方法。

Method: 使用四种编码器-解码器架构（U-Net、U-Net++、DeepLabV3+和SeismoLabV3+）在ThinkOnward 2025数据集上进行地震速度反演，其中SeismoLabV3+是DeepLabV3+的优化变体，采用ResNeXt50 32x4d骨干网络和任务特定修改。

Result: SeismoLabV3+在内部验证集和隐藏测试集上的MAPE值分别为0.03025和0.031246，表现最佳。

Conclusion: 深度分割网络适用于地震速度反演任务，定制化的架构优化对推进地球物理AI模型具有重要意义。

Abstract: Seismic velocity inversion is a key task in geophysical exploration, enabling
the reconstruction of subsurface structures from seismic wave data. It is
critical for high-resolution seismic imaging and interpretation. Traditional
physics-driven methods, such as Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), are
computationally demanding, sensitive to initialization, and limited by the
bandwidth of seismic data. Recent advances in deep learning have led to
data-driven approaches that treat velocity inversion as a dense prediction
task. This research benchmarks three advanced encoder-decoder architectures --
U-Net, U-Net++, and DeepLabV3+ -- together with SeismoLabV3+, an optimized
variant of DeepLabV3+ with a ResNeXt50 32x4d backbone and task-specific
modifications -- for seismic velocity inversion using the ThinkOnward 2025
Speed \& Structure dataset, which consists of five-channel seismic shot gathers
paired with high-resolution velocity maps. Experimental results show that
SeismoLabV3+ achieves the best performance, with MAPE values of 0.03025 on the
internal validation split and 0.031246 on the hidden test set as scored via the
official ThinkOnward leaderboard. These findings demonstrate the suitability of
deep segmentation networks for seismic velocity inversion and underscore the
value of tailored architectural refinements in advancing geophysical AI models.

TL;DR: GMLv2是一个基于参考的音频质量预测模型，使用Beta分布损失函数建模听众评分，整合了神经音频编码主观数据集以提升泛化能力，在多种测试集上表现优于PEAQ和ViSQOL等传统指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够准确预测主观音频质量（MUSHRA评分）的自动化评估框架，以加速现代音频编码技术的研究和发展。

Method: 引入基于Beta分布的损失函数来建模听众评分，并整合额外的神经音频编码主观数据集来扩展模型的泛化能力和适用性。

Result: 在多样化测试集上的广泛评估表明，GMLv2在主观评分相关性方面持续优于广泛使用的PEAQ和ViSQOL等指标，并能可靠预测不同内容类型和编解码配置的音频质量。

Conclusion: GMLv2提供了一个可扩展且自动化的感知音频质量评估框架，有望加速现代音频编码技术的研究与发展。

Abstract: We present GMLv2, a reference-based model designed for the prediction of
subjective audio quality as measured by MUSHRA scores. GMLv2 introduces a Beta
distribution-based loss to model the listener ratings and incorporates
additional neural audio coding (NAC) subjective datasets to extend its
generalization and applicability. Extensive evaluations on diverse testset
demonstrate that proposed GMLv2 consistently outperforms widely used metrics,
such as PEAQ and ViSQOL, both in terms of correlation with subjective scores
and in reliably predicting these scores across diverse content types and codec
configurations. Consequently, GMLv2 offers a scalable and automated framework
for perceptual audio quality evaluation, poised to accelerate research and
development in modern audio coding technologies.

### [338] [HuLA: Prosody-Aware Anti-Spoofing with Multi-Task Learning for Expressive and Emotional Synthetic Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21676)
*Aurosweta Mahapatra,Ismail Rasim Ulgen,Berrak Sisman*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: HuLA是一个两阶段的韵律感知多任务学习框架，通过显式的韵律监督结合自监督学习嵌入，显著提高了对高级合成语音攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的反欺骗系统对富有表现力和情感的合成语音仍然脆弱，因为它们很少利用韵律作为区分线索。韵律是人类表达和情感的核心，人类本能地使用F0模式和清浊音结构等韵律线索来区分自然语音和合成语音。

Method: 提出HuLA两阶段框架：第一阶段在真实语音上训练自监督学习骨干网络，辅以F0预测和清浊音分类任务；第二阶段在真实和合成数据上联合优化欺骗检测和韵律任务，利用韵律感知检测自然语音与表达性合成语音之间的不匹配。

Result: 实验表明HuLA在具有挑战性的域外数据集上持续优于强基线，包括表达性、情感性和跨语言攻击。

Conclusion: 显式的韵律监督与自监督学习嵌入相结合，显著提高了对高级合成语音攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current anti-spoofing systems remain vulnerable to expressive and emotional
synthetic speech, since they rarely leverage prosody as a discriminative cue.
Prosody is central to human expressiveness and emotion, and humans
instinctively use prosodic cues such as F0 patterns and voiced/unvoiced
structure to distinguish natural from synthetic speech. In this paper, we
propose HuLA, a two-stage prosody-aware multi-task learning framework for spoof
detection. In Stage 1, a self-supervised learning (SSL) backbone is trained on
real speech with auxiliary tasks of F0 prediction and voiced/unvoiced
classification, enhancing its ability to capture natural prosodic variation
similar to human perceptual learning. In Stage 2, the model is jointly
optimized for spoof detection and prosody tasks on both real and synthetic
data, leveraging prosodic awareness to detect mismatches between natural and
expressive synthetic speech. Experiments show that HuLA consistently
outperforms strong baselines on challenging out-of-domain dataset, including
expressive, emotional, and cross-lingual attacks. These results demonstrate
that explicit prosodic supervision, combined with SSL embeddings, substantially
improves robustness against advanced synthetic speech attacks.
